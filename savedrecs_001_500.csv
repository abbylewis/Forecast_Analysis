Recent studies have revealed the effectiveness of early-warning mechanisms that enable the public reduce their exposure to air pollutants. This highlights the need for accurate air quality forecasts. However, air quality in many developing and highly urbanised countries remains unmonitored. Hence, a novel spatiotemporal interpolation modelling approach based on a deep learning and wavelet pre-processing technique was proposed in this paper. In more detail, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) were utilised to model the spatial variability of hourly NO2 levels at six urban sites in Central London, the United Kingdom. The models were trained using only the NO2 concentration data from the neighbouring sites. Benchmark models such as plain LSTM and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were also developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The proposed wavelet-based spatiotemporal models were found to provide superior forecasting results, explaining 77% to 93% of the variability of the actual NO2 concentration levels at most sites.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is under threat, with rapid changes of its reef-building hard coral (HC) community structure already evident across broad spatial scales. While several underlying relationships between HC and multiple disturbances have been documented, responses of other benthic communities to disturbances are not well understood. Here we used statistical modelling to explore the effects of broad-scale climate-related disturbances on benthic communities to predict their structure under scenarios of increasing disturbance frequency. We parameterized a multivariate model using the composition of benthic communities estimated by 145,000 observations from the northern GBR between 2012 and 2017. During this time, surveyed reefs were variously impacted by two tropical cyclones and two heat stress events that resulted in extensive HC mortality. This unprecedented sequence of disturbances was used to estimate the effects of discrete versus interacting disturbances on the compositional structure of HC, soft corals (SC) and algae. Discrete disturbances increased the prevalence of algae relative to HC while the interaction between cyclones and heat stress was the main driver of the increase in SC relative to algae and HC. Predictions from disturbance scenarios included relative increases in algae versus SC that varied by the frequency and types of disturbance interactions. However, high uncertainty of compositional changes in the presence of several disturbances shows that responses of algae and SC to the decline in HC needs further research. Better understanding of the effects of multiple disturbances on benthic communities as a whole is essential for predicting the future status of coral reefs and managing them in the light of new environmental regimes. The approach we develop here opens new opportunities for reaching this goal.",,,,,"Vercelloni, Julie/0000-0001-5227-014X",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; XL Catlin Ltd.,,,,0,0,20,20,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Here, we investigate how the dietary C:P ratio optimising consumer growth (TERC:P: Threshold Elemental Ratio) changes along temperature gradients by combining a temperature-dependent TERC:P model with growth experiments on Daphnia magna. Both lines of evidence show that the TERC:P response to temperature is U-shaped.

Approaches that enable the study of contemporary evolution, such as resurrection studies, are valuable for providing insights into the responses of populations to global change. In this study, we used a resurrection approach to study the evolution of the California native Leptosiphon bicolor (true babystars, Polemoniaceae) across populations differing in precipitation in response to the state's recent prolonged drought (2011-2017). In the Mediterranean climate region in which L. bicolor grows, this historic drought effectively shortened its growing season. We used seeds collected both before and after this drought from three populations found along a moisture availability gradient to assess contemporary evolution in a common garden greenhouse study. We coupled this with a drought experiment to examine plasticity. We found evolution toward earlier flowering after the historic drought in the wettest of the three populations, while plasticity to experimental drought was observed across all three. We also observed trade-offs associated with earlier flowering. In the driest population, plants that flowered earlier had lower intrinsic water-use efficiency than those flowering later, which was an expected pattern. Unexpectedly, earlier flowering plants had larger flowers. Two populations exhibited evolution and plasticity toward smaller flowers with drought. The third exhibited evolution toward larger flowers, but displayed no plasticity.

However, it remains unclear whether this trend will continue, preventing for accurate projections of ecosystem functioning and climate feedbacks. Several ecophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the timing of leaf emergence in response to changing environmental cues, but the relative importance of those mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we use 727,401 direct phenological observations of common European forest trees to examine the dominant controls on leaf-out. Using the emerging mechanisms, we forecast future trajectories of spring arrival and evaluate the consequences for forest carbon dynamics. By representing hypothesized relationships with autumn temperature, winter chilling, and the timing of spring onset, we accurately predicted reductions in the advance of leaf-out. There was a strong consensus between our empirical model and existing process-based models, revealing that the advance in leaf-out will not exceed 2 weeks over the rest of the century. We further estimate that, under a 'business-as-usual' climate scenario, earlier spring arrival will enhance NPP of temperate and boreal forests by similar to 0.2 Gt per year at the end of the century. In contrast, previous estimates based on a simple degree-day model range around 0.8 Gt. As such, the expected NPP is drastically reduced in our updated model relative to previous estimates-by a total of similar to 25 Gt over the rest of the century. These findings reveal important environmental constraints on the productivity of broad-leaved deciduous trees and highlight that shifting spring phenology is unlikely to slow the rate of warming by offsetting anthropogenic carbon emissions.",,,,,"Bastin, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-2602-7247",ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; DOB Ecology; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [758873]; Plant-for-the-Planet,"This work was supported by grants to C.M.Z. from the ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme, L.M. from the China Scholarship Council, and T.W.C. from DOB Ecology, Plant-for-the-Planet and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Here we used a multilevel Bayesian analysis of range-wide survey data for Adelie penguins to characterize multidecadal and annual effects of sea ice on population growth. We found that mean sea ice concentration at breeding colonies (i.e., ""prevailing"" environmental conditions) had robust nonlinear effects on multidecadal population trends and explained over 85% of the variance in mean population growth rates among sites. In contrast, despite considerable year-to-year fluctuations in abundance at most breeding colonies, annual sea ice fluctuations often explained less than 10% of the temporal variance in population growth rates. Our study provides an understanding of the spatially and temporally dynamic environmental factors that define the range limits of Adelie penguins, further establishing this iconic marine predator as a true sea ice obligate and providing a firm basis for projection under scenarios of future climate change. Yet, given the weak effects of annual sea ice relative to the large unexplained variance in year-to-year growth rates, the ability to generate useful short-term forecasts of Adelie penguin breeding abundance will be extremely limited.

Nitrogen (over) fertilization and atmospheric N deposition induce soil acidification, which is neutralized by soil inorganic carbon (SIC; carbonates), and carbon dioxide (CO2) is released to the atmosphere. For the first time, the loss of SIC stocks in response to N-induced soil acidification was estimated for Chinese croplands from 1980 to 2020 and forecasts were made up to 2100. The SIC stocks in croplands in 1980 were 2.16 Pg C (16.3 Mg C/ha) in the upper 40 cm, 7% (0.15 Pg C; 1.1 Mg C/ha) of which were lost from 1980 to 2020. During these 40 years, 7 million ha of cropland has become carbonate free. Another 37% of the SIC stocks may be lost up to 2100 in China, leaving 30 million ha of cropland (37.8%) without carbonates if N fertilization follows the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Compared to the BAU scenario, the reduction in N input by 15%-30% after 2020 (scenarios S1 and S2) will decrease carbonate dissolution by 18%-41%. If N input remains constant as noted in 2020 (S3) or decreases by 1% annually (S4), a reduction of up to 52%-67% in carbonate dissolution is expected compared to the BAU scenario. The presence of CaCO3 in the soil is important for various processes including acidity buffering, aggregate formation and stabilization, organic matter stabilization, microbial and enzyme activities, nutrient cycling and availability, and water permeability and plant productivity. Therefore, optimizing N fertilization and improving N-use efficiency are important for decreasing SIC losses from acidification. N application should be strictly calculated based on crop demand, and any overfertilization should be avoided to prevent environmental problems and soil fertility decline associated with CaCO3 losses.",,,,,"Raza, Sajjad/0000-0002-4811-6059","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41671295]; National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFD0200106]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B12007]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671295), National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFD0200106), 111 Project (B12007)",,,0,0,58,58,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The importance of interactions between these factors, however, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate how advances in mechanistic niche modelling can be used to integrate and assess the influence of these sources of uncertainty in forecasts of climate change impacts. We explored geographic variation in thermal tolerance (i.e. maximum and minimum thermal limits) and its potential for acclimation in juvenile European common frogs Rana temporaria along elevational gradients. Furthermore, we employed a mechanistic niche model (NicheMapR) to assess the relative contributions of phenotypic variation, acclimation and thermoregulation in determining the impacts of climate change on thermal safety margins and activity windows. Our analyses revealed that high-elevation populations had slightly wider tolerance ranges driven by increases in heat tolerance but lower potential for acclimation. Plausibly, wider thermal fluctuations at high elevations favour more tolerant but less plastic phenotypes, thus reducing the risk of encountering stressful temperatures during unpredictable extreme events. Biophysical models of thermal exposure indicated that observed phenotypic and plastic differences provide limited protection from changing climates. Indeed, the risk of reaching body temperatures beyond the species' thermal tolerance range was similar across elevations. In contrast, the ability to seek cooler retreat sites through behavioural adjustments played an essential role in buffering populations from thermal extremes predicted under climate change. Predicted climate change also altered current activity windows, but high-elevation populations were predicted to remain more temporally constrained than lowland populations. Our results demonstrate that elevational variation in thermal tolerances and acclimation capacity might be insufficient to buffer temperate amphibians from predicted climate change; instead, behavioural thermoregulation may be the only effective mechanism to avoid thermal stress under future climates.",,,,"Gonzalez-Nicieza, Alfredo Cesar/L-6285-2014; Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017; Enriquez-Urzelai, Urtzi/H-9778-2016","Gonzalez-Nicieza, Alfredo Cesar/0000-0003-4062-569X; Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Enriquez-Urzelai, Urtzi/0000-0001-5958-2250","Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [BES-2013-063203, CGL2012-40246-C02-01, CGL2012-40246-C02-02, CGL2017-86924-P]; ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher AwardAustralian Research Council","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: BES-2013-063203, CGL2012-40246-C02-01, CGL2012-40246-C02-02 and CGL2017-86924-P; ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award",,,0,0,3,3,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Quantifying patterns and developing models of spread are central to understanding drivers of invasion and forecasting future invasions. We investigated the utility of models for characterizing and predicting spread of emerald ash borer (EAB), quantified temporal dynamics of spread and identified correlates of county-level invasion risk. We estimated rates and frequency of EAB spread and length of long-distance jumps throughout the contiguous USA from 1997 to 2018 and compared observed patterns with model predictions. A time-to-event model was then developed at the county level to assess the influence of habitat characteristics and propagule pressure on invasion risk. The final model was used to forecast invasion risk across the contiguous USA. Range expansion by EAB accorded well with model predictions. Following the initial establishment phase, range expansion rates were biphasic, shifting to a faster, linear pattern around 2002 and then declining from 2015 onwards. From 2003 onwards, EAB invaded 6-134 new counties per year, including a mean of 14 discrete jumps per year averaging 93 +/- 7 SE km. Risk of spread was positively associated with proximity to previously invaded areas, human population density and densities of ash and non-ash trees in rural forests but negatively associated with temperature. Synthesis and applications. At the regional level, the invasion by emerald ash borer appears to be entering the saturation phase, indicating that most high-risk counties in the eastern USA have been invaded. Even though spread has recently slowed, counties in close proximity to invaded areas and that have high densities of humans and trees are at the greatest risk of becoming invaded. Taken together, our findings provide insight into historical and future dynamics of range expansion by emerald ash borer, which can be used to guide risk assessments for potential invaders capable of frequent long-distance dispersal.",,,,,,"National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology [1638702]; USDA Forest Service McIntire-Stennis programUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Czech Operational Programme Science, Research and Education [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_01 9/0000803]","National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1638702; USDA Forest Service McIntire-Stennis program; Czech Operational Programme Science, Research and Education, Grant/Award Number: CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_01 9/0000803",,,0,0,4,4,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We analysed ten million visual survey records, spanning the Australian continent and multiple decades and comprising the most common coastal reef fishes (335 species). We found that temperature indeed drives spatial and temporal changes in fish body size, but not consistently in the negative fashion expected. Around 55% of species were smaller in warmer waters (especially among small-bodied species), while 45% were bigger. The direction of a species' response to temperature through space was generally consistent with its response to temperature increase through time at any given location, suggesting that spatial trends could help forecast fish responses to long-term warming. However, temporal changes were about ten times faster than spatial trends (4% versus 40% body size change per 1 degrees C change through space and time, respectively). The rapid and variable responses of fish size to warming may herald unexpected impacts on ecosystem restructuring, with potentially greater consequences than if all species were shrinking.

Assessing a species' vulnerability and response to anthropogenic changes is often performed using one of two methods: correlative approaches that infer dispersal potential based on traits, such as wingspan or an index of mobility derived from expert opinion, or a mechanistic modeling approach that extrapolates displacement rates from empirical data on short-term movements. Here, we compare and evaluate the success of the correlative and mechanistic approaches using a mechanistic random-walk model of butterfly movement that incorporates relationships between wingspan and sex-specific movement behaviors. The model was parameterized with new data collected on four species of butterfly in the south of England, and we observe how wingspan relates to flight speeds, turning angles, flight durations, and displacement rates. We show that flight speeds and turning angles correlate with wingspan but that to achieve good prediction of displacement even over 10 min the model must also include details of sex- and species-specific movement behaviors. We discuss what factors are likely to differentially motivate the sexes and how these could be included in mechanistic models of dispersal to improve their use in ecological forecasting.",,,,"Evans, Luke Christopher/AAM-7967-2020","Evans, Luke Christopher/0000-0001-8649-0589",,,,,0,0,1,1,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Antipathy from these communities toward existing environmental management efforts present further obstacles related to green infrastructure placement. While hydrologic modeling has been highly utilized in decision support for green infrastructure placement, this technique does not consider ownership, access concerns, or the importance of visibility. Alternatively, participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) can provide a different perspective from hydrologic models, as they have the potential to forecast community perceptions of green infrastructure utility, rather than hydrological benefit. We use a mixed-methods approach to optimize green infrastructure site-selection that considers hydrologic vulnerabilities in the context of place-based knowledge and historical realities. Residents' perceptions of the locations of nuisance flooding were reported via participatory mapping within a paper-based survey (n = 95) conducted in the communities surrounding Walnut Creek, a historically African-American community in Raleigh, North Carolina. Hotspot analysis was used to identify statistically significant clustering, which was related to a correspondence between participant-indicated nuisance flooding sites and high flow accumulation cells. Comparison of the participatory and hydrologic hotspot analyses show some geospatial overlap for potential green infrastructure placement. We propose that, when undertaken with community input, green infrastructure installation in these downstream areas may help offset localized flooding patterns while facilitating greater trust with stormwater and environmental practitioners.",,,,,"Rivers, Louie/0000-0001-7240-6710; Supak, Stacy/0000-0001-5073-8271",American Rivers,This research was funded by American Rivers.,,,0,0,25,25,,,,0169-2046,1872-6062,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

Forest dieback is becoming increasingly frequent and extended, particularly in drought-prone regions. This is the case of the south-western Spanish Pyrenees, where keystone species such as Silver fir reach their xeric and southern distribution limits. While dieback of this species has been widely documented in this area, we still lack methodologies to forecast the vulnerability of these forests in response to increasing drought stress so as to anticipate their potential dieback in the future. Here we study multiple features of Silver fir forests and trees to evaluate whether previous growth rates and their growth trends are valid predictors of forest dieback. Further, we validate our methodology revisiting two Silver fir sites sampled two decades ago. The defoliation degree was strongly related with radial growth, and growth trends differed between moderately to highly defoliated trees and non-defoliated trees. Forests showing dieback, i.e., those in which 25% of the sampled trees showed defoliation > 50%, were located at low elevation and received less rainfall in summer than forests showing no dieback. Trees showing high defoliation presented lower growth rates than non-defoliated trees. Moreover, we ratified that defoliation has increased considerably over the last two decades in one of the two revisited sites, but we were unable to accurately forecast growth trends in both sites, particularly in the site not showing dieback. The retrospective assessment of growth rates and trends offers valuable information on the vulnerability of Silver fir trees to drought. However, we are still far from being able to forecast the vulnerability of Silver fir forests to increasing drought. A systematic monitoring of growth across a wide tree-ring network of sites might provide valuable information to advance in this direction.",,,,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [CGL201569186-C2-1-R, RTI2018-096884-B-C31]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [FJCI 201630121]","This study was supported by projects FunDiver (CGL201569186-C2-1-R) and FORMAL (RTI2018-096884-B-C31) from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities.

Predicting population collapse with the help of generic early warning signals (EWS) may provide a prospective tool for identifying species or populations at highest risk. However, pattern-to-process methods such as EWS have a multitude of challenges to overcome to be useful, including the low signal-to-noise ratio of ecological systems and the need for high quality time series data. The inclusion of trait dynamics with EWS has been proposed as a more robust tool to predict population collapse. However, the length and resolution of available time series are highly variable from one system to another, especially when generation time is considered. As yet, it remains unknown how this variability with regards to generation time will alter the efficacy of EWS. Here we take both a simulation- and experimental-based approach to assess the impacts of relative time series length and resolution on the forecasting ability of EWS. We show that EWS' performance decreases with decreasing time-series length. However, there was no evident decrease in EWS performance as resolution decreased. Our simulations suggest a relative time series length between 10 and five generations as a minimum requirement for accurate forecasting by abundance-based EWS. However, when trait information is included alongside abundance-based EWS, we find positive signals at lengths one-half of what was required without them. We suggest that, in systems where specific traits are known to affect demography, trait data should be monitored and included alongside abundance data to improve forecasting reliability.",,,,,"Clements, Christopher/0000-0001-5677-5401",ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [337785]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A-182286]; University of Zurich BUSS program; Forschungskredit [FK-18-082],"The authors declare no conflict of interests.

Understanding the factors that underlie tolerance of urbanization is thus of rapidly growing importance. Here, we examine urban tolerance across a diverse group of lizards: Caribbean members of the neotropical genus Anolis. Our analyses reveal that urban tolerance has strong phylogenetic signal, suggesting that closely related species tend to respond similarly to urban environments. We propose that this characteristic of urban tolerance in anoles may be used to forecast the possible responses of species to increasing urbanization. In addition, we identified several key ecological and morphological traits that tend to be associated with tolerance in Anolis. Specifically, species experiencing hot and dry conditions in their natural environment and those that maintain higher body temperatures tend to have greater tolerance of urban habitats. We also found that tolerance of urbanization is positively associated with toepad lamella number and negatively associated with ventral scale density and relative hindlimb length. The identification of factors that predispose a species to be more or less urban tolerant can provide a starting point for conservation and sustainable development in our increasingly urbanized world.",,,,"; Schliep, Klaus/F-5880-2012","Winchell, Kristin/0000-0002-5217-4809; Schliep, Klaus/0000-0003-2941-0161","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1354044, DEB 1350474]","We thank everyone who participated in our preliminary online survey and the many citizen scientists who have contributed to iNaturalist.

These correlations generally suffer from covariation of other confounding variables related to climate and other growth-limiting factors, as well as large uncertainties in total (dry + wet) reactive nitrogen (N-r) deposition. We propose a methodology for untangling the effects of N-dep from those of meteorological variables, soil water retention capacity and stand age, using a mechanistic forest growth model in combination with eddy covariance CO2 exchange fluxes from a Europe-wide network of 22 forest flux towers. Total N-r deposition rates were estimated from local measurements as far as possible. The forest data were compared with data from natural or semi-natural, non-woody vegetation sites. The response of forest net ecosystem productivity to nitrogen deposition (dNEP/dN(dep)) was estimated after accounting for the effects on gross primary productivity (GPP) of the co-correlates by means of a meta-modelling standardization procedure, which resulted in a reduction by a factor of about 2 of the uncorrected, apparent dGPP/dN(dep) value. This model-enhanced analysis of the C and N-dep flux observations at the scale of the European network suggests a mean overall dNEP/dN(dep) response of forest lifetime C sequestration to N-dep of the order of 40-50 g C per g N, which is slightly larger but not significantly different from the range of estimates published in the most recent reviews. Importantly, patterns of gross primary and net ecosystem productivity versus N-dep were non-linear, with no further growth responses at high N-dep levels (N-dep > 2.5-3 gNm(-2) yr(-1)) but accompanied by increasingly large ecosystem N losses by leaching and gaseous emissions. The reduced increase in productivity per unit N deposited at high N-dep levels implies that the forecast increased N-r emissions and increased N-dep levels in large areas of Asia may not positively impact the continent's forest CO2 sink. The large level of unexplained variability in observed carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE) across sites further adds to the uncertainty in the dC/dN response.",,,,"Matteucci, Giorgio/N-3526-2015; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Montagnani, Leonardo/L-9785-2019; INRA, UMR SAS/L-1751-2013","Matteucci, Giorgio/0000-0002-4790-9540; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Montagnani, Leonardo/0000-0003-2957-9071; Ibrom, Andreas/0000-0002-1341-921X; INRA, UMR SAS/0000-0001-6346-7845; Drewer, Julia/0000-0002-6263-6341","European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [017841, GOCE-CT-2003-505572, 282910]","This research has been supported by the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme (grant nos. 017841 and GOCE-CT-2003-505572) and European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (ECLAIRE, grant no. 282910).",,,1,1,2,2,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,26-Mar,2020,17,6,,,,,1621,1654,,10.5194/bg-17-1621-2020,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000522159700002,,,,,

SDMs have been criticized for not explicitly including the physiological processes underlying the species response to the environment. Recently, new methods have been suggested to combine SDMs with physiological estimates of performance (physiology-SDMs). In this study, we compare SDM and physiology-SDM predictions for select marine species in the Mediterranean Sea, a region subjected to exceptionally rapid climate change. We focused on six species and created physiology-SDMs that incorporate physiological thermal performance curves from experimental data with species occurrence records. We then contrasted projections of SDMs and physiology-SDMs under future climate (year 2100) for the entire Mediterranean Sea, and particularly the 'warm' trailing edge in the Levant region. Across the Mediterranean, we found cross-validation model performance to be similar for regular SDMs and physiology-SDMs. However, we also show that for around half the species the physiology-SDMs substantially outperform regular SDM in the warm Levant. Moreover, for all species the uncertainty associated with the coefficients estimated from the physiology-SDMs were much lower than in the regular SDMs. Under future climate, we find that both SDMs and physiology-SDMs showed similar patterns, with species predicted to shift their distribution north-west in accordance with warming sea temperatures. However, for the physiology-SDMs predicted distributional changes are more moderate than those predicted by regular SDMs. We conclude, that while physiology-SDM predictions generally agree with the regular SDMs, incorporation of the physiological data led to less extreme range shift forecasts. The results suggest that climate-induced range shifts may be less drastic than previously predicted, and thus most species are unlikely to completely disappear with warming climate. Taken together, the findings emphasize that physiological experimental data can provide valuable supplemental information to predict range shifts of marine species.",,,,,"Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359","BMBF-MOST, Israeli Science Foundation [1356/15]","Funding received from BMBF-MOST, Israeli Science Foundation no. 1356/15.",,,0,0,2,2,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/ecog.04423,,Mar-20,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000521607700001,,,,,

Forecasting where shifting sandy beaches will be obstructed and how that directly impacts coastal nesting species is necessary for successful conservation and management. Predicting changes to coastal nesting areas is difficult because of a lack of consensus on the physical attributes used by females in nesting site choice. In this study, we leveraged long-term data sets of nesting localities for two sea turtle species, loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, and green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, within four barrier island National Seashores in the southeastern United States to predict future nesting beach area based on where these species currently nest in relation to mean high water. We predicted the future location of nesting areas based on a sea level rise scenario for 2100 and quantified how impervious surfaces will inhibit future beach movement, which will impact both the total available nesting area and the percentage of nesting area predicted to flood following a hurricane-related storm surge. Contrary to our expectations, those barrier islands with the greatest levels of human infrastructure were not projected to experience the greatest percentage of sea turtle nesting area loss due to sea level rise or storm surge events. Notably, loss of nesting beach areas will not have equal impacts across the four Seashores; the Seashore projected to have the least amount of total nesting area lost and percentage nesting area lost currently has the highest nesting densities of our two study species, suggesting that even low levels of beach loss could have substantial impacts on future nesting densities and disproportionate impacts on the population growth of these species. Our novel method of estimating current and future nesting beach area can be broadly applied to studies requiring a bounded area that encompasses the part of a beach used by nesting coastal species and will be useful in comparing future global nesting densities and population trajectories under projected future sea level rise and storm surge activity.",,,,,,NPS [P16AC01137]; University of Central Florida,"The authors would like to thank Kristen Kneifl, C.

Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.",,,,"Hay, Simon/F-8967-2015","Hay, Simon/0000-0002-0611-7272",University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology; UGA Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U01GM110744],"This work was supported through the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology, the UGA Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities and National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number U01GM110744.

A necessary step forward is to assess the reliability of global trait predictions. In this study, we predict community mean plant traits at the global scale and present a systematic evaluation of their reliability in terms of the accuracy of the models, ecological realism and various sources of uncertainty. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We predicted global distributions of community mean specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration, plant height and wood density with an ensemble modelling approach based on georeferenced, locally measured trait data representative of the plant community. We assessed the predictive performance of the models, the plausibility of predicted trait combinations, the influence of data quality, and the uncertainty across geographical space attributed to spatial extrapolation and diverging model predictions. Results Ensemble predictions of community mean plant height, specific leaf area and wood density resulted in ecologically plausible trait-environment relationships and trait-trait combinations. Leaf nitrogen concentration, however, could not be predicted reliably. The ensemble approach was better at predicting community trait means than any of the individual modelling techniques, which varied greatly in predictive performance and led to divergent predictions, mostly in African deserts and the Arctic, where predictions were also extrapolated. High data quality (i.e., including intraspecific variability and a representative species sample) increased model performance by 28%. Main conclusions Plant community traits can be predicted reliably at the global scale when using an ensemble approach and high-quality data for traits that mostly respond to large-scale environmental factors. We recommend applying ensemble forecasting to account for model uncertainty, using representative trait data, and more routinely assessing the reliability of trait predictions.",,,,"Lopez, Ana Benitez/O-3396-2014; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Lopez, Ana Benitez/0000-0002-6432-1837; Higuchi, Pedro/0000-0002-3855-555X; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Hattingh, Wesley/0000-0002-3626-5137; Cerabolini, Bruno Enrico Leone/0000-0002-3793-0733; Boonman, Coline/0000-0003-2417-1579",H2020 European Research Council [647224],"H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 647224",,,0,0,2,2,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

For instance, arid and semi-arid environments experience a high level of uncertainty in rainfall, which results in unforeseen periods of droughts, or high-intensity rainfall, which generates severe floods, increasing the water insecurity and flood damage in these areas. Climate pattern variations are specifically critical to forecast conditions for flood hazard management. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are useful tools to forecast future climate change scenarios. However, the application of GCM in flood hazard management is particularly challenging, given that they operate under high uncertainty and coarse scale. In this context, a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map was generated by using a multi criteria index approach, based on defining the greater influence of seven factors related to flood generation: runoff coefficient, elevation, slope, distance from the drainage network, rainfall intensity, soil erosion and land use. In this paper, we utilized monthly data for the baseline period (1980-2004), and then the output of 8 GCMs for surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation were downscaled using a statistical model and evaluated in the baseline period. Consequently, the most suitable models were selected according to their average monthly performance. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was then used to develop a runoff coefficient map, using the downscaled outputs of the selected GCMs. Accordingly, a flood hazard model was developed at a large basin in the northeast of Iran for baseline and future periods (2040-2064) under RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. Having validated the generated flood map for the baseline period, the future maps were generated and compared. Results show the increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation; however, it was found that rainfall intensities are to be increased. This supports the final flood hazard map for the future climate conditions scenario with an increased relative hazard level. This was particularly observed in flat, and moderate sloped areas, compared to the model results with historic climate data.",,,,"Shadmehri Toosi, Amirhossein/G-4418-2018","Shadmehri Toosi, Amirhossein/0000-0001-8325-4185; Alaghmand, Sina/0000-0002-5568-4732",,,,,0,0,4,4,,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

The 'try-harder' hypothesis predicts that alien plants will be functionally dissimilar to natives and should thus exhibit exaggerated trait values when compared to natives in respect to resource extraction or stress tolerance. In contrast, the 'join-the-locals' hypothesis, which is compatible with ""environmental filtering"", predicts functional similarities among alien and native species in richer, but not in resource-limited environments. Here, we propose a framework that links the successful alien plant strategy, i.e. being functionally similar or dissimilar to natives, to the harshness of the environment and the availability of resources. We tested these two hypotheses using a trait-environment dataset of 33 alien and 130 native plants in 96 sites covering a gradient of soil resources (organic matter, nitrogen, soil moisture) in Saint-Katherine, an arid protected area in Egypt. We estimated 18 interaction coefficients between three candidate traits (specific leaf area, above-ground biomass, height) of alien and native plants as well as soil resources using linear mixed-effects models. Additionally, we calculated the mean and the hierarchical functional distance among aliens and natives along soil gradients. Our results revealed that in extreme resource-limited environments, aliens and natives were functionally similar and had relatively equal trait values consistent with environmental filtering, thus supporting the 'join-the-locals' hypothesis. However, in environments richer in resources, aliens and natives were functionally dissimilar with aliens exhibiting more exploitative trait values (taller, higher SLA and biomass) than natives, providing support for the 'try-harder' hypothesis. While demonstrated in only one arid system, results suggest that linking soil resource availability with functional divergence and convergence among native and alien plants could be used as an informative strategy to predict alien invasiveness. Hence, future studies should investigate the functional response of alien and native plants in different environments against different resource gradients to test for the generality of the patterns we found.",,,,"Bacher, Sven/F-5431-2010","Bacher, Sven/0000-0001-5147-7165; El-barougy, Dr Reham/0000-0001-8387-1706",Office Federal de l'Education et de la Science [ESKAS 2018.07.30],Funding was provided by Office Federal de l'Education et de la Science (ESKAS 2018.07.30).,,,0,0,7,7,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

One such species is Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), a cold-adapted mesocarnivore that maintains a large core population in Alaska, USA, and Canada but exists within several peripheral populations in the contiguous United States. Increases in temperature, declines in snow pack, and climate-influenced increases in fire frequency and intensity, could negatively affect lynx populations, threatening their long-term persistence in the continental United States. Despite these threats, our understanding of broad-scale effects on lynx occupancy and the extent of current lynx distribution in many of these peripheral populations is minimal. We conducted an occupancy survey of lynx in Washington, USA, using a spatially extensive camera-trapping array covering 7,000 km(2) of potential lynx habitat. We used the resulting database of detection data to develop single-season occupancy models to examine the abiotic and biotic effects on current lynx occupancy and predict future lynx distribution based on climate change forecasts. Our results show lynx occupancy across the Washington landscape is restricted and dictated largely by abiotic factors, disturbance regimes, and distance from source populations in Canada. Predictions of future distribution suggest lynx will be increasingly challenged by climatic changes, particularly at the southern and lower elevation portions of their range in Washington. Our results paint an alarming picture for lynx persistence in Washington that is relevant to current deliberations regarding lynx delisting from the Endangered Species Act. Our simple camera design was a highly effective method for surveying lynx across broad spatial scales, and could be a key monitoring tool for lynx that is easy to implement by researchers and government agencies.

We used a rainout shelter and water addition to test effects of seasonal precipitation on soil water and annual net primary production of C-3 perennial grass, C-4 perennial grass, annual grasses, forbs, and all plants combined. Treatments were 1) drought during September-October and April-May (DD); 2) drought plus irrigation during September-October and drought during April-May (WD); 3) year-long ambient conditions (WW); and 4) ambient plus irrigation during September-October (W + W). Treatments created conditions ranking among the driest and wettest September-October periods since 1937. Fall water effects on soil water were not detectable by May at 15 cm and 30 cm. Effects persisted into July at 60 cm and 90 cm, depths below the primary root zone. With spring drought, annual net primary production was 344 kg ha(-1) greater when the previous fall was wet rather than dry. No differences were detected between fall water treatments when spring was wet and fall was about 184% (1 938 +/- 117 kg ha(-1)) or 391% of the median (1 903 +/- 117 kg ha(-1)). Fall water increased C-3 perennial grass when spring was also wet and had no effect under spring drought, when forage production concerns are greatest. Fall water did not affect C-4 perennial grass, and extremely wet fall conditions reduced forb production about 50%. The greatest effect of fall water was increased annual grass production. Even record high levels of fall water had minor effects on biomass, functional group composition, and soil water that were short-lived and overwhelmed by the influence of spring precipitation. Movement of fall water to deep soil by the growing season suggests plants that would most benefit from fall precipitation are those that could use it during fall (winter annuals), or deep-rooted species (shrubs).

While the Allee effect (where individuals in low-density populations suffer lowered fitness) is known to influence both the ecological and the evolutionary dynamics of an invasion, the possibility that an invader's susceptibility to the Allee effect might itself evolve has received little attention. Since invasion fronts are regions of perpetually low population density, selection should be expected to favor vanguard invaders that are resistant to Allee effects. This may not only cause invasions to accelerate over time but, by mitigating the Allee effects experienced by the vanguard, also make the invasion transition from a pushed wave, propelled by dispersal from behind the invasion front, to a pulled wave, driven instead by the invasion vanguard. To examine this possibility, we construct an individual-based model in which a trait that governs resistance to the Allee effect is allowed to evolve during an invasion. We find that vanguard invaders evolve resistance to the Allee effect, causing invasions to accelerate. This results in invasions transforming from pushed waves to pulled waves, an outcome with consequences for invasion speed, population genetic structure, and other emergent behaviors. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for evolution in invasion forecasts and suggest that evolution has the capacity to fundamentally alter invasion dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,2,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This has led to calls for experiments that explore the sensitivity of ecosystems over broad ranges of climatic parameter space. However, because such response surface experiments have so far been limited in geographic and biological scope, it is not clear if differences between studies reflect geographic location or the ecosystem component considered. In this study, we manipulated rainfall entering tank bromeliads in seven sites across the Neotropics, and characterized the response of the aquatic ecosystem in terms of invertebrate functional composition, biological stocks (total invertebrate biomass, bacterial density) and ecosystem fluxes (decomposition, carbon, nitrogen). Of these response types, invertebrate functional composition was the most sensitive, even though, in some sites, the species pool had a high proportion of drought-tolerant families. Total invertebrate biomass was universally insensitive to rainfall change because of statistical averaging of divergent responses between functional groups. The response of invertebrate functional composition to rain differed between geographical locations because (1) the effect of rainfall on bromeliad hydrology differed between sites, and invertebrates directly experience hydrology not rainfall and (2) the taxonomic composition of some functional groups differed between sites, and families differed in their response to bromeliad hydrology. These findings suggest that it will be difficult to establish thresholds of ""safe ecosystem functioning"" when ecosystem components differ in their sensitivity to climatic variables, and such thresholds may not be broadly applicable over geographic space. In particular, ecological forecast horizons for climate change may be spatially restricted in systems where habitat properties mediate climatic impacts, and those, like the tropics, with high spatial turnover in species composition.",,,,"de Omena, Paula Munhoz/C-5641-2009; Romero, Gustavo Q/H-8974-2012","de Omena, Paula Munhoz/0000-0002-5221-7901; MacDonald, Andrew/0000-0003-1162-169X; Srivastava, Diane/0000-0003-4541-5595; Cereghino, Regis/0000-0003-3981-3159; CORBARA, Bruno/0000-0003-4232-8234; Barberis, Ignacio Martin/0000-0002-6605-9270; Romero, Gustavo Q/0000-0003-3736-4759; Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12BSV7-0022-01]; Investissement d'Avenir grant (Labex CEBA)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT-2010-1614]; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Universidad Nacional de Rosario [AGR-139]; Brazilian Council for Research, Development and Innovation (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [400454/2014-9]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2012/51143-3, 2016/01209-9]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de los Andes, Colombia [2012-1]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/04603-4]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES [PNPD-CAPES 2013/0877, PNPD-CAPES 2014/04603-4]; Fond Social Europeen; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of British Columbia; Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS)Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias [567]","We appreciate fieldwork assistance by T.

Here we rely on Liebig's Law of Minimum to estimate the effect of temperature on the maximum potential abundance that a species can attain at a certain location. We develop 95%-quantile regressions to model the influence of effective temperature sum on the maximum potential abundance of 25 common understory plant species of Finland, along 868 nationwide plots sampled in 1985. Fifteen of these species showed a significant response to temperature sum that was consistent in temperature-only models and in all-predictors models, which also included cumulative precipitation, soil texture, soil fertility, tree species and stand maturity as predictors. For species with significant and consistent responses to temperature, we forecasted potential shifts in abundance for the period 2041-2070 under the IPCC A1B emission scenario using temperature-only models. We predict major potential changes in abundance and average northward distribution shifts of 6-8 km yr(-1). Our results emphasize inter-specific differences in the impact of global warming on the understory layer of boreal forests. Species in all functional groups from dwarf shrubs, herbs and grasses to bryophytes and lichens showed significant responses to temperature, while temperature did not limit the abundance of 10 species. We discuss the interest of modelling the 'maximum potential abundance' to deal with the uncertainty in the predictions of realized abundances associated to the effect of environmental factors not accounted for and to dispersal limitations of species, among others. We believe this concept has a promising and unexplored potential to forecast the impact of specific drivers of global change under future scenarios.",,,,"Villen-Perez, Sara/H-2226-2014","Villen-Perez, Sara/0000-0003-1832-1817","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [140766, 312912]; Comunidad de MadridComunidad de MadridInstituto de Salud Carlos III; Univ. de Alcala [CM/JIN/2019-003]; TALENTO Fellowship, Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid [2017-T2/AMB-6035]","This research was partially funded by the Academy of Finland (grants 140766 and 312912) and by Comunidad de Madrid in agreement with Univ. de Alcala under the program for support of young scientists' research (CM/JIN/2019-003).

These three factors hinder the design and conduct of King Penguin censuses, and assessments of trend often require piecing together mismatched surveys of different demographic components. This study introduces a new method to remotely census these populations year-round and correct population estimates for the King Penguin's unique breeding phenology. We combined in situ ground counts with estimates based on high-resolution satellite imagery to catalog the distribution of breeding colonies and estimate population abundance across the island of South Georgia, in the south Atlantic. While most King Penguin populations are forecast to decline significantly over the next century, South Georgia is expected to experience more favorable conditions and represents an important refugium for the species, though the challenges of surveying King Penguins have precluded a comprehensive census. Due to the variable timing of both in situ and remote counts, we developed a discrete time, age- and stage-structured population model that provides stage- and day-specific correction factors for standardization of census counts. We estimate the current population of King Penguins on South Georgia as 405,425 (95% CI 102,624-2,375,061) breeding pairs and find that population trends that do not account for phenological biases persistently underestimate the population growth rate. Correction factors are highly sensitive to annual egg mortality and the total breeding population is best estimated using nest counts of early-breeding pairs. Future efforts to census King Penguin populations may minimize uncertainty by capturing more precise estimates of egg survival and optimizing the timing of ground and satellite censuses to occur during the settlement of early breeders. Accounting for the error associated with current uncertainty in model parameters, 18-32 years of census data would be required to accurately detect trends of a population with a 10% growth rate. While asynchronously breeding species present a unique challenge to population monitoring, careful accounting of within-season dynamics can be used to assemble a self-consistent time series from heterogeneous survey data.",,,,,,"US National Science Foundation Office of Polar ProgramsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF/OPP-1255058]; Polar Geospatial Center under NSF-OPP [1043681, 1559691]","We gratefully acknowledge assistance from the US National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (Award No. NSF/OPP-1255058) and geospatial support provided by the Polar Geospatial Center under NSF-OPP awards 1043681 and 1559691.

Some systems, however, have been shown to avoid critical slowing down prior to a transition between equilibria (Ditlevsen and Johnsen 2010; Hastings and Wysham Ecology Letters 13(4):464-472 2010). Possible explanations include a non-smooth potential driving the dynamic (Hastings and Wysham Ecology Letters 13(4):464-472 2010) or large perturbations driving the system out of the initial basin of attraction (Boettiger and Batt 2018). In this paper, we discuss a phenomenon analogous to critical slowing down, where a slow parameter change leads to a high likelihood of a regime shift and creates signature warning signs in the statistics of the process's sample paths. This effect, which we dub ""critical speeding up,"" is demonstrated using a simple population model exhibiting an Allee effect. In short, if a basin of attraction is compressed under a parameter change then the potential well steepens, leading to a drop in the time series' variance and autocorrelation; precisely the opposite warning signs exhibited by critical slowing down. The fact that either falling or rising variance / autocorrelation can indicate imminent state change should underline the need for reliable modeling of any empirical system where one desires to forecast regime change.",,,,,"Titus, Mathew/0000-0001-5245-714X",DARPA YFA project [N66001-17-1-4038],The authors would like to acknowledge support from the DARPA YFA project N66001-17-1-4038 and to thank George Hagstrom for helpful conversations that led to the population model above.

In this study, the genetic diversity of five populations of Cicer graecum, an endangered endemic species from northern Peloponnisos, Greece and a wild relative of the cultivated Cicer arietinum, was investigated using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in order to determine levels and structure of genetic variability. Nei's gene diversity by ISSR and AFLP markers indicated medium to high genetic diversity at the population level. Moreover, AMOVA results suggest that most of the variation exists within (93 % for AFLPs and 65 % for ISSRs), rather than among populations. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis based on ISSRs positively correlated the genetic differentiation among the populations to the geographic distances, suggesting that the gene flow among distant populations is limited. The ecological adaptation of C. graecum populations was also investigated by correlation of their genetic diversity with certain environmental variables. Aridity arose as the dominant factor positively affecting the genetic diversity of C. graecum populations. We modelled the realized climatic niche of C. graecum in an ensemble forecasting scheme under three different global circulation models and two climate change scenarios. In all cases, a severe range contraction for C. graecum is projected, highlighting the high extinction risk that is probably going to face during the coming decades.

Sustainable development also involves the exploitation of environmental resources, investment orientation, technology development, and industrial changes in a coordinated form. This paper studies the multi-objective sustainable land use planning problem and proposes an integrated framework, including simulation, forecasting, and optimization approaches for this problem. Land use optimization, a multifaceted process, requires complex decisions, including selection of land uses, forecasting land use allocation percentage, and assigning locations to land uses. The land use allocation percentage in the selected horizons is simulated and predicted by designing a System Dynamics (SD) model based on socio-economic variables. Furthermore, land use assignment is accomplished with a multi-objective integer programming model that is solved using augmented epsilon-constraint and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) methods. According to the results of the SD model, land use changes depend on population growth rate and labor productivity variables. Among the possible scenarios, a scenario focusing more on sustainable planning is chosen and the forecasting results of this scenario are used for optimal land use allocation. The computational results show that the augmented epsilon-constraint method cannot solve this problem even for medium sizes. The NSGA-II method not only solves the problem at large sizes over a reasonable time, but also generates good-quality solutions. NSGA-II showed better performance in metrics, including number of non-dominated Pareto solutions (NNPS), mean ideal distance (MID), and dispersion metric (DM). Integrated framework is implemented to allocate four types of land uses consisting of residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural to a given region with 900 cells.",,,,,"Ramezanian, Reza/0000-0001-7013-7713",,,,,0,0,4,4,,,,1860-1871,1860-188X,,LANDSC ECOL ENG,Landsc.

Chemical analysis of pollen grains has the potential to increase the taxonomic resolution of pollen analysis, but present-day chemical variability is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate whether a phylogenetic signal is present in the chemical variations of Quercus L. pollen and to assess the prospects of chemical techniques for identification in biogeographical research. Location Portugal. Taxon Six taxa (five species, one subspecies) of Quercus L., Q. faginea, Q. robur, Q. robur ssp. estremadurensis, Q. coccifera, Q. rotundifolia and Q. suber belonging to three sections: Cerris, Ilex and Quercus (Denk, Grimm, Manos, Deng, & Hipp, 2017). Methods We collected pollen samples from 297 individual Quercus trees across a 4 degrees (similar to 450 km) latitudinal gradient and determined chemical differences using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We used canonical powered partial least squares regression (CPPLS) and discriminant analysis to describe within- and between-species chemical variability. Results We find clear differences in the FTIR spectra from Quercus pollen at the section level (Cerris: similar to 98%; Ilex: similar to 100%; Quercus: similar to 97%). Successful discrimination is based on spectral signals related to lipids and sporopollenins. However, discrimination of species within individual Quercus sections is more challenging: overall, species recall is similar to 76% and species misidentifications within sections lie between 18% and 31% of the test set. Main Conclusions Our results demonstrate that subgenus level differentiation of Quercus pollen is possible using FTIR methods, with successful classification at the section level. This indicates that operator-independent FTIR approaches can surpass traditional morphological techniques using light microscopy. Our results have implications both for providing new insights into past colonization pathways of Quercus, and likewise for forecasting future responses to climate change. However, before FTIR techniques can be applied more broadly across palaeoecology and biogeography, our results also highlight a number of research challenges that still need to be addressed, including developing sporopollenin-specific taxonomic discriminators and determining a more complete understanding of the effects of environmental variation on pollen-chemical signatures in Quercus.",,,,"Vila-Vicosa, Carlos/AAI-6016-2020; Muthreich, Florian/AAH-6946-2020; Zimmermann, Boris/N-8297-2014; Birks, H.

To assess multiscale responses to thermal perturbation of corals in the Coral Triangle (CT), we developed a spatially explicit metacommunity model with coral-algal competition, including seasonal larval dispersal and external spatiotemporal forcing. We tested coral sensitivity in 2,083 reefs across the CT region and surrounding areas under potential future temperature regimes, with and without interannual climate variability, exploring a range of 0.5-2.0 degrees C overall increase in temperature in the system by 2054. We found that among future projections, reef survival probability and mean percent coral cover over time were largely determined by the presence or absence of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) extremes as well as absolute temperature increase. Overall, reefs that experienced SST time series that were filtered to remove interannual variability had approximately double the chance of survival than reefs subjected to unfiltered SST. By the end of the forecast period, the inclusion of thermal anomalies was equivalent to an increase of at least 0.5 degrees C in SST projections without anomalies. Change in percent coral cover varied widely across the region within temperature scenarios, with some reefs experiencing local extinction while others remaining relatively unchanged. Sink strength and current thermal stress threshold were found to be significant drivers of these patterns, highlighting the importance of processes that underlie larval connectivity and bleaching sensitivity in coral networks.",,,,"; Vasconcelos, Vitor/O-7667-2015","Curchitser, Enrique/0000-0002-8144-0352; Vasconcelos, Vitor/0000-0002-4621-5272","Global Economic Dynamics and Biosphere Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1848576]; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS) Rapid Switch Research Community; Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University; SEReNe program through Princeton University; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; New Jersey Sea Grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Sea Grant, U.S. Department of CommerceNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA140AR4170203]; New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium","Global Economic Dynamics and Biosphere Program; National Science Foundation Grant, Grant/Award Number: OCE-1848576; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (PIIRS) Rapid Switch Research Community; Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University; SEReNe program administered through Princeton University; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; New Jersey Sea Grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Sea Grant, U.S. Department of Commerce, Grant/Award Number: #NA140AR4170203; New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium",,,0,0,50,50,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Yet, empirical studies have rarely focused on temporal covariation and autocorrelation limiting our understanding of these patterns in natural populations. This lack of knowledge restrains our ability to fully understand population dynamics and to make reliable population forecasts. In order to fill this gap, we used a long-term monitoring (15 years) of a kestrel Falco tinnunculus population to investigate covariation and autocorrelation in survival and reproduction at the population level and their impact on population dynamics. Using Bayesian joint analyses, we found support for positive covariation between survival and reproduction, but weak autocorrelation through time. This positive covariation was stronger in juveniles compared with adults. As expected for a specialized predator, we found that the reproductive performance was strongly related to an index of vole abundance explaining 86% of the temporal variation. This very strong relationship suggests that the temporally variable prey abundance may drive the positive covariation between survival and reproduction in this kestrel population. Simulations suggested that the observed effect size of covariation could be strong enough to affect population dynamics. More generally, positive covariation and autocorrelation have a destabilizing effect increasing substantially the temporal variability of population size.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Despite evidence of density-dependence effects on condition in some species, previous research has not jointly estimated synchronous changes in condition and density operating at fine spatial scales (a few km). Therefore, we developed a spatio-temporal modeling approach that simultaneously estimates correlated variation in density (measured as numbers per area) and condition. We applied our approach to 6 eastern Bering Sea (EBS) groundfish species (4 flatfishes and 2 gadoids) for the period 1992-2016, and estimated correlations in spatial variation (unmeasured variation that is stable over time) and spatio-temporal variation (unmeasured variation that changes between years). Spatial variation in density had a strong significant negative association with spatial variation in condition for 3 flatfishes and a positive association for one gadoid. Spatio-temporal variation in density had a significant association with spatio-temporal variation in condition for one flatfish (negative) and one gadoid (positive). Moreover, for the 6 study species, bottom temperature was identified as an important predictor of both density and condition. The increasing trend in bottom temperatures between 1992 and 2016 was accompanied by an overall increase in the abundance-weighted condition of 5 species. We conclude that forecasts of changes in weight-at-age within some EBS groundfish assessments will require an understanding of both density-dependence and bottom temperature effects on fish condition to better prepare for future climate and exploitation changes.",,,,,,Habitat Information for Stock Assessments program [17-034],"The present work was funded by the Habitat Information for Stock Assessments program (grant number 17-034).

High uncertainty in biological processes makes the accurate prediction of the outcomes of management interventions very challenging. Adaptive management (AM) offers solutions to reduce uncertainty and improve predictability so that the outcomes of interventions can continuously improve. We quantitatively assess the extent to which AM is used for managing vertebrates, with a focus on invasive non-native species (INNS). Using the Web of Science, we evaluated 3992 articles returned by the search terms 'adaptive management' or 'adaptive harvest management' against seven recommended elements of AM (engagement with stakeholders, defining objectives, forecasting and estimating uncertainty, implementing management, monitoring populations, adjusting management in response to monitoring, and improving forecasting and reducing uncertainty in response to monitoring populations). The use of AM for vertebrates was reported in 56 (1%) of the evaluated studies; including four for managing INNS. Of these, ten studies excluding INNS and no studies of INNS management implemented all seven recommended elements of AM. Those elements infrequently implemented were as follows: the use of analysis or models to forecast and represent uncertainty (44%) and the feedback of monitoring data to improve forecasting and reduce uncertainty (25%). Complete active AM has rarely been implemented and reported for managing INNS, despite the significant advantages it offers. Among studies purporting to have implemented AM, most did not use analyses or models to forecast and represent uncertainty, while most defined objectives, implemented management, and monitored populations. Improvements to ongoing control programmes and much broader adoption of the AM approach are required to increase the efficiency and success of INNS management campaigns and reduce their negative impacts on native species.",,,,,,,,,,3,3,20,20,,,,0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,APR,2020,50,2,,,SI,,147,156,,10.1111/mam.12182,,Feb-20,,Ecology; Zoology,,,WOS:000511234300001,,,,,

As a main component of litter, cellulose is a vital energy source for the microbes associated with litter decomposition. The important role of cellulolytic enzymes in litter cellulose degradation is well understood, but seasonal patterns of cellulose degradation and whether cumulative enzyme activities and litter quality forecast cellulose degradation in an alpine meadow remain elusive, which limits our understanding of cellulose degradation in herbaceous plant litter. Methods A two-year field litterbag experiment involving three dominant species (Ajuga ovalifolia, Festuca wallichanica, and Pedicularis roylei) was conducted in an alpine meadow of the eastern Tibetan Plateau to explore the seasonal patterns of cellulose degradation and how cumulative cellulolytic enzyme activities and initial litter quality impact cellulose degradation. Important findings Our study demonstrates that cellulose degraded rapidly and exceeded 50% during the first year, which mainly occurred in the first growing season (31.9%-43.3%). At two years of decomposition, cellulose degradation was driven by cumulative endoglucanase (R-2 = 0.70), cumulative cellobiohydrolase (R-2 = 0.59) and cumulative 1,4-beta-glucosidase (R-2 = 0.57). In addition, the concentrations of cellulose, dissolved organic carbon, total phenol, lignin and lignin/N accounted for 52%-78% of the variation in cellulose degradation during the two years of decomposition. The best model for predicting cellulose degradation was the initial cellulose concentration (R-2 = 0.78). The enzymatic efficiencies and the allocation of cellulolytic enzyme activities were different among species. The cellulolytic enzyme efficiencies were higher in the litter of F. wallichanica with relatively lower quality. For the complete cellulose degradation of the leaf litter, A. ovalifolia and F. wallichanica required 4-fold and 6.7-fold more endoglucanase activity, 3-fold and 4.5-fold more cellobiohydrolase activity and 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold more 1,4-beta-glucosidase activity, respectively, than those required by P. roylei. Our results demonstrated that although microbial activity and litter quality both have significant impacts on cellulose degradation in an alpine meadow, using cellulose concentration to predict cellulose degradation is a good way to simplify the model of cellulose degradation and C cycling during litter decomposition.",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200345, 31570605, 31370628]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201706910039]","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31200345, 31570605 and 31370628].

Now, an emergent challenge is to understand the consequences of shifts and losses in such habitat-forming species for associated communities and ecosystem processes. Recently, consecutive coral bleaching events shifted the morphological makeup of habitat-forming coral assemblages on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Considering the disparity of coral morphological growth forms in shelter provision for reef fishes, we investigated how shifts in the morphological structure of coral assemblages affect the abundance of juvenile and adult reef fishes. We used a temporal dataset from shallow reefs in the northern GBR to estimate coral convexity (a fine-scale quantitative morphological trait) and two widely used coral habitat descriptors (coral cover and reef rugosity) for disentangling the effects of coral morphology on reef fish assemblages. Changes in coral convexity, rather than live coral cover or reef rugosity, disproportionately affected juvenile reef fishes when compared to adults, and explained more than 20% of juvenile decline. The magnitude of this effect varied by fish body size with juveniles of small-bodied species showing higher vulnerability to changes in coral morphology. Our findings suggest that continued large-scale shifts in the relative abundance of morphological groups within coral assemblages are likely to affect population replenishment and dynamics of future reef fish communities. The different responses of juvenile and adult fishes according to habitat descriptors indicate that focusing on coarse-scale metrics alone may mask fine-scale ecological responses that are key to understand ecosystem functioning and resilience. Nonetheless, quantifying coral morphological traits may contribute to forecasting the structure of reef fish communities on novel reef ecosystems shaped by climate change.",,,,"Stephanie, D'agata/AAN-3692-2020; Dornelas, Maria/E-3595-2010","Stephanie, D'agata/0000-0001-6941-8489; Alvarez-Noriega, Mariana/0000-0003-1295-6897; Maina, Joseph/0000-0003-1268-6137; Luiz, Osmar/0000-0002-6995-6524; Madin, Joshua/0000-0002-5005-6227; Torres-Pulliza, Damaris/0000-0002-2594-197X; Dornelas, Maria/0000-0003-2077-7055",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council [COE140100020]; John Templeton Foundation [60501],,,,1,1,30,31,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The objective of this study was to build spatial niche models of five species of Cactaceae (Arrojadoa penicillata, Brasilicereus phaeacanthus, Pereskia aureiflora, Stephanocereus leucostele and Tacinga inamoena) endemic to the Caatinga and with different traits, to evaluate the impact of climate change on their geographical distribution. The species records and environmental variable values were overlaid on a grid of 6818 cells with 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. Niche models were obtained for five types of general circulation models between ocean and atmosphere and 12 different ecological models. The ensemble ecological niche model was calculated at present and projected to past (last glacial maximum - LGM, 21 000; and mid-Holocene - Hol, 6000 years ago) and future climate conditions (average of 2080), under the effect of climate change, in the greenhouse gas emission scenario RCP4.5. The distribution pattern of the studied species indicates an area with less environmental suitability in the LGM, followed by an expansion that began in the Hol and continued until the present period. In the future (2080), the models predicted a retraction of areas of environmental suitability, in which P. aureiflora and B. phaeacanthus, given their more restricted, marginal habitat and woody habit, present a great risk of extinction, whilst S. leucostele, A. penicillata and T. inamoena present a smaller reduction in suitable area, partly reflecting their spreading, less woody habit.

Yet, biodiversity scenarios have so far concentrated on climatic effects because forecasts of land use are rarely available at appropriate spatial and thematic scales. Agent-based models (ABMs) represent a potentially powerful but little explored tool for establishing thematically and spatially fine-grained land-use scenarios. Here, we use an ABM parameterized for 1,329 agents, mostly farmers, in a Central European model region, and simulate the changes to land-use patterns resulting from their response to three scenarios of changing socio-economic conditions and three scenarios of climate change until the mid of the century. Subsequently, we use species distribution models to, first, analyse relationships between the realized niches of 832 plant species and climatic gradients or land-use types, respectively, and, second, to project consequent changes in potential regional ranges of these species as triggered by changes in both the altered land-use patterns and the changing climate. We find that both drivers determine the realized niches of the studied plants, with land use having a stronger effect than any single climatic variable in the model. Nevertheless, the plants' future distributions appear much more responsive to climate than to land-use changes because alternative future socio-economic backgrounds have only modest impact on land-use decisions in the model region. However, relative effects of climate and land-use changes on biodiversity may differ drastically in other regions, especially where landscapes are still dominated by natural or semi-natural habitat. We conclude that agent-based modelling of land use is able to provide scenarios at scales relevant to individual species distribution and suggest that coupling ABMs with models of species' range change should be intensified to provide more realistic biodiversity forecasts.",,,,"Haberl, Helmut/G-3679-2013; hernandez, andres/AAF-9086-2020","Haberl, Helmut/0000-0003-2104-5446; Dullinger, Iwona/0000-0002-2692-2973; Mayer, Andreas/0000-0002-6975-7082",Austrian Academy of Sciences,Austrian Academy of Sciences,,,0,0,6,6,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, harvesting carnivores creates its own set of conflicts in both society and among conservation professionals, where one consequence is a need to demonstrate that management is sustainable, evidence-based, and guided by science. Furthermore, because large carnivores often also have high degrees of legal protection, harvest quotas have to be carefully justified and constantly adjusted to avoid damaging their conservation status. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to support adaptive management of Eurasian lynx harvesting in Scandinavia. The model uses data from the annual monitoring of lynx abundance and results from long-term field research on lynx biology, which has provided detailed estimates of key demographic parameters. We used the model to predict the probability that the forecasted population size will be below or above the management objectives when subjected to different harvest quotas. The model presented here informs decision makers about the policy risks of alternative harvest levels. Earlier versions of the model have been available for wildlife managers in both Sweden and Norway to guide lynx harvest quotas and the model predictions showed good agreement with observations. We combined monitoring data with data on vital rates and were able to estimate unobserved additional mortality rates, which are most probably due to poaching. In both countries, the past quota setting strategy suggests that there has been a de facto threshold strategy with increasing proportion, which means that there is no harvest below a certain population size, but above this threshold there is an increasing proportion of the population harvested as the population size increases. The annual assessment of the monitoring results, the use of forecasting models, and a threshold harvest approach to quota setting will all reduce the risk of lynx population sizes moving outside the desired goals. The approach we illustrate could be adapted to other populations of mammals worldwide.",,,,,"Broseth, Henrik/0000-0003-3795-891X; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas; Norwegian Environment Directorate; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of Norway [165814, 183176, 212919, 251112]; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research; August T.

The SDM 'ensemble' approach, which combines predictions across different modelling methods, is believed to improve predictive performance, and is used in many recent SDM studies. Here, we aim to compare the predictive performance of ensemble species distribution models to that of individual models, using a large presence-absence dataset of eucalypt tree species. To test model performance, we divided our dataset into calibration and evaluation folds using two spatial blocking strategies (checkerboard-pattern and latitudinal slicing). We calibrated and cross-validated all models within the calibration folds, using both repeated random division of data (a common approach) and spatial blocking. Ensembles were built using the software package 'biomod2', with standard ('untuned') settings. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models were also fitted to the same data, tuned according to published procedures. We then used evaluation folds to compare ensembles against both their component untuned individual models, and against the BRTs. We used area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and log-likelihood for assessing model performance. In all our tests, ensemble models performed well, but not consistently better than their component untuned individual models or tuned BRTs across all tests. Moreover, choosing untuned individual models with best cross-validation performance also yielded good external performance, with blocked cross-validation proving better suited for this choice, in this study, than repeated random cross-validation. The latitudinal slice test was only possible for four species; this showed some individual models, and particularly the tuned one, performing better than ensembles. This study shows no particular benefit to using ensembles over individual tuned models.

Although 70% correct classifications is only slightly better than an uninformative prediction (50%), this classification accuracy can be feasibly improved by increasing monitoring accuracy and frequency. Our findings suggest that models may not need to produce well-constrained predictions before they can inform decisions that improve environmental outcomes.",,,,,"Sisson, Scott/0000-0001-8943-067X; Adams, Matthew Philip/0000-0003-4875-0225; Mengersen, Kerrie/0000-0001-8625-9168; Holloway, Jacinta/0000-0003-4608-5313; Plein, Michaela/0000-0002-7912-2486; Baker, Christopher/0000-0001-9449-3632",University of Queensland's Research Computing Centre (RCC); Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council [LP160100496]; ARC Centre of Excellence in Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council; ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS)Australian Research Council; ACEMS; John Stocker Fellowship from the Science and Industry Endowment Fund; ARCAustralian Research Council [FT170100140],"The corresponding author thanks Brodie A.

Despite worldwide concern about an increased frequency and intensity of such mass occurrences, predicting their booms and busts remains challenging. Forecasting how jellyfish populations may respond to environmental change requires considering their complex life histories. Metagenic life cycles, which include a benthic polyp stage, can boost jellyfish mass occurrences via asexual recruitment of pelagic medusae. Here we present stage-structured matrix population models with monthly, individual-based demographic rates of all life stages of the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita L. (sensu stricto). We investigate the life-stage dynamics of these complex populations under low and high food conditions to illustrate how changes in medusa density depend on non-medusa stage dynamics. We show that increased food availability can be an important ecological driver of jellyfish mass occurrences, as it can temporarily shift the population structure from polyp- to medusa-dominated. Projecting populations for a winter warming scenario additionally enhanced the booms and busts of jellyfish blooms. We identify demographic key variables that control the intensity and frequency of jellyfish blooms in response to environmental drivers such as habitat eutrophication and climate change. By contributing to an improved understanding of mass occurrence phenomena, our findings provide perspective for future management of ecosystem health.",,,,"; Steiner, Ulrich/C-7099-2015","Goldstein, Josephine/0000-0002-5783-0078; Steiner, Ulrich/0000-0002-1778-5989","Max-Planck Society (Max-Planck Odense Center on the Biodemography of Aging, Denmark)","We thank Kim Lundgreen for technical assistance and Daniel A.

Acoustic telemetry has recently emerged as an important methodology for understanding horizontal and vertical space-use patterns in fishes. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to document marine habitat use and depth/temperature preference of 26 anadromous Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus within the Kitikmeot Sea region of the Canadian central Arctic over 4 yr (20132016). Most detections (similar to 70%) were within the top 3 m of the water column, and most were in estuarine (72.6%) vs. marine (27.4%) habitats. Arctic char preferred deeper waters later in the summer, but the temperature they occupied remained relatively constant throughout the marine feeding season (similar to 5-8 degrees C). Most Arctic char exhibited some degree of repetitive diving behavior, with individuals diving to 35 m. Diving activity increased later in the summer marine feeding season and is likely a response to the seasonal transition of their preferred prey to deeper waters as the season progresses. Finally, Arctic char preferred deeper waters with less ice cover and during the day, the latter suggesting potential diel patterns to marine habitat use. Finally, year-to-year variation in Arctic char depth and temperature use was very modest despite differences in climatic and ice conditions. This result suggests that habitat use is relatively fixed and may reflect their thermal and osmoregulatory physiology, which has important implications for forecasting the impacts of a changing Arctic on this economically valuable species.",,,,,"Duke, Patrick/0000-0001-9189-5134","Ekaluktutiak Hunters and Trappers Organization (EHTO); Ocean Tracking Network; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Nunavut Implementation Funds); Nunavut Wildlife Management Board; Polar Knowledge Canada; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction, Response Network; Arctic Net","We are very grateful for the support of the Ekaluktutiak Hunters and Trappers Organization (EHTO) and of the residents of Cambridge Bay, who made this work possible.

We introduce distantia (v1.0.1), an R package providing general toolset to quantify dissimilarity between ecological time-series, independently of their regularity and number of samples. The functions in distantia provide the means to compute dissimilarity scores by time and by shape and assess their significance, evaluate the partial contribution of each variable to dissimilarity, and align or combine sequences by similarity. We evaluate the sensitivity of the dissimilarity metrics implemented in distantia, describe its structure and functionality, and showcase its applications with two examples. Particularly, we evaluate how geographic factors drive the dissimilarity between nine pollen sequences dated to the Last Interglacial, and compare the temporal dynamics of climate and enhanced vegetation index of three stands across the range of the European beech. We expect this package may enhance the capabilities of researchers from different fields to explore dissimilarity patterns between multivariate ecological time-series, and aid in generating and testing new hypotheses on why the temporal dynamics of complex-systems changes over space and time.",,,,"Birks, H.

Forecasting future locations of persistence is key to the conservation of those species. In this study, we had two major objectives: (1) to determine the potential decline in the extent of three montane conifers in California, USA, and (2) to assess how model resolution affected our estimates of decline and whether this could inform identifying potential holdouts. To do so, we forecast forest dynamics, disturbances, and future distributions of three montane conifer species under a changing climate in the Klamath Mountains using the LANDIS-II forest simulation model. Simulations were run under two grain sizes, 0.81 and 7.29 ha cells, and four GCMs representing three relative concentration pathways. The area occupied by the three montane conifers declined by the end of the twenty-first century, with only a few areas where the species were able to persist. Higher levels of climate forcing resulted in greater declines. Moreover, higher temperatures reduced tree regeneration although adult populations persisted despite the climate disequilibrium. Model resolution but did not alter the overall trend of decline. These species were projected to remain in only a few limited areas by the end of the century, but because these species are widely dispersed on the larger landscape, managers must consider trade-offs between local and broader conservation efforts and consider the current and potential range of these conifers throughout the west.",,,,"Scheller, Robert M/B-3135-2009","Scheller, Robert M/0000-0002-7507-4499",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1353509]; National Science Foundation IGERT Grant [0966376]; Microsoft Azure,This material is based upon work supported by National Science Foundation Collaborative Research Grant #1353509 and National Science Foundation IGERT Grant #0966376.

However, resilience of ECMF to future climates is uncertain. We forecast these changes over the extent of North American Pinaceae forests. Location About 68 sites from North American Pinaceae forests ranging from Florida to Ontario in the east and southern California to Alaska in the west. Taxon Ectomycorrhizal fungi (Asco- and Basidiomycetes). Methods We characterized ECMF communities at each site using molecular methods and modelled climatic drivers of diversity and community composition with general additive, generalized dissimilarity models and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN). Next, we projected our models across the extent of North American Pinaceae forests and forecast ECMF responses to climate changes in these forests over the next 50 years. Results We predict median declines in ECMF species richness as high as 26% in Pinaceae forests throughout a climate zone comprising more than 3.5 million square kilometres of North America (an area twice that of Alaska state). Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions can reduce these declines, but not prevent them. The existence of multiple diversity optima along climate gradients suggest regionally divergent trajectories for North American ECMF, which is corroborated by corresponding ECMF community thresholds identified in TITAN models. Warming of forests along the boreal-temperate ecotone results in projected ECMF species loss and declines in the relative abundance of long-distance foraging ECMF species, whereas warming of eastern temperate forests has the opposite effect.

However, models generate great uncertainty when they are used to predict or forecast ecosystem responses to global change. This uncertainty is partly due to parameterization, which is an essential procedure for model specification via defining parameter values for a model. The classic doctrine of parameterization is that a parameter is constant. However, it is commonly known from modeling practice that a model that is well calibrated for its parameters at one site may not simulate well at another site unless its parameters are tuned again. This common practice implies that parameter values have to vary with sites. Indeed, parameter values that are estimated using a statistically rigorous approach, that is, data assimilation, vary with time, space, and treatments in global change experiments. This paper illustrates that varying parameters is to account for both processes at unresolved scales and changing properties of evolving systems. A model, no matter how complex it is, could not represent all the processes of one system at resolved scales. Interactions of processes at unresolved scales with those at resolved scales should be reflected in model parameters. Meanwhile, it is pervasively observed that properties of ecosystems change over time, space, and environmental conditions. Parameters, which represent properties of a system under study, should change as well. Tuning has been practiced for many decades to change parameter values. Yet this activity, unfortunately, did not contribute to our knowledge on model parameterization at all. Data assimilation makes it possible to rigorously estimate parameter values and, consequently, offers an approach to understand which, how, how much, and why parameters vary. To fully understand those issues, extensive research is required. Nonetheless, it is clear that changes in parameter values lead to different model predictions even if the model structure is the same.",,,,,,"U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [4000161830, DE-SC0006982]; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1655499]","U.S. Department of Energy, Grant/Award Number: 4000161830 and DE-SC0006982; U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB 1655499",,,0,0,10,10,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The accumulation and decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) are closely tied to mangroves' carbon sink functions and resistance to rising sea levels. However, few studies have investigated the response of mangrove SOM dynamics to likely future environmental conditions. We quantified how mangrove SOM decay is affected by predicted global warming (+4 degrees C), sea level changes (simulated by altering of the inundation duration to 0, 2, and 6 hr/day), and their interaction. Whilst changes in inundation duration between 2 and 6 hr/day did not affect SOM decay, the treatment without inundation led to a 60% increase. A warming of 4 degrees C caused SOM decay to increase by 21%, but longer inundation moderated this temperature-driven increase. Our results indicate that (a) sea level rise is unlikely to decrease the SOM decay rate, suggesting that previous mangrove elevation gain, which has allowed mangroves to persist in areas of sea level rise, might result from changes in root production and/or mineral sedimentation; (b) sea level fall events, predicted to double in frequency and area, will cause periods of intensified SOM decay; (c) changing tidal regimes in mangroves due to sea level rise might attenuate increases in SOM decay caused by global warming.

Understanding these interactions is thus essential for correctly predicting species' responses to climate change. We focussed on an avian forest guild of four hole-nesting species with differing sensitivities to climate that show a range of well-understood reciprocal interactions, including facilitation, competition and predation. We modelled the potential distributions of black woodpecker and boreal, tawny and Ural owl, and tested whether the spatial patterns of the more widespread species (excluding Ural owl) were shaped by interspecific interactions. We then modelled the potential future distributions of all four species, evaluating how the predicted changes will alter the overlap between the species' ranges, and hence the spatial outcomes of interactions. Forest cover/type and climate were important determinants of habitat suitability for all species. Field data analysed with N-mixture models revealed effects of interspecific interactions on current species abundance, especially in boreal owl (positive effects of black woodpecker, negative effects of tawny owl). Climate change will impact the assemblage both at species and guild levels, as the potential area of range overlap, relevant for species interactions, will change in both proportion and extent in the future. Boreal owl, the most climate-sensitive species in the guild, will retreat, and the range overlap with its main predator, tawny owl, will increase in the remaining suitable area: climate change will thus impact on boreal owl both directly and indirectly. Climate change will cause the geographical alteration or disruption of species interaction networks, with different consequences for the species belonging to the guild and a likely spatial increase of competition and/or intraguild predation.

Why do some traits trade off but others are coexpressed? Why might some trait associations hold across levels of organization, from individuals and genotypes to populations and species, whereas others only occur at one level? Understanding such scaling is a core biological problem, bearing on the evolution of ecological strategies as well as forecasting responses to environmental change. Explicitly considering the hierarchy of biodiversity and expectations at each scale (individual change, evolution within and among populations, and species turnover) is necessary as we work toward a predictive framework in evolutionary ecology. Within species, a trait may have an association with another trait because of phenotypic plasticity, genetic correlation, or population-level local adaptation. Plastic responses are often adaptive and yet individuals have a fixed pool of resources; thus, positive and negative trait associations can be generated by immediate environmental needs and energetic demands. Genetic variation and covariation for traits within a population are typically shaped by varying natural selection in space and time. Although genetic correlations are infrequently long-term constraints, they may indicate competing organismal demands. Traits are often quantitatively differentiated among populations (local adaptation), although selection rarely favors qualitatively different strategies until populations become reproductively isolated. Across species, niche specialization to particular habitats or biotic interactions may determine trait correlations, a subset of which are termed ""strategic trade-offs"" because they are a consequence of adaptive specialization. Across scales, constraints within species often do not apply as new species evolve, and conversely, trait correlations observed across populations or species may not be reflected within populations. I give examples of such scale-dependent trait associations and their causes across taxonomic groups and ecosystems, and in the final section of the paper, I specifically evaluate leaf economics spectrum traits and their associations with plant defense against herbivory. Scale-dependent predictions emerge for understanding plant ecology holistically, and this approach can be fruitfully applied more generally in evolutionary ecology. Adaptive specialization and community context are two of the primary drivers of trade-offs and syndromes across biological scales.",,,,,,National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Science Foundation Division of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.

The work is devoted to identifying the productivity of pasture landscapes in the Volgograd region. The aim was to determine the direction of trends and the values of the coefficients of proportionality which would permit the definition of areas where the productivity of natural zonal vegetation has increased or decreased from 2000 until today. Material and Methods. Pasture productivity assessment is based on the analysis of the NDVI vegetation index, which is widely used in such studies. For analysis, specific pasture areas were identified in accordance with Global Land Cover, divided into regular grids and given overlays corresponding with the boundaries of municipalities and landscapes. Results. The largest areas of natural zonal pastures are located in the Trans-Volga region and on the sandy massifs of the Don River valley. About 60% of pasture land has an average weighted average long-term NDVI value from 0.3 to 0.4, and approximately a quarter - from 0.4 to 0.5. In most parts of the region there are negative NDVI trends. The highest rate of degradation is noted in the Trans-Volga region. This is associated with larger pasturing loads than in the rest of the region, as well as with the regular occurrence of steppe fires. Conclusion. In summation: the productivity trends of zonal pastures in the Volgograd region have been determined, as have areas with different NDVI directions and dynamics. The application of these results in practice should make it possible to predict pasture productivity in various municipal districts and landscapes of the region, and thus assist in the regulation of pasture loads and the mitigation of risks of vegetation degradation.",,,,"Solodovnikov, Denis/R-3234-2019; Shinkarenko, Stanislav S./R-9694-2016","Shinkarenko, Stanislav S./0000-0002-9269-4489",,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,1992-1098,2413-0958,,S RUSS-ECOL DEV,South Russ.-Ecol.

As an example, we discuss the need for effective management of one species, the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri. This species is unique amongst birds in that its breeding habit is critically dependent upon seasonal fast ice. Here, we review its vulnerability to ongoing and projected climate change, given that sea ice is susceptible to changes in winds and temperatures. We consider published projections of future emperor penguin population status in response to changing environments. Furthermore, we evaluate the current IUCN Red List status for the species, and recommend that its status be changed to Vulnerable, based on different modelling projections of population decrease of a 50% over the current century, and the specific traits of the species. We conclude that current conservation measures are inadequate to protect the species under future projected scenarios. Only a reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will reduce threats to the emperor penguin from altered wind regimes, rising temperatures and melting sea ice; until such time, other conservation actions are necessary, including increased spatial protection at breeding sites and foraging locations. The designation of large-scale marine spatial protection across its range would benefit the species, particularly in areas that have a high probability of becoming future climate change refugia. We also recommend that the emperor penguin is listed by the Antarctic Treaty as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species, with development of a species Action Plan.",,,,,,"WWF-UK [GB095701]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPP1744794, 1643901]","We thank Thomas J.

It affects many key processes involved in matter and energy transportation. The associations between mosses and N-2-fixing cyanobacteria influence the balance of N and C in the northern latitudes. It is predicted that climate change will lead to structural and functional rearrangements in the associations between cyanobacteria and bryophytes which will result in increased rates of N. The most widespread bryophyte associations with cyanoprokaryotes are found in bogs. They have an impact on the Earth's climate. In turn, climate change causes significant structural and functional reorganization of bogs ecosystems. The described relationship makes it necessary to do comprehensive analysis of bog ecosystems at expected or observed climatic changes. The obtained data could help to forecast changes in C and N pools. The aim of the investigation was to seasonal observations composition, structure and N-2-fixing activity of cyanobacteria in bryophyte complexes in taiga bogs. We were conduct field and laboratory studies (in May-October 2018) on daily and seasonal N-2-fixing activity (using the acetylene reduction method) which occur in associations between Sphagnum mosses and cyanobacteria in various types of the floodplain bogs. The basis of epiphytic groups on Sphagnum mosses is formed by cyanobacteria N-2-fixing: Nostoc paludosum, Microchaete tenera, Anabaena verrucosa, Hapalosiphon pumilus. The quantitative characteristics of cyanobacteria in the epiphytic groups of Sphagnum mosses from 20 to 350 thousand colonies per dm(2) of moss cover were noted. Seasonal changes in the quantitative indices of cyanobacteria were revealed. The maximum rates of nitrogenase activity were noted for the warmest month (July) in the range 0.78 to 2.12 mg C2H4/(m(2).h). The dependence of the N-2-fixing process on temperature was studied, and on its basis, nitrogen-fixing activity were calculated for the growing period (156 days): 1.28-3.02 g C2H4/m(2), or 1.51-3.50 g N/m(2).",,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,1,,,,1995-4301,2618-8406,,THEOR APPL ECOL,Theor.

Nonlinear dynamics, where a change in the input is not proportional to a change in the output, are often found throughout nature, for example in biochemical kinetics. Because of the complex suite of interacting abiotic and biotic variables present in ecosystems, animal population dynamics are often thought to be driven in a nonlinear, state-dependent fashion. However, so far these have only been identified in model organisms and some natural systems. Here we show that nonlinear population dynamics are ubiquitous in nature. We use nonlinear forecasting to analyse 747 datasets of 228 species to find that insect population trends were highly nonlinear (74%), followed by mammals (58%), bony fish (49%) and birds (35%). This indicates that linear, equilibrium-based model assumptions may fail at predicting population dynamics across a wide range of animal taxa. We show that faster-reproducing animals are more likely to have nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamics, supporting past ecological theory. Lastly, only a third of time series were predictable beyond two years; therefore, the ability to predict animal population trends using these methods may be limited. Our results suggest that the complex dynamics necessary to cause regime shifts and other transitions may be inherent in a wide variety of animals.",,,,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [366280]; Idaho Department of Fish and Game; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1836793],"Funding for this project was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship under grant no. 366280 (T.J.C.), the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (T.J.C.) and NSF grant no. 1836793 (A.D.L.).

As global temperatures rise, periods with elevated fire weather are expected to increase in frequency and duration, which would be expected to increase the number and size of fires. Statistical forecasts or simulations of future fire activity often account for direct climatic effects only, neglecting other controls of importance, such as biotic feedbacks. This could result in overestimating the effects of climate change on fire activity, if the future distribution of vegetation or fuels were to change. We incorporated sensitivity to climate or fire weather and vegetation in a fire simulation model and represented explicitly two key biotic feedbacks linked to succession and regeneration processes. We used this model to forecast annual fire activity from 2011 to 2099 over a large region of boreal forest in Quebec, Canada, dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) or paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), with and without the biotic feedbacks. Our simulations show that vegetation changes triggered by fire disturbance altered future fire activity and may even be as important a driver as climate change itself. Indeed, over the course of the century, vegetation changes were projected to offset much of the increase in fire activity that would be expected due to global warming as such. It follows that if biotic feedbacks are not included in statistical or simulation-based forecasts, the resultant projections of future fire activity could be biased upward to a very considerable degree. For the case of end-of-century mean annual burn rate, we estimated this positive bias to be as high as 400%. Accounting for biotic feedbacks in simulation models is therefore necessary for accurate projection of future wildfire activity and associated vegetation changes. Purely statistical forecasts based on current vegetation cannot be relied upon, in the presence of biotic feedbacks. Our results further suggest that vegetation management could reduce fire risk in some systems by altering the abundance and distribution of the most highly flammable fuels and thus mitigate the impact of climate change on fire activity.",,,,,,Ouranos Consortium; Fonds vert du gouvernement du Quebec; Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants program; Canada Research Chair programCanada Research Chairs,"Financial support came from the Ouranos Consortium, the Fonds vert du gouvernement du Quebec, the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute, the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants program (SGC) and the Canada Research Chair program (SGC and EJBM).

Lamprey play a vital role in river ecosystems and are one of the oldest vertebrates that have persisted over time likely influencing the evolution of many aquatic species. Pacific Lamprey have declined in abundance and are restricted in distribution throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. A key uncertainty influencing Pacific Lamprey status is the impact of climate change. We modified the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to accommodate climate predictions from the International Panel on Climate Change. Using downscaled information, we characterized changes in 15 rivers occupied by Pacific Lamprey in the western U.S. We evaluated this risk under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 for two time periods (mid-century 2040-2069 and end-century 2070-2099). The CCVI scores generally increased when going from RCP 4.5 to RCP 8.5 in three Global Climate Models for both mid-century and end-century, which our analyses forecasts degraded stream temperature and hydrologic conditions under increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The geographically assessed results suggest that climate change impacts to Pacific Lamprey vulnerability are magnified in highly altered rivers. If we continue to observe greenhouse gas emission levels associated with the RCP 8.5, Pacific Lamprey will be at greater risk to climate change impacts. In order to mitigate the risk from climate change toward the end of the century, additional actions will need to be prioritized to rapidly reduce the impact of these threats such as increasing flow, creating backwater habitat, restoring riparian vegetation and reducing stream disturbances.

However, fully customized models require more information for focal species. We focus on pest spread and ask: How much does predictive power differ between generalized and customized models? Further, we examine whether an intermediate ""semi-generalized"" model, combining elements of a general model with species-specific modifications, could yield predictive advantages. We compared predictive power of a generalized model applied to all forest pest species (the generalized dispersal kernel or GDK) to customized spread models for three invasive forest pests (beech bark disease [Cryptococcus fagisuga], gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar], and hemlock woolly adelgid [Adelges tsugae]), for which time-series data exist. We generated semi-generalized dispersal kernel models (SDK) through GDK correction factors based on additional species-specific information. We found that customized models were more predictive than the GDK by an average of 17% for the three species examined, although the GDK still had strong predictive ability (57% spatial variation explained). However, by combining the GDK with simple corrections into the SDK model, we attained a mean of 91% of the spatial variation explained, compared to 74% for the customized models. This is, to our knowledge, the first comparison of general and species-specific ecological spread models' predictive abilities. Our strong predictive results suggest that general models can be effectively synthesized with context-specific information for single species to respond quickly to invasions.

Incubations of Chukchi Sea bottom water microbiomes showed similar, but delayed functional responses to identical treatments. Although 24 functional terms were shared between experimental treatments, the timing, and degree of the remaining responses were highly variable, showing that organic matter perturbation directs community functionality prior to alterations to the taxonomic distribution at the microbiome class level. The dynamic responses of these two oceanic microbial communities have important implications for timing and magnitude of responses to organic perturbations within the Arctic Ocean and how community-level functions may forecast biogeochemical gradients in oceans.",,,,,"Mikan, Molly/0000-0002-5923-9863; Noble, William/0000-0001-7283-4715; Nunn, Brook/0000-0002-7361-4359; Salter, Ian/0000-0002-4513-0314; Harvey, Rodger/0000-0001-7746-7758; May, Damon/0000-0001-6902-3153; Riffle, Michael/0000-0003-1633-8607","US Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Alaska Outer Continental Shelf Region, Anchorage under BOEM as part of the Chukchi Sea Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA) [M11AC00007]; Chemical Oceanography program of the National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [OCE 1633939, OCE 1233589, OCE 1636045]; University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington [UWPR95794]","We would like to thank Lee Cooper for sharing HLY1301 Hanna Shoal project data (http://arcticstudies.org/hannashoa l/data.html).

These distributions interact with the birds' innate program during migration and are critical to successful migration. Hence, favourable environmental conditions for migration consequently lead to spatio-temporal concentrations, and the evolution of specific migratory flyways. Based on the aerodynamic properties of the ten most abundant nocturnal long-distance migrants, we developed a computational framework to simulate millions of individual trajectories across Europe using an agent-based simulation approach. We simulated a three-week period of autumn migration with a temporal resolution of 30 s. Departure conditions were derived from bird densities observed within the first two hours after sunset, which were extracted from the weather radar network. Individual itineraries were strongly influenced by the behavioural reactions to the environment such as the wind flow, coastlines and mountain ranges. Wind speed and direction are among the key factors that shape migration patterns such as reverse movements observed within some nights. Accumulation of migration was triggered by the combined effect of geographic barriers (coastlines, mountain ranges) and wind. The overall result of the simulation corresponds well with the large-scale pattern of bird migration intensities measured across the study area, for instance the high migration intensity observed between the Atlantic coast and the Pyrenees. Our model framework conjoins all important domains, such as the birds' preconditions and behavioural scope, as well as the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment. However, for the time being we cannot decide whether local discrepancies between model and data are due to environmental effects that are not yet captured by our simulation (i.e. effect of rain on migration intensity), or caused by differences in the sensitivity of the local ,weather, radar . systems. Due to the limited time period and lack of more accurate data for validation, our findings are preliminary. Further progress in data quality and - hopefully better access of bird profiles from the continent-wide weather radar network will allow to improve model performance and implement a bird migration forecasting similar to weather forecasts. Apart from assessing conflicts between human activities and bird movements, this would greatly enhance our understanding of biomass flow on a large scale.",,,,,,Swiss National Science Foundation SNFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [205320_179053]; European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) through Action [ES1305],This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation SNF grant #205320_179053.

Assuming that the height of trees correlates with their age made it possible to reconstruct the dynamics of cropland abandonment in the roughly 30-year period preceding the date of the measurements. The variability of forest cover growth over time can be represented by a curve similar in shape to a Gaussian function or a curve resulting from overlapping two or more individual curves shifted in time.

Here we determine the geographical distribution and the variables correlated with the phylogenetic component of diversity and endemism for primates, as well as their relationships with the taxonomic component of diversity. Location New World. Taxon New World monkeys, Platyrrhini. Methods We mapped primate occurrence in cells of 110 x 110 km. For each cell, we calculated phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism (PE), as well as how much these indices deviate from their expected values based on species richness (SR) and endemism (SE), respectively. Using simultaneous autoregressive models, we tested the effects of mean annual temperature, forest structure and climate history on the current patterns of primate phylogenetic diversity. Results We found that most primate phylogenetic diversity is found in the tropical forests of South America. Tropical forests also present much higher PD and PE than predicted by SR and SE, respectively, demonstrating their importance in producing and maintaining primate phylogenetic diversity in the New World. Furthermore, regions presenting low SR and SE nevertheless show high PE, likely because these areas have witnessed the evolution of many clades occurring exclusively therein. Overall, mean annual temperature had the highest influence in explaining phylogenetic indices. Main conclusions Our results suggest a strong influence of primate biogeography throughout the New World on the geographical distribution of the phylogenetic component of their diversity, with the Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Central America containing the greatest amount and endemism of phylogenetic diversity. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics underlying the geographical distribution of New World's primate diversity, especially in a phylogenetic context in which their biogeographical history has deeply affected current patterns of primate diversity in this region. Our results provide essential information for the conservation of primate evolutionary history, especially considering the forecast effects of habitat loss and climate change on the dynamics of tropical forests.",,,,"Varzinczak, Luiz Henrique/K-2305-2016; Moura, Mauricio/B-1063-2013","Varzinczak, Luiz Henrique/0000-0002-2848-4102; Moura, Mauricio/0000-0001-7948-2986","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; National Council for Scientific and Technological DevelopmentNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [309154/2014-6, 307303/2017-9]","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Grant/Award Number: 309154/2014-6 and 307303/2017-9",,,0,0,7,7,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

To reduce these negative impacts on wildlife, forecasts of high migration intensities are needed to apply mitigation actions. While existing weather radar networks offer a unique possibility to monitor and forecast bird migration at large spatial scales, forecasts at the fine spatial scale within a complex terrain, such as the mountainous Swiss landscape, require a small-scale network of ornithological radars. Before attempting to build such a network, it is crucial to first investigate the consistency of the migratory flow across space and time. In this study, we simultaneously operated three ornithological radar systems across the Swiss lowlands to assess the spatio-temporal consistency of diurnal and nocturnal bird movements during the spring and autumn migration season. The relative temporal course of migration intensities was generally consistent between sites during peak migration, in particular for nocturnal movements in autumn, but absolute intensities differed greatly between sites. Outside peak migration, bird movement patterns were much less consistent and, unexpectedly, some presumably non-migratory bird activity achieved intensities close to peak migration intensities, but without spatial correlations. Only nocturnal migration intensity in autumn could be predicted with consistently high accuracy, but including parameters of atmospheric conditions in the model improved predictability of diurnal movements considerably. Predictions for spring were less reliable, probably because we missed an important part of the migration season. Our results show that reliable forecasts of bird movements within a complex terrain call for a network of year-round bird monitoring systems, whereas accurate information of atmospheric conditions can help to limit the number of measurement points.",,,,"Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020","Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Liechti, Felix/0000-0001-9473-0837; Shi, Xu/0000-0001-7009-9120; Tschanz, Philippe/0000-0001-7260-5154; Schmid, Baptiste/0000-0002-7736-7527",,,,,0,0,4,4,,,,,2056-3485,,REMOTE SENS ECOL CON,Remote Sens.

Here, we model observed trajectories through IUCN Red List extinction risk categories for all bird species globally over 28 years, and estimate an overall effective extinction rate of 2.17 x 10(-4)/species/year. This is six times higher than the rate of outright extinction since 1500, as a consequence of the large number of species whose status is deteriorating. We very conservatively estimate that global conservation efforts have reduced the effective extinction rate by 40%, but mostly through preventing critically endangered species from going extinct rather than by preventing species at low risk from moving into higher-risk categories.

Recently developed joint species distribution models can deal with numerous species efficiently, while explicitly accounting for spatial structure in the data. However, their applicability is generally limited to relatively small spatial data sets because of their severe computational scaling as the number of spatial locations increases. In this work, we propose a practical alleviation of this scalability constraint for joint species modeling by exploiting two spatial-statistics techniques that facilitate the analysis of large spatial data sets: Gaussian predictive process and nearest-neighbor Gaussian process. We devised an efficient Gibbs posterior sampling algorithm for Bayesian model fitting that allows us to analyze community data sets consisting of hundreds of species sampled from up to hundreds of thousands of spatial units. The performance of these methods is demonstrated using an extensive plant data set of 30,955 spatial units as a case study.

However, the main drivers of plant species diversity in montane forests are still not clear. In addition, most existing studies make no distinction between direct and indirect effects of environmental factors and spatial constraints on plant biodiversity. Using data from 107 montane forest plots in Sichuan Giant Panda habitat, China, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of abiotic environmental factors, spatial constraints, and plant functional traits on plant community diversity. Our results showed significant correlations between abiotic environmental factors and trees (r = .10, p value = .001), shrubs (r = .19, p value = .001), or overall plant diversity (r = .18, p value = .001) in montane forests. Spatial constraints also showed significant correlations with trees and shrubs. However, no significant correlations were found between functional traits and plant community diversity. Moreover, the diversity (richness and abundance) of shrubs, trees, and plant communities was directly affected by precipitation, latitude, and altitude. Mean annual temperature (MAT) had no direct effect on the richness of tree and plant communities. Further, MAT and precipitation indirectly affected plant communities via the tree canopy. The results revealed a stronger direct effect on montane plant diversity than indirect effect, suggesting that single-species models may be adequate for forecasting the impacts of climate factors in these communities. The shifting of tree canopy coverage might be a potential indicator for trends of plant diversity under climate change.",,,,"Xiong, Qinli/Y-7212-2018","Xiong, Qinli/0000-0003-3827-3437","Demonstration of Monitoring and Protection of Important Species Habitat [2016YFC0503305]; Key Technology and Demonstration for Biodiversity Conservation in Giant Panda National Park [2018SZDX0036]; Biodiversity Survey and Assessment Project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China [2019HJ2096001006]; Sichuan Provincial Land and Resource Department ""8.8"" Major Scientific and Technological Support Research Project on Ecological Geological Disaster Prevention in Earthquake Areas of Jiuzhaigou [KJ-2018-20]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31700544]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Light of West China Program [2016XBZG_XBQNXZ_B_005]; CAS Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization & Ecological Restoration Biodiversity Conservation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province Program [kxysws1901]","Demonstration of Monitoring and Protection of Important Species Habitat, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0503305; Key Technology and Demonstration for Biodiversity Conservation in Giant Panda National Park, Grant/Award Number: 2018SZDX0036; the Biodiversity Survey and Assessment Project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China, Grant/Award Number: 2019HJ2096001006; Sichuan Provincial Land and Resource Department ""8.8"" Major Scientific and Technological Support Research Project on Ecological Geological Disaster Prevention in Earthquake Areas of Jiuzhaigou, Grant/Award Number: KJ-2018-20; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31700544; the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Light of West China Program, Grant/Award Number: 2016XBZG_XBQNXZ_B_005; CAS Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization & Ecological Restoration Biodiversity Conservation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province Program, Grant/Award Number: kxysws1901",,,0,0,18,18,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Forecasts from conventional population viability analysis (PVA) are made using a two-step procedure in which parameters are estimated, or elicited from expert opinion, and then plugged into a stochastic population model without accounting for parameter uncertainty. Recently developed statistical PVAs differ because forecasts are made conditional on models fitted to empirical data. The statistical forecasting approach allows for uncertainty about parameters, but it has rarely been applied in metapopulation contexts where spatially explicit inference is needed about colonization and extinction dynamics and other forms of stochasticity that influence metapopulation viability. We conducted a statistical metapopulation viability analysis (MPVA) using 11 yr of data on the federally threatened Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis) to forecast responses to landscape heterogeneity, drought, environmental stochasticity, and management. We evaluated several future environmental scenarios and pond restoration options designed to reduce extinction risk. Forecasts over a 50-yr time horizon indicated that metapopulation extinction risk was <4% for all scenarios, but uncertainty was high. Without pond restoration, extinction risk is forecasted to be 3.9% (95% CI 0-37%) by year 2066. Restoring six ponds by increasing their hydroperiod reduced extinction risk to <1% and greatly reduced uncertainty (95% CI 0-2%). Our results suggest that managers can mitigate the impacts of drought and environmental stochasticity on metapopulation viability by maintaining ponds that hold water throughout the year and keeping them free of invasive predators.

When forecasting population abundances, studies have shown that simple statistical models often have better forecast performance than complex models. These studies have evaluated forecasts of models fitted separately to data from single sites (single-site approach). Here, we aim to contrast the forecast performance and forecast horizon between a single-site approach and a hierarchical multi-site approach where a single model is fitted to data from multiple-sites, and to investigate how they vary with model complexity. We used 5273 population time series on 84 species from the Swedish breeding bird survey program, and found that simple models on average had better forecast performance and forecast horizon than complex models for both the single- and the multi-site approach. However, the cost of complexity was considerably reduced under the multi-site approach, while the proportion of species for which complex models had better forecast performance than simple models was also much larger than under the single-site approach. This suggests that the multi-site approach is useful for inclusion of more detailed processes which may benefit forecasts for some species and which are of importance for managers.

Species distribution models (also known as niche models) predict where on the landscape there is suitable habitat for a species of interest. Correlative niche modeling, the most commonly employed approach to predict species' distributions, relies on correlations between species' localities and current environmental data. This type of model could spuriously forecast less future suitable habitat because species' current distributions may not adequately represent their thermal tolerance, and future climate conditions may not be analogous to current conditions. We compared the predicted distributions for three montane species of Plethodon salamanders in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North America using a correlative modeling approach and a mechanistic model. The mechanistic model incorporates species-specific physiology, morphology and behavior to predict an annual energy budget on the landscape. Both modeling approaches performed well at predicting the species' current distributions and predicted that all species could persist in habitats at higher elevation through 2085. The mechanistic model predicted more future suitable habitat than the correlative model. We attribute these differences to the mechanistic approach being able to model shifts in key range-limiting biological processes (changes in surface activity time and energy costs) that the correlative approach cannot. Choice of global circulation model (GCM) contributed significantly to distribution predictions, with a tenfold difference in future suitability based on GCM, indicating that GCM variability should be either directly included in models of species distributions or, indirectly, through the use of multi-model ensemble averages.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how nitrogen (N) enrichment influences carbon (C) allocation across plant functional processes and tree organs in individual trees remains elusive. Location Global forest ecosystems. Time period 1990-2018. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods We compiled data from 75 N addition experiments and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the responses of C source (photosynthesis), sinks (growth and respiration) and storage (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations) in different tree organs (foliage, above-ground wood and roots) to N enrichment. Results N enrichment significantly enhanced C supply via photosynthesis (+39.6%, n = 128). C allocation to growth (biomass increment/production) significantly increased in foliage (+15.9%, n = 68) and above-ground wood (+31.8%, n = 64; bole, branch, stem and/or twig) with increasing N availability, but not in roots, whereas allocation increased in roots via increasing fine root turnover rate (+22.6%, n = 11). N fertilization significantly increased C allocation to respiration in above-ground wood (+46.6%, n = 12) and roots (+5.5%, n = 57), but not in foliage. N addition decreased non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in foliage (-5.4%, n = 16) and roots (-5.0%, n = 21), but increased NSC in above-ground wood (+6.1%, n = 22). In addition, N enrichment effects were strongly affected by moderator variables. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that N addition increased C allocation to growth and respiration more strongly than C allocation to NSC storage, and increased C allocation to above-ground parts more strongly than to below-ground parts. Our results are useful for better understanding the response of tree functional processes at organ level to N enrichment. The existing data also reveal that more long-term experimental studies on mature trees in tropical and boreal forests are urgently needed to provide a basis for forecasting tree responses to N enrichment at the global scale.",,,,,"Li, Weibin/0000-0001-8970-0318","Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiment-Tropics, US-DOE; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2018-3]","the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiment-Tropics, Grant/Award Number: US-DOE; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: lzujbky-2018-3",,,0,0,62,62,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Bitumen mining in the Alberta oil sands region of western Canada requires reclamation to ""equivalent land capability,"" implying establishment of vegetation similar to undisturbed boreal ecosystems. However, there is consensus that this region will be exposed to relatively severe climate warming, causing increased occurrence of drought and wildfire, which threaten the persistence of both natural and reclaimed ecosystems. We used a landscape model, LANDIS-II, to simulate plant responses to climate change and disturbances, forecasting changes to boreal forests within the oil sands region. Under the most severe climate forcing scenarios (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5) the model projected substantial decreases in forest biomass, with the future forest being dominated by drought- and fire-tolerant species characteristic of parkland or prairie ecosystems. In contrast, less extreme climate forcing scenarios (RCPs 2.6 and 4.5) had relatively minor effects on forest composition and biomass with boreal conifers continuing to dominate the landscape. If the climate continues to change along a trajectory similar to those simulated by climate models for the RCP 8.5 forcing scenario, current reclamation goals to reestablish spruce-dominated boreal forest will likely be difficult to achieve.

A natural 200-year-old pine stand belonging to the grassy pine forest with oak type was studied. The following analyses have been performed: a mathematical analysis of the strength and frequency of the relationship between the monthly precipitation amounts and average monthly air temperatures (based on the data of Voronezh and Voronezh Nature Reserve meteorological stations), as well as radial increments of the Scots pine throughout the period of 80 years. It was established that the sums of precipitation in April and especially in May have the maximum effect on the radial increment of Scots pine (spring wood). The precipitation in July-August significantly affects the late wood growth. A strong correlation between the radial increment and September and especially October temperatures of the current year (r = 0.43) and the previous year (r = 0.40) was identified. In addition, a negative correlation between the radial increment and summer temperatures was established. The correlation ratio of the relationship between the meteorological factors and radial increment was considerably higher than the correlation index, which confirms the nonlinear nature of this relationship. Based on the cyclical dynamics of the radial increment of Scots pine (11- and 34-year cycles), models have been built using two forecasting methods (Caterpillar Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and an additive increment model described by a sinusoid function with a given period), and an increment forecast for the 10-year period was produced. According to the models, the radial increment is going to decrease in 2018-2019, increase in 2021 +/- 1, and decrease again in 2024 +/- 2.",,,,,,Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-17-00171],"This study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project no. 14-17-00171 (Regional Responses of Environmental Components to Climate Changes of Varying Periodicity: Southern Forest-Steppe of the Central Russian Upland).",,,0,0,0,0,,,,1995-4255,1995-4263,,CONTEMP PROBL ECOL+,Contemp.

We leveraged a dataset of chemical analytical toxin measurements in coastal Maine to demonstrate a new machine learning approach for high-resolution forecasting of paralytic shellfish toxin accumulation. The forecast used a deep learning neural network to provide weekly site-specific forecasts of toxicity levels. The algorithm was trained on images constructed from a chemical fingerprint at each site composed of a series of toxic compound measurements. Under various forecasting configurations, the forecast had high accuracy, generally >95%, and successfully predicted the onset and end of nearly all closure-level toxic events at the site scale at a one-week forecast time.

At long timescales (for example, centuries), the extent of inundation and saltwater exposure will increase; however, on a decadal timescale, the role of these drivers may differ in both magnitude and direction. To investigate the drivers of decadal-scale vegetation change, we measured the changes in five metrics of vegetation composition and structure between 2003/2004 and 2016/2017 at 98 plots distributed across a vegetation gradient from coastal forest to brackish marshes (< 0.5-18 ppt). We used elevation as a proxy of inundation vulnerability and soil sodium concentration as a proxy of saltwater exposure, and we investigated relationships between these two variables and the change in vegetation conditions between the two sampling periods. Soil sodium concentration was a significant predictor of vegetation change for all five vegetation metrics, whereas the effect of elevation was not significant for any of the metrics. The one site that was affected by wildfire twice during the duration of the study shifted almost completely from forest to marsh with limited regeneration of woody vegetation observed in 2016/2017. Our results show that salinization in our system is a more important driver of vegetation change than inundation potential. Furthermore, the effects of drought-induced salinization could be amplified by the elevated risk of wildfire during droughts.

For example, protected areas (PM) are the main strategy to conserve biodiversity, but there is a widespread bias in their location towards unproductive and inaccessible lands. Thus, investments on PM are likely to have been allocated to areas that did not need protection, at least in the short term, creating communication noise to the society. Here, we estimate the likely conservation impact of the recently established (2002-2012) PM and indigenous lands (ILs) in a future scenario of land use projected to 2050. We selected areas that were similar to the PAs/ILs with positive conservation impact to propose spatial priorities aiming to minimize loss of Cerrado vegetation in the future. In our analyses, PM in general and those of strict protection had significantly lower conversion rates than control areas, while sustainable use PM and ILs showed no difference between control and protected areas. We did not find differences in impact values between PAs and ILs, but impact values were higher for strict protection than for sustainable use areas. We found a high density of potential priority areas to maximize impact in northern Cerrado. This region is the next agricultural frontier in the biome, having extensive vegetation cover that can be legally converted according to national legislation. By pinpointing conservation priorities based on impact, we can improve the benefit from land protection and increase the space of interactions between science, policymaking and society at large.",,,,"Bini, Luis Mauricio/D-5865-2013","Bini, Luis Mauricio/0000-0003-3398-9399","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [306694/2018-2, 304314/2014-5, 152172/2016-5, 381106/2017-9]; Programa Nacional de Pos-Doutorado from Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (PNPD/CAPES)CAPES [88882.306081/2018-1]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; MCTIC/CNPq [465610/2014-5]; FAPEG [201810267000023]","This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) Finance Code 001.

However, multiple methodological choices are required during the modelling process, some of which may have a large impact on forecasting results. In this context, virtual species, i.e. the use of simulations involving a fictitious species for which we have perfect knowledge of its occurrence-environment relationships and other relevant characteristics, have become increasingly popular to test SDMs. This approach provides for a simple virtual ecologist framework under which to test model properties, as well as the effects of the different methodological choices, and allows teasing out the effects of targeted factors with great certainty. This simplification is therefore very useful in setting up modelling standards and best practice principles. As a result, numerous virtual species studies have been published over the last decade. The topics covered include differences in performance between statistical models, effects of sample size, choice of threshold values, methods to generate pseudo-absences for presence-only data, among many others. These simulations have therefore already made a great contribution to setting best modelling practices in SDMs. Recent software developments have greatly facilitated the simulation of virtual species, with at least three different packages published to that effect. However, the simulation procedure has not been homogeneous, which introduces some subtleties in the interpretation of results, as well as differences across simulation packages. Here we 1) review the main contributions of the virtual species approach in the SDM literature; 2) compare the major virtual species simulation approaches and software packages; and 3) propose a set of recommendations for best simulation practices in future virtual species studies in the context of SDMs.",,,,"Meynard, Christine N/B-2082-2010; Leroy, Boris/G-4076-2013","Meynard, Christine N/0000-0002-5983-6289; Leroy, Boris/0000-0002-7686-4302",,,,,7,7,11,11,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2019,42,12,,,SI,,2021,2036,,10.1111/ecog.04385,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000501362200004,,,,,

Identifying environmental conditions that drive variation in seed and seedling mortality across similar restoration efforts could increase understanding of when and where restoration outcomes are likely to be favourable and identify new tools and strategies to improve outcomes. We asked how variation in a suite of environmental predictors influenced germination, emergence, seedling establishment and juvenile survival of four commonly sown perennial grass species across 33 seeding experiments distributed over an ~160,000-km(2) area of the Great Basin, a cold desert system in the western United States. Across experiments, we observed wide variation in the rates of four demographic transitions and wide variation in environmental conditions experienced by plants at each stage. For all species, higher precipitation during the first 30 days following seeding was associated with an increase in germination. Conversely, higher soil temperature over this same time period was associated with a significant decrease in germination and emergence, and soil temperature was associated with a substantial portion of the variation in germination and emergence probabilities observed across our seeding experiments. Within the range of precipitation variation observed, we were unable to detect a significant relationship between seedling establishment the first growing season and cumulative precipitation the first year, precipitation during the first spring growing season or annual climatic water deficit (CWD) the first year. Higher CWD the second growing season reduced seedling survival over that time period. Synthesis and applications. Our results show higher soil temperature negatively impacts grass seedling establishment. Restoration efforts should be prioritized when seasonal or subseasonal temperature forecasts indicate likely periods of below average temperatures. These results also indicate that climate warming will make restoration even more difficult, with our model estimates suggesting the 2 degrees C increase in temperature expected in the Great Basin over the coming decades will decrease germination and emergence by about 30%. Lastly, while our field-based approach provided insight into short-term drivers of mortality, it did not provide insight into drivers of longer term survival, suggesting a need for further work on predicting long-term restoration outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,2,2,21,21,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In order to maximise N use efficiency (NUE), growers attempt to match N fertiliser to seasonal water limited yield potential, which in the southern grain growing region is largely determined by in-crop rainfall. Australia's variable rainfall makes water limited yield potential very difficult to predict, and growers tend to under fertilise, fearing economic and environmental losses of N if crops are over-fertilised. However, environmental losses of excess N are low in the semi-arid, winter dominant rainfall environments with high water holding capacity soils that comprise much of the wheat producing regions of south eastern Australia. This is particularly the case when high carbon (C) to N ratio crop residues are retained which facilitate rapid immobilisation of any mineral N surplus to crop requirements. We therefore propose that the exploitable yield gap in wheat could be closed if a longer-term strategy of N fertiliser application was adopted. In this strategy, growers would simply use N fertiliser to maintain an environmentally appropriate base level of inorganic N (N bank) rather than attempting to match fertiliser inputs to seasonal conditions. We used field studies with N-15 labelled fertiliser and cropping systems simulations to demonstrate that fertiliser N applied at rates calculated to maintain fixed thresholds of inorganic N (N bank criteria) and top-dressed immediately prior to the period of rapid crop uptake can substantially increase yields and profit in comparison to current practice, even when applications exceed crop demand in some years. A further benefit of this strategy is an increase in soil organic matter. Both field and simulation studies indicate that the environmental cost of such a strategy would be minimal, with only a small increase in leaching and denitrification despite higher overall rates of N application. This strategy needs to be compared with current practices in longer term field experiments to confirm production increases and lack of environmental impacts.",,,,"Macdonald, Ben/G-1078-2012; Zhao, Zhigan/E-8963-2015","Zhao, Zhigan/0000-0003-1533-7215",CSIRO AgricultureCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australia China Joint Research Centre - Healthy Soils for Sustainable Food Production and Environmental Quality [ACSRF48165]; CSIRO through the research project 'Scientific benchmarks for sustainable agricultural intensification'; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) through the research project 'Scientific benchmarks for sustainable agricultural intensification',"We acknowledge the support from CSIRO Agriculture, the Australia China Joint Research Centre - Healthy Soils for Sustainable Food Production and Environmental Quality (ACSRF48165), and the CSIRO and Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) through the research project 'Scientific benchmarks for sustainable agricultural intensification' for their financial supports.",,,1,1,10,10,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

As a consequence, wild ungulates are occupying rapidly the empty niche left by domestic ungulates. Both types of ungulates represent the main trophic resource for large vertebrate scavengers. However, a comparison of how vertebrate scavengers consume ungulate carcasses in different habitats with different ungulate species composition is lacking. This knowledge is essential to forecast the possible consequences of the current farmland abandonment on scavenger species. Here, we compared the scavenging patterns of 24 wild and 24 domestic ungulate carcasses in a mountainous region of southern Spain monitored through camera trapping. Our results show that carcasses of domestic ungulates, which concentrate in large numbers in open pasturelands, were detected and consumed earlier than those of wild ungulate carcasses, which frequently occur in much lower densities at more heterogenous habitats such as shrublands and forest. Richness and abundance of scavengers were also higher at domestic ungulate carcasses in open habitats. Vultures, mainly griffons (Gyps fulvus), consumed most of the carcasses, although mammalian facultative scavengers, mainly wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), also contributed importantly to the consumption of wild ungulate carcasses in areas with higher vegetation cover. Our findings evidence that the abandonment of traditional grazing may entail consequences for the scavenger community, which should be considered by ecologists and wildlife managers.

However, metrics for communicating its impacts typically overlook the nonthreatened component of assemblages. This risks the loss of habitat going unreported for species that comprise the majority of assemblages. We adapted a widely used measure for summarizing researcher output (the h index) to provide a metric that describes natural habitat loss for entire assemblages, inclusive of threatened and nonthreatened species. For each of 447 Australian native terrestrial bird species, we combined information on their association with broad vegetation groups with distributional range maps to identify the difference between the estimated pre-European and current extents of potential habitat, defined as vegetation groups most closely associated with each species. From this, we calculated the loss index (LI), which revealed that 30% of native birds have each lost at least 30% of their potential natural habitat (LI = 30). At the subcontinental scale, LIs ranged from 15 in arid Australia to 61 in the highly transformed southeastern part of the country. Different subcomponents of the assemblage had different LI values. For example, Australia's parrots (n = 52 species) had an LI of 38, whereas raptors (n = 32 species) had an LI of 25. The LI is simple to calculate and can be determined using readily available spatial information on species distributions, native vegetation associations, and human impacts on natural land cover. This metric, including the curves used to deduce it, could complement other biodiversity indices if it is used for regional and global biodiversity assessments that compare the status of natural habitat extent for assemblages within and among nations, monitor changes through time, and forecast future changes to guide strategic land-use planning. The LI is an intuitive tool that can be used to summarize and communicate how human actions affect whole assemblages, not just threatened species. Una Medida Compuesta de la Perdida del Habitat para Ensamblajes Enteros de Especies La destruccion del habitat esta entre las principales amenazas para la biodiversidad, ademas de que afecta tanto a especies comunes como a las especies amenazadas. Sin embargo, las medidas para comunicar los impactos de esta destruccion generalmente ignoran al componente no amenazado de los ensamblajes de especies. Esto genera el riesgo de que la perdida del habitat pase desapercibida en el caso de las especies que conforman a la mayoria de los ensamblajes. Adaptamos una medida de uso amplio para resumir las contribuciones de los investigadores (el indice h) y asi proporcionar una medida que describa la perdida del habitat para ensamblajes enteros, incluyendo a las especies amenazadas y a las no amenazadas. Para cada una de las 447 especies de aves terrestres nativas a Australia, combinamos la informacion sobre su asociacion con grupos generales de vegetacion con mapas de extension de su distribucion para identificar la diferencia entre la extension estimada previa a la llegada de los europeos y la extension actual de los habitats potenciales, definidos como los grupos de vegetacion asociados mas cercanamente con cada especie. A partir de esto, calculamos el indice de perdida (LI, en ingles), el cual revelo que el 30% de cada una de las aves nativas ha perdido al menos el 30% de su habitat natural potencial (LI = 30). A escala subcontinental, los LI variaron desde 15 para las partes aridas de Australia, hasta 61 en la altamente transformada parte sureste del pais. Los diferentes subcomponentes del ensamblaje tuvieron diferentes valores de LI. Por ejemplo, los loros australianos (n = 52 especies) tuvieron un LI de 38, mientras que las aves rapaces (n = 32 especies) tuvieron un LI de 25. El LI es facil de calcular y puede determinarse usando informacion espacial que ya se encuentra disponible, las asociaciones con la vegetacion nativa y los impactos humanos sobre la cobertura natural del suelo. Esta medida, incluyendo las curvas que se usan para deducirla, podrian complementar otros indices de biodiversidad si se usa para evaluaciones de la biodiversidad regional y global, las cuales comparan el estado de la extension del habitat natural para ensamblajes dentro y entre las naciones, monitorean cambios a traves del tiempo y pronostican cambios futuros que guien la planeacion del uso de suelo estrategico. El LI es una herramienta intuitiva que puede usarse para resumir y comunicar como las acciones humanas afectan a ensamblajes enteros, no solo a las especies amenazadas.

The majority of amphibian invasions are due to the pet trade pathway and current lists of extra-limital amphibians suggest that future invasions will encompass a broader taxonomic diversity than is known. Given that trade is dynamic, it is essential to move beyond currently traded species and understand which species are likely to be traded in the future and serve as candidates for invasions. In this study, we systematically assess amphibian species in the pet trade, (i) characterising taxonomic bias, (ii) evaluating species-traits as predictors of traded species and trade volume, and (iii) forecasting likely future pets. We collated a global list of 443 traded amphibians and a regional dataset (USA) on trade volume. Species-traits (body size, native range size, clutch size, and breeding type) and conservation status, were considered as predictors of traded species and volume. Six Families contributed disproportionately to the amphibian pet trade; the likelihood for species to be traded was positively associated with body size, range size, and a 'larval' breeding type. However, species-traits performed poorly in predicting trade volume, suggesting an overriding effect of socio-economic aspects of the trade. The identified species-traits and taxonomic bias of the trade were then used to predict species likely to be traded as pets in the future. This study formalizes the knowledge on amphibian species that are traded as pets. We found a strong bias for certain Families, along with a preference for large-bodied and widely distributed species with a larval phase. Our results pave way for more trait-based approaches to forecast amphibians entering the trade. Such understanding of the pet trade can help pre-emptively tackle the pathway responsible for most invasions and disease spread in amphibians.",,,,"Measey, John/F-2028-2010","Measey, John/0000-0001-9939-7615; Mohanty, Nitya Prakash/0000-0001-7768-6483",,,,,0,0,22,22,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Species are expected to shift their ranges as a response to climate change, with relevant implications to peripheral populations at the trailing and leading edges. Several studies have analyzed the exposure of species to climate change but few have explored exposure at the intraspecific level. We introduce a framework to forecast exposure to climate change at the intraspecific level. We build on existing methods by combining correlative species distribution models, a model of species range dynamics, and a model of phylogeographic interpolation. We demonstrate the framework by applying it to 20 Iberian amphibian and reptile species. Our aims were to: (a) identify which species and intraspecific lineages will be most exposed to future climate change; (b) test if nucleotide diversity at the edges of species ranges are significantly higher or lower than on the overall range; and (c) analyze if areas of higher species gain, loss, and turnover coincide with those predicted for lineages richness and nucleotide diversity. We found that about 80% of the studied species are predicted to contract their range. Within each species, some lineages were predicted to contract their range, while others were predicted to maintain or expand it. Therefore, estimating the impacts of climate change at the species level only can underestimate losses at the intraspecific level. Some species had significant high amount of nucleotide at the trailing or leading edge, or both, but we did not find a consistent pattern across species. Spatial patterns of species richness, gain, loss, and turnover were fairly concurrent with lineages richness and nucleotide diversity. Our results support the need for increased attention to intraspecific diversity regarding monitoring and conservation strategies under climate change.",,,,"Carvalho, Silvia/AAE-9566-2020; Torres, Joao/AAJ-7774-2020; Velo-Anton, Guillermo/I-7694-2013","Carvalho, Silvia/0000-0003-4368-4708; Torres, Joao/0000-0003-0605-3739; Velo-Anton, Guillermo/0000-0002-9483-5695","European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU) [PTDC/BIA-BIC/3545/2014]; Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme [NORTE 2020]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [ICETA/EEC2018/16, CEECIND/01464/2017, IF/01425/2014]",,,,1,1,34,35,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The predicted lengthening of the growing season under warming conditions is expected to increase tree growth rates. However, there is evidence of an increasing sensitivity of the boreal forest to drought stress. To assess the influence of temperature and precipitation on the growth of black spruce (Picea mariana), we investigated long-term series of wood anatomical traits on 20 trees from four sites along 600 km, the latitudinal range of the closed boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We correlated the anatomical traits resolved at intraring level with daily temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation during the 1943-2010 period. Tree-ring width, number of cells per ring and cell wall thickness were positively affected by spring and summer daily mean and maximum temperature at the northern sites. These results agree with the well-known positive effect of high temperatures on tree ring formation at high latitudes. However, we captured, for the first time in this region, the latent impact of water availability on xylem traits. Indeed, in all the four sites, cell lumen area showed positive correlations with daily precipitation (mostly at low latitude), and/or negative correlations with daily mean and maximum temperature and VPD (mostly at high latitude). We inferred that drought, due to high temperatures, low precipitations, or both, negatively affects cell enlargement across the closed boreal forest, including the northernmost sites. The production of tracheids with narrower lumen, potentially more resistant to cavitation, could increase xylem hydraulic safety under a warmer and drier climate. However, this would result in lower xylem conductivity, with consequent long-term hydraulic deterioration, growth decline, and possibly lead to tree dieback, as observed in other forest ecosystems at lower latitudes.",,,,"Carrer, Marco/D-8727-2011","Carrer, Marco/0000-0003-1581-6259; Castagneri, Daniele/0000-0002-2092-7415; Puchi, Paulina/0000-0001-5429-8605",European Union's Horizon 2020 [H2020-MSCA-IF-2017-788951],"European Union's Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: H2020-MSCA-IF-2017-788951",,,0,0,13,14,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

As a result, there are numerous potential applications for actionable predictions of when phenological events will occur. However, despite the availability of phenological data with large spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents, and numerous phenology models, there have been no automated species-level forecasts of plant phenology. This is due in part to the challenges of building a system that integrates large volumes of climate observations and forecasts, uses that data to fit models and make predictions for large numbers of species, and consistently disseminates the results of these forecasts in interpretable ways. Here, we describe a new near-term phenology-forecasting system that makes predictions for the timing of budburst, flowers, ripe fruit, and fall colors for 78 species across the United States up to 6 months in advance and is updated every four days.

The reasons for these declines are poorly understood, but are suggested to be linked to both local and global climatic factors, disease, and human interference. Hardangervidda plateau in Norway is home to the largest wild reindeer population in Europe, and is at the southern end of its European range. This population is therefore of particular importance, particularly in the light of climate change. We investigated how weather and hunting have affected the wild reindeer population in Hardangervidda over the last two decades. Our findings suggest that the wild reindeer population in Hardangervidda is most affected by winter temperature and hunting, where colder temperatures and lower harvest rates typically result in higher growth rates. We did not find significant evidence for linear density dependence.

Recently, the International Maritime Organization implemented management standards-D-2-where all large, commercial ships trading internationally are required to adopt an approved treatment system using technologies such as ultraviolet radiation or chlorination. However, current management regulations are based only on the total abundance of viable taxa transported (i.e. total propagule pressure), largely ignoring species richness (i.e. colonization pressure). To determine the efficacy of chlorine treatment in reducing invasion risks and changes in transported biological communities inside ballast tanks, we used DNA metabarcoding-based approaches to estimate colonization pressure (here, the number of species/operational taxonomic units [OTUs] introduced) and relative propagule pressure (relative abundance of each species/OTU) of zooplankton communities in control and chlorine treated tanks during four transatlantic voyages. Our study demonstrated that transport itself did not significantly reduce colonization pressure of zooplankton species, nor did chlorine treatment. Chlorine treatment altered community structure by reducing relative propagule pressure of some taxa such as Mollusca and Rotifera, while increasing relative propagule pressure of some Oligohymenophorea and Copepoda species. Synthesis and applications. Chlorine treatment may not reduce invasion risks as much as previously thought. Reduction in total propagule pressure does not mean reduction in abundance of all species equally. While some taxa might experience drastically reduced abundance, others might not change at all or increase due to hatching from dormant stages initiated by chlorine exposure. Therefore, management strategies should consider changes in total propagule pressure and colonization pressure when forecasting risk of new invasions. We therefore recommend adopting new approaches, such as DNA metabarcoding-based methods, to assess the whole biodiversity discharged from ballast water. As species responses to chlorine treatment are variable and affected by concentration, we also recommend a combination of different technologies to reduce introduction risks of aquatic organisms.",,,,"_, __/AAE-9616-2020; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020","Paolucci, Esteban/0000-0001-7847-1484",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31622021]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network; Alexander von Humboldt Sofja Kovalevskaja AwardAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M611020]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chair grantCanada Research Chairs,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31622021; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network; Alexander von Humboldt Sofja Kovalevskaja Award; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2017M611020; NSERC Discovery and Canada Research Chair grant",,,0,0,22,22,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Here, we analysed the largest set of acceleration data compiled to date for elasmobranchs to examine the relationship between volitional activity and temperature in 252 individuals from 8 species. We calculated activation energies for the thermal performance response in each species and estimated optimum temperatures using an Arrhenius breakpoint analysis, subsequently fitting thermal performance curves to the activity data. Juveniles living in confined nursery habitats not only spent substantially more time above their optimum temperature and at the upper limits of their performance breadths compared to larger, less site-restricted animals, but also showed lower activation energies and broader performance curves. Species or life stages occupying confined habitats featured more generalist behavioural responses to temperature change, whereas wider ranging elasmobranchs were characterised by more specialist behavioural responses. The relationships between the estimated performance regimes and environmental temperature limits suggest that animals in confined habitats, including many juvenile elasmobranchs within nursery habitats, are likely to experience a reduction of performance under a warming climate, although their flatter thermal response will likely dampen this impact.

In a case study of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, we used native and global occurrences to obtain native and global models representing narrower and broader understanding of zebra mussel' response to temperature. We also obtained thermal limit and survival information for zebra mussel from peer-reviewed literature and used the two types of information separately and jointly to calibrate native models. We showed that, compared to global models, native models predicted lower relative probability of presence along zebra mussel's upper thermal limit, suggesting the shortcoming of native models in predicting zebra mussel's response to warm temperature. We also found that native models showed improved prediction of relative probability of presence when thermal limit was used alone, and best approximated global models when both thermal limit and survival data were used. Our result suggests that integration of physiological knowledge enhances extrapolation of ENM in novel environments. Our modeling framework can be generalized for other species or other physiological limits and may incorporate evolutionary information (e.g. evolved thermal tolerance), thus has the potential to improve predictions of species' invasive potential and distributional response to climate change.",,,,"Gallardo, Belinda/H-9038-2013","Gallardo, Belinda/0000-0002-1552-8233; Feng, Xiao/0000-0003-4638-3927; Liang, Ye/0000-0002-6513-8962",NSF-OCI [1126330],The computing for this project was performed at the OSU High Performance Computing Center at Oklahoma State Univ. supported in part through the NSF-OCI 1126330.

However, its effects on dispersal should depend on dispersal syndromes, i.e. how dispersal covaries with phenotypic traits, because these syndromes can drastically alter dispersal and subsequent ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Our comprehension of whether environmental factors such as habitat fragmentation generate and/or modify dispersal syndromes (i.e. conditional dispersal syndromes) is therefore key for biodiversity forecasting. Here we tested whether habitat fragmentation modulates dispersal syndromes by experimentally manipulating matrix harshness, a critical feature of habitat fragmentation, in ciliate microcosms. We found evidence for dispersal syndromes involving multiple traits linked to morphology (elongation and size), movement (velocity and linearity) and demography (growth rate and maximal population density). More importantly, these syndromes were modified by matrix harshness, with increased differences between residents and dispersers in morphology and movement traits, and decreased differences in growth rate as the matrix became increasingly harsh. Our findings thus reveal that habitat fragmentation can mediate the intensity and form of dispersal syndromes, a context-dependence that could have important consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics under environmental changes.",,,,,,F.R.S.-FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [U.N035.16]; UCL-FSR; Move-In-Louvain Marie Curie Action postdoctoral fellowshipsEuropean Union (EU); scientific environment of the Laboratoire d'Excellence entitled TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41],This study was supported by the F.R.S.-FNRS (equipment grant U.N035.16) and UCL-FSR.

Here, we developed SDMs to explore potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability of ichthyoplankton. Location Yangtze Estuary, China. Methods Using long-term ichthyoplankton survey data and a large set of marine predictor variables, we developed ensemble SDMs for five abundant ichthyoplankton species in the Yangtze Estuary (Coilia mystus, Hypoatherina valenciennei, Larimichthys polyactis, Salanx ariakensis and Chelidonichthys spinosus). Then, we projected their habitat suitability under present and future climate conditions. Results The ensemble SDMs had good predictive performance and were successful in estimating the known distributions of the five species. Model projections highlighted two contrasting patterns of response to future climates: while C. mystus will likely expand its range, the ranges of the other four species will likely contract and shift northward. Main conclusions According to our SDM projections, the five ichthyoplankton species that we tested in the Yangtze Estuary are likely to respond differently to future climate changes. These projected different responses seemingly reflect the differential functional attributes and life-history strategies of these species. To the extent that climate change emerges as a critical driver of the future distribution of these species, our findings provide an important roadmap for designing future conservation strategies for ichthyoplankton in this region.",,,,,"Mammola, Stefano/0000-0002-4471-9055; Zhang, Zhixin/0000-0002-3457-2934; Zhang, Hui/0000-0002-6597-8910","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41976094, 31872568]; Key Deployment Program of Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS-JSPS-GJHZ1885]; Youth Talent Support Program of the Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao) [LMEES-YTSP-2018-01-12]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41976094 and 31872568; Key Deployment Program of Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: CAS-JSPS-GJHZ1885; the Youth Talent Support Program of the Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), Grant/Award Number: LMEES-YTSP-2018-01-12",,,0,0,5,5,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

The sporadic availability and diversity of resources can create highly dynamic systems. This is especially true in agro-ecological landscapes where the dynamic interplay of insect movement and heterogeneous landscapes hampers prediction of their spatio-temporal dynamics and population size. Objectives We therefore systematically looked at population-level consequences of different movement strategies in temporally-dynamic resource landscapes for an insect species whose movement strategy is slightly understood: the Queensland Fruit Fly (Bactrocera tryoni) Methods We developed a spatially-explicit model to predict changes in population dynamics and sizes in response to varying resources across a landscape. We simulated the temporal dynamics of fruit trees as the main resource using empirical fruiting dates. Movement strategies were derived from general principles and varied in directedness of movement and movement trigger. Results We showed that temporal continuity in resource availability was the main contributing factor for large and persistent populations. This explicitly included presence of continuous low-density resources such as fruit trees in urban areas. Analysing trapping data from SE Australia supported this finding. We also found strong effects of movement strategies, with directed movement supporting higher population densities. Conclusions These results give insight into structuring processes of spatial population dynamics of Queensland Fruit Fly in realistic and complex food production landscapes, but can also be extended to other systems. Such mechanistic understanding will help to improve forecasting of spatio-temporal hotspots and bottlenecks and will, in the end, enable more targeted population management.",,,,"Parry, Hazel/C-3643-2009; Schwarzmueller, Florian/W-2675-2017","Schwarzmueller, Florian/0000-0001-9751-0565",Australian Government Department of Agriculture & Water Resources as part of its Rural R&D for Profit program,"The authors would like to thank Tony Clarke for his help on parameterizing the model with regards to QFly's biology, and Penny Measham and several fruit-growers for a general information on host seasonality and their feedback on the model.

We used laboratory experiments to quantify the thermal tolerance and acclimation potential of four fishes (Notropis leuciodus, N. rubricroceus, Etheostoma rufilineatum, E. chlorobranchium) that are endemic to the southern Appalachian Mountains (USA), exhibit different historical elevational limits, and represent the two most species-rich families in the region. All-subsets selection of linear regression models using AIC(c) indicated that species, acclimation temperature, collection location and month, and the interaction between species and acclimation temperature were important predictors of thermal maxima (T-max), which ranged from 28.5 to 37.2 degrees C. Next, we implemented water temperature models and stochastic weather generation to characterize the magnitude and frequency of extreme heat events (T-extreme) under historical and future climate scenarios across 25 379 stream reaches in the upper Tennessee River system. Lastly, we used environmental niche models to compare warming tolerances (acclimation-corrected T-max minus T-extreme) between historically occupied versus unoccupied reaches. Historical warming tolerances, ranging from +2.2 to +10.9 degrees C, increased from low to high elevation and were positive for all species, suggesting that T-max does not drive warm-edge (low elevation) range limits. Future warming tolerances were lower (-1.2 to +9.3 degrees C) but remained positive for all species under the direst warming scenario except for a small proportion of reaches historically occupied by E. rufilineatum, indicating that T-max and acclimation potentials of southern Appalachian minnows and darters are adequate to survive future heat waves. We caution concluding that these species are invulnerable to 21st century warming because sublethal thermal physiology remains poorly understood. Integrating physiological sensitivity and warming exposure demonstrates a general and fine-grained approach to assess climate change vulnerability for freshwater organisms across physiographically diverse riverscapes.",,,,,"Giam, Xingli/0000-0002-5239-9477",,,,,0,0,9,9,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,NOV,2019,42,11,,,,,1913,1925,,10.1111/ecog.04576,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000493738800011,,,,,

The present study employs a novel methodology for the estimation of riverine dissolved oxygen using neural network models taking the spatial homogeneity of the water quality sampling sites into account. In three alternative configurations, a multivariate linear regression model, a radial basis function neural network and a general regression neural network are applied to discover which is best able to forecast dissolved oxygen effectively. Data from 13 water quality monitoring stations of the River Tisza are used, including runoff, water temperature, electric conductivity and pH. The three configurations are as follows: (i) a randomly chosen training and test set (which is then considered the reference model), (ii) a training and test set chosen in a spatially controlled way and (iii) a data set composed of two homogeneously behaving sampling sites with the addition of the site lying closest to these downstream. It was found that if the input of the linear model or the neural networks consists of a group or groups of sampling sites displaying homogeneous behavior, better performance is achieved in the estimation. Specifically, the best estimation of dissolved oxygen was achieved in the middle and lower reaches of the river, with an average of 81% and 87% of variance explained, respectively; the General Regression Neural Networks gave the best performance, in the middle reaches 85%, and 90% in the lower ones, even in the presence of a high degree of anthropogenic activity, as is the case with the River Tisza.",,,,,,"Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of SciencesHungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Ministry of Human Capacities [NTP-NFTO-17]; Szent Istvan University [FIEK_16-1-2016-0008, EFOP 3.4.3-16-2016-00012, 20430-3/2018/FEKUSTRAT]; MTA ""Lendulet"" program [LP2012-27/2012]","We would like to thank Paul Thatcher for his work on our English version.

Recently, studies that combined novel molecular techniques and model-based theoretical approaches suggested that cool temperature and drought synergistically drove GF. Although these advanced our understanding of GF, it is still difficult to know whether the individual-based molecular measurements and model-based mathematical representations reasonably well capture the complex and dynamic GF processes at the community level. In the present study, we collected a 17-year set of community-wide phenology data from Lambir Hills National Park in Borneo, Malaysia, and analyzed it using a model-free approach, empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), which does not rely on specific assumptions about the underlying mechanisms, to overcome and complement the previous limitations. We found that GF in the region is driven synergistically, not independently, by cool air temperature and drought, which is consistent with the previous studies. More importantly, our model-free approach showed for the first time that effects of cumulative meteorological variables on GF changed over time. The time-varying influences of meteorological variables on GF imply that the relationship between GF and meteorological variables might be influenced by other factors such as plant/soil nutrient resource dynamics.

The present study aimed to predict future shifts in major kelp species in northern Japan under different climate change scenarios. From a database of cold temperate kelp species in Japan, we extracted 1,958 data points to estimate the distribution of 11 kelp species that inhabit the waters around northern Japan. Distributions of the past (1980s) and the future (2040s and 2090s) were estimated using a species distribution model (MaxEnt). Variation in summer and winter sea surface temperatures was the factor most responsible for the estimated distribution patterns for most species; the length of natural rocky coasts and wave height were also important for some species. A forecast of shifts in distributions based on different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios showed that kelp species diversity in Japan would significantly decrease. By the 2090s, their habitat range overall was estimated to decline to 30-51% of that of the 1980s with moderate warming (Representative concentration pathways [RCP] 4.5) and to 0-25% with severe warming (RCP 8.5). The model predicted that 6 of 11 cold temperate kelp species may become extinct around Japan by the 2090s (RCP 8.5).

To win credibility and trust, they need validating. We show how expert knowledge can be used to assess a large number of empirical species niche models constructed for the British vascular plant and bryophyte flora. Key outcomes were (a) scored assessments of each modeled species and niche axis combination, (b) guidance on models needing further development, (c) exploration of the trade-off between presenting more complex model summaries, which could lead to more thorough validation, versus the longer time these take to evaluate, (d) quantification of the internal consistency of expert opinion based on comparison of assessment scores made on a random subset of models evaluated by both experts. Overall, the experts assessed 39% of species and niche axis combinations to be ""poor"" and 61% to show a degree of reliability split between ""moderate"" (30%), ""good"" (25%), and ""excellent"" (6%). The two experts agreed in only 43% of cases, reaching greater consensus about poorer models and disagreeing most about models rated as better by either expert. This low agreement rate suggests that a greater number of experts is required to produce reliable assessments and to more fully understand the reasons underlying lack of consensus.

In this mesocosm experiment, the survival, growth, and flowering of two hydric and two mesic wetland plant species were monitored under two extreme flood regimes, namely, repeated 2- and 7-day floods, and compared with unflooded conditions. Plant survival was not significantly affected by flooding, but species showed different growth and flowering responses to the flood regimes. The hydric species Cardamine pratensis showed contrasting responses to floods with significantly more flowering stems and longer leaves in the 2-day regime but delayed and poorer flowering in the 7-day regime. Juncus articulatus, the other hydric species, responded most actively to 7-day flooding, with significantly longer leaves, taller and more abundant flowering stems, and more flowers than in unflooded conditions. The mesic species Ranunculus acris showed variable growth and phenological responses to flooding, whereas Scorzoneroides autumnalis was most affected by the 7-day flood regime, producing significantly shorter leaves and flowering stems and fewer flowers earlier in the season, compared with unflooded conditions. Overall, repeated 7-day floods had a greater impact on plant performance than 2-day flood events. All four species showed resilience to extreme flooding, irrespective of whether they were classed as hydric or mesic, but there was differential tolerance between species.

Population models are thus important tools for both understanding and predicting animal responses to uncertain future conditions. Most approaches, however, are correlative and ignore the individual-level mechanisms that give rise to population dynamics. Here, we assess several existing population modelling approaches and find limitations to both 'correlative' and 'mechanistic' models. We advocate the need for a standardized mechanistic approach for linking individual mechanisms (physiology, behaviour, and evolution) to population dynamics in spatially explicit landscapes. Such an approach is potentially more flexible and informative than current population models. Key to realizing this goal, however, is overcoming current data limitations, the development and testing of eco-evolutionary theory to represent interactions between individual mechanisms, and standardized multi-dimensional environmental change scenarios which incorporate multiple stressors.

Machine learning techniques are used in a novel manner to capture model variability and analyse parameter sensitivity. We applied the framework to understand the spread of a devastating pest of tomato, Tuta absoluta, in South and Southeast Asia, a region at the frontier of its current range. Analysis with respect to historical invasion records suggests that even with modest self-mediated spread capabilities, the pest can quickly expand its range through domestic city-to-city vegetable trade.

Palaeoecological records are paramount to understand ecological memory at millennial time-scales, but the concept is widely neglected in the literature, and a formal approach is lacking. Here, we fill such a gap by introducing a quantitative framework for ecological memory in palaeoecology, and assessing how data constraints and taxa traits shape ecological memory patterns. We simulate the population dynamics and pollen abundance of 16 virtual taxa with different life and niche traits as a response to an environmental driver. The data is processed to mimic a realistic sediment deposition and sampled at increasing depth intervals. We quantify ecological memory with Random Forests, and assess how data properties and taxa traits shape ecological memory. We find that life-span and niche features modulate the relative importance of the antecedent values of the driver and the pollen abundance over periods of 240 yr and longer. Additionally, we find that accumulation rate and decreasing pollen-sampling resolution inflate the importance of antecedent pollen abundance. Our results suggest that: 1) ecological memory patterns are sensitive to varying accumulation rates. A better understanding on the numerical basis of this effect may enable the assimilation of ecological memory concepts and methods in palaeoecology; 2) incorporating niche theory and models is essential to better understand the nature of ecological memory patterns at millennial time-scales. 3) Long-lived generalist taxa are highly decoupled from the environmental signal. This finding has implications on how we interpret the abundance-environment relationship of real taxa with similar traits, and how we use such knowledge to forecast their distribution or reconstruct past climate.",,,,"Gil-Romera, Graciela/C-9262-2016; Birks, H.

In recent decades, the American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery has shifted poleward along the northwest Atlantic coast, one of the most rapidly warming regions of the world's oceans. Building on evidence that early post-settlement life stages predict future fishery recruitment, we describe enhancements to a forecasting model that predict landings using an annual larval settlement index from 62 fixed sites among 10 study areas from Rhode Island, USA to New Brunswick, Canada. The model is novel because it incorporates local bottom temperature and disease prevalence to scale spatial and temporal changes in growth and mortality. For nine of these areas, adding environmental predictors significantly improved model performance, capturing a landings surge in the eastern Gulf of Maine, and collapse in southern New England. On the strength of these analyses, we project landings within the next decade to decline to near historical levels in the Gulf of Maine and no recovery in the south.

The oak processionary moth (OPM) Thaumetopoea processionea causes serious damages to oak trees in forest, urban and other landscapes as well as severe allergic reactions to humans and animals. In the 1990's and 2000's, the OPM extended its range from mainland Europe and the Middle East into northern Europe. In 2005, it was also accidentally introduced in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the intensity and the frequency of OPM outbreaks are thought to have recently increased in several countries of Europe including Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. In the present study, we aimed at forecasting the potential distribution of the OPM in Europe under current and future climate conditions. We thoroughly compiled available records of established populations all across Europe and fitted MaxEnt and BIOCLIM models to infer bioclimatic requirements for this species. Both models showed good predictive performance under current climate conditions. In particular, the surroundings of London where the OPM recently got established were predicted as highly climatically suitable. Models also predicted that many parts of northern Europe where the OPM currently does not occur (e.g. central UK, Wales, Ireland, southern Scotland, Denmark, southern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, etc.) might become climatically suitable by 2050. Our predictions warrant the need for proper communication and management planning around the risks associated with the potential expansion of the OPM in Europe.",,,,,"Rossi, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-8139-1116",,,,,0,0,18,19,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

To evaluate eastern and western monarch populations the monarch SSA built on a foundation of published population models and other literature to identify current growth rates and information on threats and conservation efforts. Here we present the resulting methodology, which aimed to explore the magnitude of monarch population responses to the aggregation of multiple drivers under various scenarios. Our methodology differs from previous research by developing a series of functional cause and effect relationships that link monarch population-specific responses to threats or conservation actions. We incorporated these population-specific responses into stochastic geometric growth models for both eastern and western populations to estimate the probability of quasi-extinction in 50 years. Our models were parameterized using previously estimated population-specific trend data (growth rates and environmental variability) and expert elicited estimates of population responses to multiple drivers (i.e., amount of available breeding and overwintering habitat, insecticide use, migration resource availability, and climate change). We explored plausible future scenarios with realistic place-holder data to evaluate how changes in these drivers influenced monarch quasi-extinction risk for each population. In addition, we captured uncertainty in quasi-extinction risk by calculating cumulative quasi-extinction risk over a full range of quasi-extinction threshold values which were sampled from a uniform distribution bounded by expert-elicited estimates. In both populations, our baseline for comparison was the ""current"" condition defined by population-specific growth rate and environmental stochasticity from previous research. The result of the methodology presented here is a novel and comprehensive tool that incorporates the impact of future stressors into projections of population numbers over time. The approach provides a tractable and updatable tool that includes multiple types of information and the associated uncertainty of drivers, population impacts, and risk of extinction. For monarchs, this tool will be critical for incorporating the best scientific and commercial information available in the upcoming listing decision.",,,,,,Abra Prentice Foundation,MF's work was supported by the Abra Prentice Foundation.,,,1,1,16,16,,,,2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

This has prompted global efforts to restore the natural hydrologic regimes of developed shorelines, especially resource-rich estuaries, but the resilience of these restored ecosystems in the face of accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) remains uncertain. We implemented a Monitoring-based Simulation of Accretion in Coastal Estuaries (MOSAICS) in R statistical software to address uncertainty in the resilience of modified estuarine habitats, using the Nisqually River Delta in the Pacific Northwest USA as a case study. MOSAICS is a spatially explicit model with a numerical foundation that uses empirical monitoring datasets to forecast habitat change in response to rising tidal levels. Because it accounts for the crucial ecomorphodynamic feedbacks between tidal inundation, vegetative growth, and sediment accretion, MOSAICS can be used to determine whether alternative management scenarios, such as enhanced sediment inputs, will bolster estuarine resilience to SLR. Under moderate SLR (0.62 m), the model predicted that a two-fold increase in mean daily suspended sediment during the rainy season was sufficient to maintain Nisquallys emergent marshes through 2100, but under high SLR (1.35 m) MOSAICS indicated that greater sediment additions would be necessary to prevent submergence. A comparison between a restored marsh with subsided and high-elevation areas and a relict marsh demonstrated that the subsided restoration area was highly susceptible to SLR. Findings from the MOSAICS model highlight the importance of a sites initial elevation, capacity for producing above and belowground biomass, and suspended sediment availability when considering management actions in estuaries and other coastal ecosystems.",,,,"Woo, Isa/P-4885-2018","Woo, Isa/0000-0002-8447-9236",EPA Tribal Assistant [PA-00J15001]; Estuary and Salmon Restoration Program [13-1583P]; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; USGS Biologic Carbon Sequestration Program; USGS Ecosystem Mission Area; USFWS Coastal Program; USGS/USFWS Science Support Program; WERC program funds; American Dissertation Fellowship through the American Association of University Women,"This research was funded by EPA Tribal Assistant Grant no.

A typical characteristic of drylands is the spatial mosaic of vascular plant cover surrounded by interspace soils, where biological soil crusts (biocrusts)-a complex community of organisms including bacteria, fungi, algae, mosses, and lichens-are common. The implications of this heterogeneity, where plants and biocrust cover co-occur, are often explored in the context of soil fertility and hydrology, but rarely has the impact of these multiple microhabitat types been simultaneously explored to determine the influence on bacterial and fungal communities, key biological players in these ecosystems. Further, our understanding of the temporal dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities in grasslands, and of how these dynamics depend on the microhabitat within the ecosystem, is notably poor. Here we used a temporally and spatially explicit approach to assess bacterial and fungal communities in a grassland on the Colorado Plateau, and to link variation in these communities to edaphic characteristics. We found that microhabitat (e.g., vascular plant rhizosphere, biocrust, and below biocrust) was the strongest driver of differences in bacterial and fungal community richness, diversity, and composition. Microhabitat type also significantly mediated the impact of temporal change in shaping community composition. Taken together, 29% of the variation in bacterial community composition could be explained by microhabitat, date, and microhabitat-by-date interactions, while only 11% of the variation in fungal community composition could be explained by the same factors, suggesting important differences in community assembly processes. Soil microbial communities dictate myriad critical ecosystem functions, thus understanding the factors that control their compostition is crucial to considering and forecasting how terrestrial ecosystems work.

We studied the effects of changes in temperature, rainfall, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, solar radiation, and number of wet days (as a measure of rainfall intensity) on net primary productivity (NPP) of the Zambian Zambezi teak forests along a rainfall gradient. Using 1960-1989 as a baseline, we projected changes in NPP for the end of the 21st century (2070-2099). We adapted the parameters of the dynamic vegetation model, LPJ-GUESS, to simulate the growth of Zambian forests at three sites along a moisture gradient receiving annual rainfall of between 700 and more than 1000 mm. The adjusted plant functional type was tested against measured data. We forced the model with contemporary climate data (1960-2005) and with climatic forecasts of an ensemble of five general circulation models (GCMs) following Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We used local soil parameter values to characterize texture and measured local tree parameter values for maximum crown area, wood density, leaf longevity, and allometry. The results simulated with the LPJ-GUESS model improved when we used these newly generated local parameters, indicating that using local parameter values is essential to obtaining reliable simulations at site level. The adapted model setup provided a baseline for assessing the potential effects of climate change on NPP in the studied Zambezi teak forests. Using this adapted model version, NPP was projected to increase by 1.77% and 0.69% at the wetter Kabompo and by 0.44% and 0.10% at the intermediate Namwala sites under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 respectively, especially caused by the increased CO2 concentration by the end of the 21st century. However, at the drier Sesheke site, NPP would respectively decrease by 0.01% and 0.04% by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5. The projected decreased NPP under RCP8.5 at the Sesheke site results from the reduced rainfall coupled with increasing temperature. We thus demonstrated that differences in the amount of rainfall received in a site per year influence the way in which climate change will affect forest resources. The projected increase in CO2 concentration would thus have more effects on NPP in high rainfall receiving areas, while in arid regions, NPP would be affected more by the changes in rainfall and temperature. CO2 concentrations would therefore be more important in forests that are generally not temperature- or precipitation-limited; however, precipitation will continue to be the limiting factor in the drier sites.",,,,"Leemans, Rik/A-1548-2009","Leemans, Rik/0000-0002-4001-6301; Ngoma, Justine/0000-0003-1264-2249; Vinya, Royd/0000-0003-0478-2612",Copperbelt University; HEART project of the NUFFIC-NICHE programme; International Foundation for Science (IFS)International Foundation for Science [D/5466-1]; Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future,"This research was supported by the Copperbelt University, the HEART project of the NUFFIC-NICHE programme, the International Foundation for Science (IFS) (grant no.

At the same time, the scope of the necessary biodiversity monitoring is overwhelming funding for professional scientific monitoring. In response, scientists are increasingly using citizen science data to monitor biodiversity. But citizen science data are 'noisy', with redundancies and gaps arising from unstructured human behaviours in space and time. We ask whether the information content of these data can be maximized for the express purpose of trend estimation. We develop and execute a novel framework which assigns every citizen science sampling event a marginal value, derived from the importance of an observation to our understanding of overall population trends. We then make this framework predictive, estimating the expected marginal value of future biodiversity observations. We find that past observations are useful in forecasting where high-value observations will occur in the future. Interestingly, we find high value in both 'hotspots', which are frequently sampled locations, and 'coldspots', which are areas far from recent sampling, suggesting that an optimal sampling regime balances 'hotspot' sampling with a spread across the landscape.",,,,,"Callaghan, Corey/0000-0003-0415-2709; Poore, Alistair/0000-0002-3560-3659",,,,,1,1,4,8,,,,0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The blackflies are distinct in their annoying behavior. Their bite are very painful, causing discomfort to humans and animals. The matches of the 2018 World Cup in Volgograd were scheduled for the second half of June. The threat of mass flight activity of blackflies in that period could negatively affect environmental sanitation and hygiene, which would inevitably be followed by breaches of the guarantees given by the government to the International Federation of Football Associations. The development of a schedule of water releases from the Volgograd water-storage reservoir was proposed as a measures to reduce the risk of blackfly occurrence in the period of championship matches. It was based on the available information on the dependence of the blackfly number and the occurrence calendar on the parameters of spring high water in the Lower Volga River (water release volumes, their maximum levels, and the characteristics of their declines). Implementation of the project of scheduled water releases was a complicated and integrated task, since it required alignment with the operating of the upstream water-storage reservoirs with satisfaction of the demands of the users of the integrated water resource management on the Lower Volga River itself and the water storage reservoirs of the Volga-Kama River Cascade.

We hypothesize that cumulative actual evapotranspiration water loss (AET) from April to July is the precipitation-related variable most correlated to aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the U.S. Great Plains (GP). We tested this by evaluating the relationship of ANPP to AET, precipitation, and plant transpiration (Tr). We used multi-year ANPP data from five sites ranging from semiarid grasslands in Colorado and Wyoming to mesic grasslands in Nebraska and Kansas, mean annual NRCS ANPP, and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Results from the five sites showed that cumulative April-to-July AET, precipitation, and Tr were well correlated (R-2: 0.54-0.70) to annual changes in ANPP for all but the wettest site. AET and Tr were better correlated to annual changes in ANPP compared to precipitation for the drier sites, and precipitation in August and September had little impact on productivity in drier sites. April-to-July cumulative precipitation was best correlated (R-2 = 0.63) with interannual variability in ANPP in the most mesic site, while AET and Tr were poorly correlated with ANPP at this site. Cumulative growing season (May-to-September) NDVI (iNDVI) was strongly correlated with annual ANPP at the five sites (R-2 = 0.90). Using iNDVI as a surrogate for ANPP, we found that county-level cumulative April-July AET was more strongly correlated to ANPP than precipitation for more than 80% of the GP counties, with precipitation tending to perform better in the eastern more mesic portion of the GP. Including the ratio of AET to potential evapotranspiration (PET) improved the correlation of AET to both iNDVI and mean county-level NRCS ANPP. Accounting for how different precipitation-related variables control ANPP (AET in drier portion, precipitation in wetter portion) provides opportunity to develop spatially explicit forecasting of ANPP across the GP for enhancing decision-making by land managers and use of grassland ANPP for biofuels.",,,,,"Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736","US Department of Agriculture (USDA) UV-B Monitoring and Research Program, Colorado State University, under USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant [2016-34263-25763]; DOE Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0018420]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [58-3012-7-009, 58-5402-4-011]; University of Nebraska USDA Grass-Cast project [580111-18-018]","This work is supported by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) UV-B Monitoring and Research Program, Colorado State University, under USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant 2016-34263-25763.

As a consequence of these changes, several climate models forecast an intensification of extreme weather events over the upcoming decades, including heat waves and increasingly severe drought and flood episodes. The occurrence of such extreme weather will prompt profound changes in several plant communities, resulting in massive forest dieback events that can trigger a massive loss of biodiversity in several biomes worldwide. Despite the gravity of the situation, our knowledge regarding how extreme weather events can undermine the performance, survival, and distribution of forest species remains very fragmented. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide a broad and integrated perspective of the main biochemical, physiological, and morpho-anatomical disorders that may compromise the performance and survival of forest species exposed to climate change factors, particularly drought, flooding, and global warming. In addition, we also discuss the controversial effects of high CO2 concentrations in enhancing plant growth and reducing the deleterious effects of some extreme climatic events.

More variable demographic rates generally lead to lower population growth and can be detrimental to wild populations, especially if the particular demographic rates affected are those to which population growth is most sensitive. We investigated the population dynamics of a metapopulation of 25 colonies of a semi-arid bird species, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius, and how it was influenced by seasonal weather during 1993-2014. We constructed an integrated population model which estimated population sizes similar to observed population counts, and allowed us to estimate annual fecundity and recruitment. Variance in fecundity contributed most to variance in population growth, which showed no trend over time. No weather variables explained overall demographic variation at the population level. However, a separate analysis of the largest colony showed a clear decline with a high extinction probability (0.05 to 0.33) within 5years after the study period. In this colony, juvenile survival was lower when summers were hot, and adult survival was lower when winters were cold. Rainfall was also negatively correlated with adult survival. These weather effects could be due to increased physiological demands of thermoregulation and rainfall-induced breeding activity. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the population on the whole are buffered against current weather variation, as individual colonies apparently react in different ways. However, if more and increasingly extreme weather events synchronize colony dynamics, they are likely to have negative effects.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,8,9,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, predicting changes in ecosystem service value from restoration or management is challenging because environmental systems are highly complex and uncertain. Furthermore, benefits are diverse and accrue over various timescales. We developed a generalizable mathematical coastal management model to compare restoration expenditures to ecosystem service benefits and apply it to McInnis Marsh, Marin County, California, USA. We find that benefits of restoration outweigh costs for a wide range of assumptions. For instance, costs of restoration range from 8-30% of the increase in ecosystem service value over 50 years depending on discount rate. Flood protection is the dominant monetized service for most payback periods and discount rates, but other services (e.g., recreation) dominate on shorter timescales (> 50% of total value for payback periods <= 4 years). We find that the range of total ecosystem service value is narrower than overall variability reported in the literature, supporting the use of mechanistic methods in decision-making around coastal resiliency. However, the magnitude and relative importance of ecosystem services are sensitive to payback period, discount rate and risk tolerance, demonstrating the importance of probabilistic decision analysis.

The aim of this paper is the demonstration of a novel mathematical model capable to describe ectotherms life cycle, and to test it in the case of T. absoluta. A mathematical description can help farmers and stakeholders to forecast when the stages at which the insect is most susceptible to control strategies, will be reached. This will allow timely planning for the performance of the most efficient and environmentally friendly control strategy. The model is based on a first order partial differential equation, which can describe the density of population in function of the time t, and physiological age x, and which is driven by the environmental parameters and fundamental conditions for poikilothermic organisms. The result is a simulation of the life cycle, which depicts that the development of the insect is largely due to daily average temperature.

Despite the potential importance of natural variability such as diurnal temperature fluctuations, most experimental studies on warming are conducted under stable temperatures. Here, we investigated whether the responses of an aquatic invertebrate grazer (Lymnaea stagnalis) to an increased average temperature differ when the thermal regime is either constant or fluctuates diurnally. Using thermal response curves for several life-history and immune defense traits, we first identified the optimum and near-critically high temperatures that Lymnaea potentially experience during summer heat waves. We then exposed individuals that originated from three different populations to these two temperatures under constant or fluctuating thermal conditions. After 7 days, we assessed growth, reproduction, and two immune parameters (phenoloxidase-like activity and antibacterial activity of hemolymph) from each individual. Exposure to the near-critically high temperature led to increased growth rates and decreased antibacterial activity of hemolymph compared to the optimum temperature, whilst temperature fluctuations had no effect on these traits. The results indicate that the temperature level per se, rather than the variability in temperature was the main driver altering trait responses in our study species. Forecasting responses in temperature-related responses remains challenging, due to system-specific properties that can include intraspecific variation. However, our study indicates that experiments examining the effects of warming using constant temperatures can give similar predictions as studies with fluctuating thermal dynamics, and may thus be useful indicators of responses in nature.",,,,,"Seppala, Otto/0000-0001-7902-3069",Eawag discretionary funds,Eawag discretionary funds,,,1,1,2,3,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Abundance-based early warning signals have been shown to precede such declines, but detection prior to wild population collapses has had limited success, leading to the development of warning signals based on shifts in distribution of fitness-related traits such as body size. The dynamics of population abundances and traits in response to external environmental perturbations are controlled by a range of underlying factors such as reproductive rate, genetic variation and plasticity. However, it remains unknown how such ecological and evolutionary factors affect the stability landscape of populations and the detectability of abundance and trait-based early warning signals. Here, we apply a trait-based demographic approach and investigate both trait and population dynamics in response to gradual and increasing changes in the environment. We explore a range of ecological and evolutionary constraints under which stability of a population may be affected. We show both analytically and with simulations that strength of abundance- and trait-based warning signals are affected by ecological and evolutionary factors. Finally, we show that combining trait- and abundance-based information improves our ability to predict population declines.

However, no single vegetation model takes into account this growth form, although such efforts could greatly improve the predictions of carbon dynamics in tropical forests. In this study, we incorporated a novel mechanistic representation of lianas in a dynamic global vegetation model (the Ecosystem Demography Model). We developed a liana-specific plant functional type and mechanisms representing liana-tree interactions (such as light competition, liana-specific allometries, and attachment to host trees) and parameterized them according to a comprehensive literature meta-analysis. We tested the model for an old-growth forest (Paracou, French Guiana) and a secondary forest (Gigante Peninsula, Panama). The resulting model simulations captured many features of the two forests characterized by different levels of liana infestation as revealed by a systematic comparison of the model outputs with empirical data, including local census data from forest inventories, eddy flux tower data, and terrestrial laser scanner-derived forest vertical structure. The inclusion of lianas in the simulations reduced the secondary forest net productivity by up to 0.46 t(C) ha(-1) year(-1), which corresponds to a limited relative reduction of 2.6% in comparison with a reference simulation without lianas. However, this resulted in significantly reduced accumulated above-ground biomass after 70 years of regrowth by up to 20 t(C)/ha (19% of the reference simulation). Ultimately, the simulated negative impact of lianas on the total biomass was almost completely cancelled out when the forest reached an old-growth successional stage. Our findings suggest that lianas negatively influence the forest potential carbon sink strength, especially for young, disturbed, liana-rich sites.

We investigated whether congruent patterns of assemblage similarity across diverse taxa of hosts and parasites exist at a continental scale and quantified the relative importance of host assemblages and environmental variables in shaping these relationships. Location European freshwaters. Major taxa studied The hosts were fishes, birds and mammals. The parasites were monogeneans, trematodes and copepods. Methods We extracted distribution data from the Limnofauna Europaea for three aquatic parasite taxa and for three vertebrate taxa functioning as their definitive hosts across 25 biogeographical regions in Europe. First, we investigated beta-diversity congruence patterns between parasite and host assemblages, corrected for the distance between regions using partial Mantel tests. Second, we assessed the relative importance of host assemblages and environmental variables in shaping parasite beta-diversity patterns using generalized dissimilarity models (GDMs). Results Spatial community dissimilarities of regional parasite assemblages were positively correlated with those of their respective host assemblages in all five parasite-host groups studied. The GDMs highlighted the equal importance of both host assemblages and environmental variables in shaping parasite assemblages. However, the direct effect of host assemblages was relatively small compared with the effect of environmental factors mediated by host assemblages. Climatic parameters (precipitation and temperature) contributed most to the variance explained by environmental variables. Main conclusions Our analyses indicate that spatially congruent patterns of assemblage similarity exist between parasites and their hosts at a continental scale. They also suggest that this congruence is driven not only by host assemblages but also by environmental (climatic) variables, either directly or indirectly via their effects on host assemblages. Thus, environmental variables are important for mapping, forecasting and management of parasites at a geographical scale.",,,,"Thieltges, David/E-5719-2015; Hof, Christian/J-8888-2014","Hof, Christian/0000-0002-7763-1885","NERC CENTA [NE/L002493/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [L002493, 1];  [IDEA-707968]","NERC CENTA, Grant/Award Number: NE/L002493/1; Marie-Sklodowska Curie, Grant/Award Number: IDEA-707968; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: L002493 and 1",,,1,1,4,11,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Movement is often studied using mechanistic models, extrapolating short-term observations of individuals to longer-term predictions, but the role of weather variables such as air temperature and solar radiation, key determinants of ectotherm activity, are generally neglected. We aim to show how the effects of weather can be incorporated into individual-based models of butterfly movement thus allowing analysis of their effects. Methods We constructed a mechanistic movement model and calibrated it with high precision movement data on a widely studied species of butterfly, the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina), collected over a 21-week period at four sites in southern England. Day time temperatures during the study ranged from 14.5 to 31.5 degrees C and solar radiation from heavy cloud to bright sunshine. The effects of weather are integrated into the individual-based model through weather-dependent scaling of parametric distributions representing key behaviours: the durations of flight and periods of inactivity. Results Flight speed was unaffected by weather, time between successive flights increased as solar radiation decreased, and flight duration showed a unimodal response to air temperature that peaked between approximately 23 degrees C and 26 degrees C. After validation, the model demonstrated that weather alone can produce a more than two-fold difference in predicted weekly displacement. Conclusions Individual Based models provide a useful framework for integrating the effect of weather into movement models. By including weather effects we are able to explain a two-fold difference in movement rate of M. jurtina consistent with inter-annual variation in dispersal measured in population studies. Climate change for the studied populations is expected to decrease activity and dispersal rates since these butterflies already operate close to their thermal optimum.",,,,"Evans, Luke Christopher/AAM-7967-2020","Evans, Luke Christopher/0000-0001-8649-0589",BBSRC CASE/Syngenta PhD studentship award,L.

Nonlinear mixed-effects models offer a flexible approach to such data, but the estimation and interpretation of these models present challenges, partly associated with the lack of worked examples in the ecological literature. We illustrate the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach using temporal dynamics of vegetation moisture with field data from northwestern Patagonia. This is a Mediterranean-type climate region where modeling temporal changes in live fuel moisture content are conceptually relevant (ecological theory) and have practical implications (fire management). We used this approach to answer whether moisture dynamics varies among functional groups and aridity conditions, and compared it with other simpler statistical models. The modeling process is set out ""step-by-step"": We start translating the ideas about the system dynamics to a statistical model, which is made increasingly complex in order to include different sources of variability and correlation structures. We provide guidelines and R scripts (including a new self-starting function) that make data analyses reproducible. We also explain how to extract the parameter estimates from the R output. Our modeling approach suggests moisture dynamic to vary between grasses and shrubs, and between grasses facing different aridity conditions. Compared to more classical models, the nonlinear mixed-effects model showed greater goodness of fit and met statistical assumptions. While the mixed-effects approach accounts for spatial nesting, temporal dependence, and variance heterogeneity; the nonlinear function allowed to model the seasonal pattern. Parameters of the nonlinear mixed-effects model reflected relevant ecological processes. From an applied perspective, the model could forecast the time when fuel moisture becomes critical to fire occurrence. Due to the lack of worked examples for nonlinear mixed-effects models in the literature, our modeling approach could be useful to diverse ecologists dealing with complex data.",,,,"Bianchi, Lucas O/E-5305-2019","Bianchi, Lucas O/0000-0002-8125-6934; Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049",,,,,0,0,1,1,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here we also focus on such a case by targeting the inhabited land area, Alaska. During 2-18 August 2015, ship-borne radiosonde sounding observations were performed every 12 h (except 6-hourly from 12:00 UTC 11 August to 00:00 UTC 14 August) around the Chukchi Sea. To assess the impact of those extra radiosonde observations, two sets of ensemble forecast experiments (CTLf and OSE_A(f)) were produced, which were respectively initialized by atmospheric reanalysis data without (CTL) and with (OSE_A) additional assimilation of those data. The tropospheric circulation fields are compared to verify their differences in forecast performance. While two forecasts have similar performance in the earlier spin-up period of the analysis-forecast cycle (from 4 to 7 August), their performance tends to diverge in the later period (from 11 to 18 August) due to the accumulated influence on the error reduction in OSE_Af. Among the improved forecasts in OSE_Af, two most outperformed forecasts, each initialized on 00:00 UTC 12 and 00:00 UTC 14, show a notable improvement in predicting the developing trough over Alaska on 16-17 August by suppressing the development of erroneous high anomalies in CTLf.

Therefore, precise prediction of sea ice distribution during the cyclones is crucial for safe and efficient navigation in the Arctic Ocean. A high-resolution (about 2.5 km) ice-ocean coupled model is developed for forecasting the short-term sea ice distribution along the Arctic sea routes. Since a commercial ship navigates to avoid the sea ice as much as possible, a factor to score the forecast skill is considered to be ice edge error which is an averaged distance between forecasted and observed ice edges. First, we discuss the influence of horizontal grid resolution on short-term sea ice predictions during May to November 2015. The model grid resolution is varied from 2.5 km, 5 km, 10 km and 15 km. This grid dependency study suggests that the 2.5 km resolution model predicts the ice edge accurately compared to the satellite observations. Second, the primary experiment was run from 2 August 2016 to 7 August 2016 under the extreme cyclone in the Laptev Sea using ensemble predictions. The ensembles are constructed by using forecasted atmospheric forcing data sets from THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) project and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis data. The ensemble ice edge errors are computed from 2 August 2016 to 7 August 2016. The maximum forecast skill of ensemble average ice edge error in the ice-ocean coupled model is 11.74 +/- 0.54 km with the threshold of 15% ice concentration for the AMSR2 and model predicted ice edges.

A major challenge for development of SSAs includes inconsistent or incomplete monitoring throughout a species' range, which can result from inadequate time and funding for data collection prior to final rulings. In 2014, the USFWS initiated an SSA for the Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii; hereafter pipit), a migratory songbird scheduled for consideration as Threatened or Endangered in fall 2015. At the time, researchers had no field data to identify the spatial distribution of habitat across the geographic extent of the pipit's wintering grounds or to forecast the species' response to probable future scenarios of environmental conditions or conservation efforts during winter. In addition, the timing of the ESA decision precluded range-wide surveys on the pipit's wintering grounds. We present an SSA case study to demonstrate how citizen science and remotely sensed data could be integrated to help inform time-sensitive policy decisions for species of conservation concern. We developed three independent estimates of potential pipit habitat, and we assumed that spatial congruence among models provided increased evidence of habitat likely to support our focal species.

Our study focused on the vulnerability for all upland ecosystem types of Arizona and New Mexico in the southwestern United States. Local vulnerability across the two-state area was represented by the level of departure for late 21st-century climate from the characteristic pre-1990 climate envelope of the ecosystem type at each given location, resulting in a probability surface of climate impacts for the two-state area and an uncertainty assessment based on agreement in results among multiple global climate models. Though the results varied from one ecosystem type to the next, the majority of lands were forecast as high vulnerability and low uncertainty, reflecting significant agreement among climate model projections for the southwestern United States. We then tested our results in relation to ongoing ecological processes that have both regional and global change implications and discovered significant relationships with wildfire severity, upward tree species recruitment, and the encroachment of scrub into semidesert grassland. The testing helped determine the efficacy of the vulnerability surface, as a product of relatively high spatial and thematic resolution, in supporting local planning and management decisions.

Understanding how local feedbacks operate within heterogeneous coastal environments is essential to forecasting marsh persistence and loss in response to sea level rise, river impoundment, and other environmental changes. In coastal lagoons, feedbacks between open water, wind erosion, and stabilizing effects from wetland vegetation produce two states: open water with fringing marshes, and marsh-dominated basins. Unknown is whether, how, and at what scales these feedbacks affect distribution of marsh ecosystems in large, complex estuaries, where macroscale coastal and watershed characteristics control suspended sediment and wind energy. Using a multi-scale geospatial analysis spanning the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the USA, we show that characteristics of estuaries (depth, shoreline complexity, land use, tidal range, latitude) and their watersheds (discharge) best predict wetland extent at broad spatial scales (similar to> 10(2) km(2)). Bimodal distribution of wetland extent occurs at finer scales (similar to 10(0) to 10(2) km(2)) that correspond to the theoretical scale of wave erosion feedbacks. Local feedbacks are thus the mechanism that controls marsh dynamics, whereas coastal and watershed characteristics determine macroscale wetland distributions through their effects on these processes. In coastal marshes, and likely in other complex landscapes, the spatial extent of feedbacks shapes the scales at which local and macroscale processes control the distribution of alternative stable states. These findings help predict scales at which coastal wetlands will respond catastrophically or continuously to environmental change, and provide a basis for multi-scale strategies to protect and restore coastal wetland ecosystems.",,,,,"Braswell, Anna/0000-0002-3677-0635",N.S.F.

These drivers forcing widespread changes in rangeland ecosystem processes and vegetation dynamics create two-way interactions and feedback loops between biogeochemistry and vegetation composition. To support spatial simulation and forecasting in the global rangelands, the G-Range global rangelands model couples biogeochemical submodels from the CENTURY soil organic matter model with dynamic populations' submodels for herbs, shrubs, and trees. Here is presented a model description for G-Range, including novel elements of G-Range and implementation of CENTURY code. An initial evaluation of G-Range at global and site scales follows. G-Range outputs for net primary productivity (NPP) and vegetation cover (herbs, shrubs, trees, bare ground) were evaluated against global MODIS layers at global and site scales, and aboveground and belowground NPP were compared with field data from globally distributed sites. Most model outputs evaluated were within the range of a priori benchmarks for tolerable absolute or relative error (two benchmarks per output, at two scales, for five outputs of NPP and vegetation cover). Trade-offs in model fit among variables, datasets, and scales indicated practical constraints on improving model fit with respect to the selected evaluation datasets, especially field NPP versus MODIS NPP. The relative effects of multiple drivers of rangeland vegetation change were the greatest sources of uncertainty in model outputs. G-Range is best suited to scenario analysis of large-scale and long-term impacts of climate, CO2, and management on rangeland ecosystem processes and vegetation, as well as ecosystem services, such as production of forage and browse and carbon sequestration.

In this study, our aim is to identify knowledge gaps, monitoring assessment objectives, and management recommendations that should be critically reviewed through the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles of adaptive management. In the watershed, the presence of multiple SWAT applications provides assurance that a wide array of physical, chemical, and biological processes with distinct characterizations are used to reproduce the patterns of flow and nutrient export in agricultural lands. While there are models with more advanced mechanistic representation of certain facets of the hydrological cycle (surface runoff, groundwater and sediment erosion) or better equipped to depict urban settings, we believe that greater insights will be gained by revisiting several influential assumptions (tile drainage, fertilizer/manure application rates, land-use/landcover data) and recalibrating the existing SWAT models to capture both baseline and event-flow conditions and daily nutrient concentration (not loading) variability in multiple locations rather than a single downstream site. It is also critical to redesign land-use management scenarios by accommodating recent conceptual and technical advancements of their life-cycle effectiveness, the variability in their starting operational efficiency, and differential response to storm events or seasonality, as well as the role of legacy phosphorus. In the receiving waterbody, the development of data-driven models to establish causal linkages between the trophic status of Lake Erie and external phosphorus loading represents a pragmatic means to draw forecasts regarding the phyto-plankton community response to different management actions. Two critical next steps to further augment the empirical modelling work is the iterative updating as more data are acquired through monitoring and the introduction of additional explanatory variables that are likely associated with the occurrence of cyanobacteria-dominated blooms. The majority of the process-based models are not constrained by the available data, and therefore their primary value is their use as heuristic tools to advance our understanding of Lake Erie. The validation of their predictive power should become one of the overarching objectives of the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles. With respect to the projected responses of the system to nutrient loading reduction, we express our skepticism with the optimistic predictions of the extent and duration of hypoxia, given our limited knowledge of the sediment diagenesis processes in the central basin along with the lack of data related to the vertical profiles of organic matter and phosphorus fractionation or sedimentation/burial rates. Our study also questions the adequacy of the coarse spatiotemporal (seasonal/annual, basin- or lake-wide) scales characterizing the philosophy of both water quality management objectives and modelling enterprise in Lake Erie, as this strategy seems somewhat disconnected from the ecosystem services targeted. We conclude by emphasizing that the valuation of ecosystem services should be integrated into the decision-making process, as we track the evolution of the system over time.",,,,"Arhonditsis, George/AAI-7897-2020; Arhonditsis, George B/C-6980-2009","Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; Dong, Feifei/0000-0003-1241-1563",International Joint Commission [1042700743],"This project has received funding support from the International Joint Commission (Requisition Number 1042700743).

These differences could result in sex-specific responses to change, but such demographic effects are poorly understood. Here, we test for sex-specific differences in the demography of northern (NGP, Macronectes halli) and southern (SGP, M. giganteus) giant petrels - strongly sexually size-dimorphic birds that breed sympatrically at South Georgia, South Atlantic Ocean. Both species feed at sea or on carrion on land, but larger males (30% heavier) are more reliant on terrestrial foraging than the more pelagic females. Using multi-event mark-recapture models, we examine the impacts of long-term changes in environmental conditions and commercial fishing on annual adult survival and use two-sex matrix population models to forecast future trends. As expected, survival of male NGP was positively affected by carrion availability, but negatively affected by zonal winds. Female survival was positively affected by meridional winds and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and negatively affected by sea ice concentration and pelagic longline effort. Survival of SGPs did not differ between sexes; however, survival of males only was positively correlated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Two-sex population projections indicate that future environmental conditions are likely to benefit giant petrels. However, any potential increase in pelagic longline fisheries could reduce female survival and population growth. Our study reveals that sex-specific ecological differences can lead to divergent responses to environmental drivers (i.e. climate and fisheries). Moreover, because such effects may not be apparent when all individuals are considered together, ignoring sex differences could underestimate the relative influence of a changing environment on demography.",,,,"Choquet, Remi/F-6462-2011; Pradel, Roger/A-8666-2008; Sherley, Richard/D-7507-2012","Choquet, Remi/0000-0003-0434-9085; Pradel, Roger/0000-0002-2684-9251; Gianuca, Dimas/0000-0002-7810-9482; Sherley, Richard/0000-0001-7367-9315",Science Without Borders Program,"We are very grateful to the many fieldworkers involved in the long-term monitoring of giant petrels at Bird Island.

The in-depth knowledge of the complex relationships between climate and population sizes through density dependent demographic processes is important for understanding and predicting population shifts under climate change, which requires integrated population models (IPMs) that unify the analyses of demography and abundance data. In this study we developed an IPM based on Gaussian approximation to dynamic N-mixture models for large scale population data. We then analyzed four decades (1972-2013) of mallard Anas platyrhynchos breeding population survey, band-recovery and climate data covering a large spatial extent from North American prairies through boreal habitat to Alaska. We aimed to test the hypothesis that climate change will cause shifts in population dynamics if climatic effects on demographic parameters that have substantial contribution to population growth vary spatially. More specifically, we examined the spatial variation of climatic effects on density dependent population demography, identified the key demographic parameters that are influential to population growth, and forecasted population responses to climate change. Our results revealed that recruitment, which explained more variance of population growth than survival, was sensitive to the temporal variation of precipitation in the southern portion of the study area but not in the north. Survival, by contrast, was insensitive to climatic variation. We then forecasted a decrease in mallard breeding population density in the south and an increase in the northwestern portion of the study area, indicating potential shifts in population dynamics under future climate change. Our results implied that different strategies need to be considered across regions to conserve waterfowl populations in the face of climate change. Our modelling approach can be adapted for other species and thus has wide application to understanding and predicting population dynamics in the presence of global change.",,,,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through the U.S. Geological Survey Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit [G11AC20327],"We thank all the people who have conducted the waterfowl population survey and band-recovery survey, and maintained the data sets.

However, fossil records dating from 70 +/- 4 ka (ka = 10(3) yr) from south-western Australia and the Nullarbor Plain are evidence of subpopulation extinctions in the southwest at least after the Last Interglacial (similar to 128-116 ka). We hypothesize that koala sub-population extinctions resulted from the eastward retraction of the koala's main browse species in response to unsuitable climatic conditions. We further posit a general reduction in the distribution of main koala-browse trees in the near future in response climate change. We modelled 60 koala-browse species and constructed a set of correlative species distribution models for five time periods: Last Interglacial (similar to 128-116 ka), Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 23-19 ka), Mid-Holocene (similar to 7-5 ka), present (interpolations of observed data, representative of 1960-1990), and 2070. We based our projections on five hindcasts and one forecast of climatic variables extracted from WorldClim based on two general circulation models (considering the most pessimistic scenario of high greenhouse-gas emissions) and topsoil clay fraction. We used 17 dates of koala fossil specimens identified as reliable from 70 (+/- 4) to 535 (+/- 49) ka, with the last appearance of koalas at 70 ka in the southwest. The main simulated koala-browse species were at their greatest modelled extent of suitability during the Last Glacial Maximum, with the greatest loss of koala habitat occurring between the Mid-Holocene and the present. We predict a similar habitat loss between the present and 2070. The spatial patterns of habitat change support our hypothesis that koala extinctions in the southwest, Nullarbor Plain and central South Australia resulted from the eastward retraction of the dominant koala-browse species in response to long-term climate changes. Future climate patterns will likely increase the extinction risk of koalas in their remaining eastern ranges.",,,,"CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019; Saltre, Frederik/I-4961-2012; Bradshaw, Corey/A-1311-2008","Saltre, Frederik/0000-0002-5040-3911; Bradshaw, Corey/0000-0002-5328-7741; Haberle, Simon/0000-0001-5802-6535; Peters, Katharina J./0000-0002-5967-0928; Shabani, Farzin/0000-0002-5100-8921; Champreux, Antoine/0000-0001-9910-2223",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and HeritageAustralian Research Council [CE170100015],This research was done by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CE170100015; EpicAustralia.org).,,,2,2,11,28,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,SEP,2019,42,9,,,,,1587,1599,,10.1111/ecog.04530,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000483710100013,,,,,

Here, we synthesized ecosystem carbon-cycling data from 1,119 experiments performed over the past four decades concerning changes in temperature, precipitation, CO2 and nitrogen across major terrestrial vegetation types of the world. Most experiments manipulated single rather than multiple global change drivers in temperate ecosystems of the USA, Europe and China. The magnitudes of warming and elevated CO2 treatments were consistent with the ranges of future projections, whereas those of precipitation changes and nitrogen inputs often exceeded the projected ranges. Increases in global change drivers consistently accelerated, but decreased precipitation slowed down carbon-cycle processes. Nonlinear (including synergistic and antagonistic) effects among global change drivers were rare. Belowground carbon allocation responded negatively to increased precipitation and nitrogen addition and positively to decreased precipitation and elevated CO2. The sensitivities of carbon variables to multiple global change drivers depended on the background climate and ecosystem condition, suggesting that Earth system models should be evaluated using site-specific conditions for best uses of this large dataset.

To isolate long-term effects of [CO2] on water use efficiency at ecosystem level, we used the FORECAST Climate forest model, calibrated for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in the southwestern Pyrenees, growing at a Mediterranean montane site and at a continental subalpine site. Future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were generated using a battery of six climate models to estimate daily values of temperature and precipitation in a 90-year series. A factorial experiment was designed to disentangle the importance on C pools of three growing limiting factors (nitrogen limitation, climate (temperature + precipitation) limitation and atmospheric CO2 concentration). The relative importance of each factor was quantified by comparing the scenario with the limitation of each individual factor turned on with the non-limitation scenario. Positive CO2 fertilization due to improvement in water use efficiency was detected by the model, but its quantitative impact improving tree growth was minimum: its average increase in ecosystem C pools ranged from 0.3 to 0.9%. At the site with cooler climate conditions (continental), the main limitation for tree growth was climate. Such limitation will be reduced under climate change and the ecosystem will store more carbon. At the site with milder climate conditions (Mediterranean), N availability was the main limiting factor albeit modulated by water availability. Such limitation could be reduced under climate change as N cycling could accelerate (higher litterfall production and decomposition rates) but also increase if droughts become more frequent and severe. In addition, the magnitude of the uncertainty related to climate model selection was much more important than CO2 fertilization, indicating that atmospheric processes are more important than tree physiological processes when defining how much carbon could be gained (or lost) in forests under climate change. In conclusion, due to the small changes in forest C pools caused by variation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations compared to changes caused by other growth limiting factors (nutrients, climate), reducing uncertainty related to climate projections seems a more efficient way to reduce uncertainty in tree growth projections than increasing forest model complexity.",,,,"Blanco, Juan A./A-4554-2009; de Andres, Ester Gonzalez/AAH-3710-2019","Blanco, Juan A./0000-0002-6524-4335; Gonzalez de Andres, Ester/0000-0001-7951-5426","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2012-33465, AGL2016-76463-P]; Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2011-08082]; Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU) [CIG-2012-326718-ECOPYREN3, H2020-MSCA-IF-2014-DENDRONUTRENT]","The authors wish to thank all the previous graduate and undergraduate students working at UPNA' s Ecology and Environment Group who had made possible to gather the 19-year long databases used for model calibration.

Further, we examined whether latitudinal differences in taxonomic composition resulted from species replacement with organisms better adapted to northerly conditions or from the loss of taxa unable to tolerate the harsh environments of higher latitudes. We used the bioclimatic envelope concept to provide a first approximation forecast of how climate warming may modify alpha and beta diversity of Arctic rivers and to identify potential changes in environmental variables that will drive future assemblage structure. Benthic macroinvertebrates, environmental supporting variables, and geospatial catchment data were collected to assess drivers of ecological pattern. We compared alpha diversity (i.e., taxonomic richness) across latitudes and partitioned beta diversity into components of nestedness and species turnover to assess their relative contributions to compositional differences. We found sharp declines in taxonomic richness along a latitudinal gradient. This alpha diversity pattern was not associated with a change in numerical abundance. beta diversity was highest when the most distant latitudes were compared, and pairwise latitudinal comparisons indicated that nestedness (loss of species) was the dominant contributor to compositional differences. Biotic-abiotic associations reflected both large-scale climatic drivers, including air temperature and prevalence of vegetated tundra, and small-scale secondary abiotic drivers of assemblage composition (e.g., substrate composition, water chemistry). The importance of nestedness to beta diversity across latitudes supports the physiological tolerance hypothesis that a change in environmental tolerance is a key driver of species richness declines with increasing latitude. Distinct taxonomic assemblages among low and high Arctic latitude sites were associated with large-scale, climate-related drivers (e.g., temperature trends, terrestrial vegetation), reflecting the primary structuring of assemblages by bioclimatic envelopes. The abiotic environment was the strongest driver of assemblage structure at high latitudes because of the extreme conditions. With continued warming, biodiversity differences along latitudinal gradients are expected to become less pronounced as temperatures and vegetation become more similar from south to north, with local-scale variables becoming dominant biotic drivers.",,,,"Lento, Jennifer/Y-4082-2019","Lento, Jennifer/0000-0002-8098-4825",Environment Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This work is a component of the Arctic BioNet program of the International Polar Year.

We investigated temporal variability in the abundance and assemblage composition of coastal organisms in northern Lake Michigan. We sampled nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, benthic invertebrates, and fish along the east coast of Beaver Island, Michigan, USA, with high temporal frequency (every d to every 2 wk) over 2 summers. We also examined connectivity between coastal and offshore habitats with both hourly water current data from the Great Lakes Coastal Forecasting System and sampling offshore 2 to 3x per summer. The abundance of littoral zone organisms varied markedly on daily to weekly timescales for both benthic invertebrates and water-column organisms (phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish). For example, zooplankton abundance changed by a mean of 297% between sampling dates at the same location. Within-season peaks in plankton abundance also differed among years. Specifically, peak chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were observed 1 mo earlier in 2016 than 2015, and early summer (Jun) zooplankton abundance was 333% higher in 2016 than 2015. Furthermore, our data suggest that water currents may influence the abundance and assemblage composition of plankton, possibly by altering the flux of nutrients and organisms from offshore to coastal habitats. Specifically, zooplankton abundance increased by a mean of 194% when surface currents moved eastward before we sampled, and eastward surface velocity significantly altered zooplankton assemblage composition. Chl a concentration increased by a mean of 106% when surface currents moved northward prior to sampling. In contrast, the abundance and composition of benthic invertebrates and fish differed among sites and was not significantly related to water currents. The abundance of these organisms also declined throughout the summer. Therefore, benthic and water-column organisms are controlled by different processes, so patterns in their local abundance are out of sync. Understanding variability in coastal communities may enhance monitoring and design of effective protocols for investigating large lake ecology. Further, understanding the importance of regional movement of nutrients and organisms may be key to understanding community and ecosystem structure in coastal areas.",,,,,,Institute for Great Lakes Research at Central Michigan University,"We would like to thank J.

Although a host of methods and tools have been proposed to accomplish this undertaking, several challenges remain in accurately forecasting occurrence and abundance for highly mobile species. Exhibiting extensive geographic ranges with seasonally varying local occupancy, migratory ducks are exemplar highly mobile species and are foci for waterfowl conservation and management globally. With the goal of informing species conservation and management, our aim was to leverage citizen science data to estimate occurrence and relative abundance for ten dabbling duck species across the continental United States. Location Conterminous United States. Methods We applied spatially and temporally explicit Bayesian hierarchical modelling to jointly estimate season-specific occurrence and relative abundance for ten dabbling duck species in the Genus Anas. Our conditionally dependent model design enabled relative abundance estimates to be informed by occurrence probability while accounting for cumulative spatial and temporal errors across shared model components. Results Outcomes suggest that although dabbling duck distributions show little inter-annual variability at the continental scale, local relative abundances may differ year to year. Commensurate with being highly mobile migratory species, estimates indicate considerable intra-annual variation with occurrence probability, local abundance and habitat preferences differing by season and species. Main conclusions Our approach offers a powerful and flexible framework for quantifying intra-/inter-annual duck occurrence and relative abundance while accounting for spatial, temporal and data collection biases. We believe that model produced maps can be applied to inform waterfowl conservation and management throughout the continental United States.",,,,"Humphreys, John/AAF-7586-2019","Humphreys, John/0000-0002-8464-0886; Mullinax, Jennifer/0000-0003-4695-059X",,,,,0,0,1,5,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

The pollen of these species is a major source of allergens. However, surprisingly little published research has addressed methods for predicting the allergy risk prompted by this pollen. In this work, we developed models for predicting airborne Platanus pollen concentrations constructed using data from central Spain. Predictions are very useful to alert citizens and give allergy patients advanced warning of expected high airborne pollen concentrations. The prediction models indicate that airborne Platanus pollen concentrations can be forecasted up to seven days (one week) in advance, using a method which combines the analysis of long-term aerobiological data (in this case, over the eleven-year study period), in order to detect seasonal trends within time-series, with the modelling of short-term fluctuations in airborne pollen concentrations prompted by daily changes in meteorological variables and pollen concentrations over the previous days. The meteorological variables studied were maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. The results of the validation of prediction models yielded a coefficient of correlation between observed and predicted values of R = 0.7, indicating that these models predict most of the pollen peaks in the airborne pollen curve.",,,,,"Perez-Badia, Rosa/0000-0002-2471-4388","Consejerla de Agricultura, Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo Rural of the Castilla-La Mancha Regional Government; University of Castilla-La Mancha through the ""Plan Propio de I + D + I""","This study was supported by the ""Consejerla de Agricultura, Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo Rural"" of the Castilla-La Mancha Regional Government, and by the University of Castilla-La Mancha through the ""Plan Propio de I + D + I"".

However, empirical assessments of temporal fluctuations in age structure and their effects on population growth rate are relatively rare. Most research has focused on understanding the contribution of changing vital rates to population growth rates and these analyses routinely assume that: (a) populations have stable age distributions, (b) environmental influences on vital rates and age structure are stationary (i.e. the mean and/or variance of these processes does not change over time), and (c) dynamics are independent of density. Here we quantified fluctuations in age structure and assessed whether they were stationary for four populations of free-ranging vertebrates: moose (observed for 48 years), elk (15 years), tawny owls (15 years) and grey wolves (17 years). We also assessed the extent that fluctuations in age structure were useful for predicting annual population growth rates using models which account for density dependence. Fluctuations in age structure were of a similar magnitude to fluctuations in abundance. For three populations (moose, elk, owls), the mean and the skew of the age distribution fluctuated without stabilizing over the observed time periods. More precisely, the sample variance (interannual variance) of age structure indices increased with the length of the study period, which suggests that fluctuations in age structure were non-stationary for these populations - at least over the 15- to 48-year periods analysed. Fluctuations in age structure were associated with population growth rate for two populations. In particular, population growth varied from positive to negative for moose and from near zero to negative for elk as the average age of adults increased over its observed range. Non-stationarity in age structure may represent an important mechanism by which abundance becomes non-stationary - and therefore difficult to forecast - over time-scales of concern to wildlife managers. Overall, our results emphasize the need for vertebrate populations to be modelled using approaches that consider transient dynamics and density dependence and that do not rely on the assumption that environmental processes are stationary.

Here we meta-analyzed the likely effects of climate change on the potential geographic distribution of 1,205 bird species from the Neotropical region, modeled using eight ENMs and three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM). We considered the variability in ENMs performance to estimate a weighted mean difference between potential geographic distributions for baseline and future climates. On average, potential future ranges were projected to be from 25.7% to 44.5% smaller than current potential ranges across species. However, we found that 0.2% to 18.3% of the total variance in range shifts occurred ""within species"" (i.e., owing to the use of different modeling techniques and climate models) and 81.7% to 99.8% remained between species (i.e., it could be explained by ecological correlates). Using meta-analytical techniques akin to regression, we also showed that potential range shifts are barely predicted by bird biological traits. We demonstrated that one can combine and reduce species-specific effects with high uncertainty in ENMs and also explore potential causes of climate change effect on species using meta-analytical tools. We also highlight that the search for powerful correlates of climate change-induced range shifts can be a promising line of investigation.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Ortega, Jean C.

Improved forecasting of future changes in SOM is needed to support the development of more sustainable land management under a changing climate. Current models fail to reproduce historical trends in SOM both within and during transition between ecosystems. More realistic spatio-temporal SOM dynamics require inclusion of the recent paradigm shift from SOM recalcitrance as an 'intrinsic property' to SOM persistence as an 'ecosystem interaction'. We present a soil profile, or pedon-explicit, ecosystem-scale framework for data and models of SOM distribution and dynamics which can better represent land use transitions. Ecosystem-scale drivers are integrated with pedon-scale processes in two zones of influence. In the upper vegetation zone, SOM is affected primarily by plant inputs (above- and belowground), climate, microbial activity and physical aggregation and is prone to destabilization. In the lower mineral matrix zone, SOM inputs from the vegetation zone are controlled primarily by mineral phase and chemical interactions, resulting in more favourable conditions for SOM persistence. Vegetation zone boundary conditions vary spatially at landscape scales (vegetation cover) and temporally at decadal scales (climate). Mineral matrix zone boundary conditions vary spatially at landscape scales (geology, topography) but change only slowly. The thicknesses of the two zones and their transport connectivity are dynamic and affected by plant cover, land use practices, climate and feedbacks from current SOM stock in each layer. Using this framework, we identify several areas where greater knowledge is needed to advance the emerging paradigm of SOM dynamics-improved representation of plant-derived carbon inputs, contributions of soil biota to SOM storage and effect of dynamic soil structure on SOM storage-and how this can be combined with robust and efficient soil monitoring.",,,,"Cosby, Bernard/B-5653-2012; Whitaker, Jeanette/A-9266-2013; Evans, Christopher D/F-2087-2010; Emmett, Bridget A/D-6199-2011; Griffiths, Robert I/D-5237-2011; Robinson, David A/A-6287-2010","Cosby, Bernard/0000-0001-5645-3373; Whitaker, Jeanette/0000-0001-8824-471X; Evans, Christopher D/0000-0002-7052-354X; Emmett, Bridget A/0000-0002-2713-4389; Griffiths, Robert I/0000-0002-3341-4547; Robinson, David A/0000-0001-7290-4867",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/R016429/1],"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/R016429/1",,,0,0,25,47,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Life history traits, such as overwintering life stage, sex, and body size may influence solitary bee responses to climate change by mediating the effects of temperature on physiological processes spanning fall, winter, and spring. Yet, most studies assessing the effects of temperature on solitary bees have focused on managed species and have isolated the effects of winter temperature. Here, we reared male and female individuals representing eight cavity-nesting solitary bee species that overwinter either as adults (i.e., Osmia spp.) or prepupae (i.e., Megachile spp.). Eight rearing treatments were used, in which we manipulated fall and spring temperature, fall duration, and the timing of spring onset. We measured pre-emergence mortality, pre-emergence weight loss, emergence timing, and post-emergence lifespan. We found that Osmia spp. responded primarily to the timing of spring onset, whereas Megachile spp. responded primarily to spring temperature. Early-spring onset increased both pre-emergence mortality and pre-emergence weight loss and reduced post-emergence lifespan in Osmia spp. In addition, treatments caused unequal shifts in the timing of emergence between male and female Osmia spp. By contrast, warmer spring temperature decreased weight loss, and increased lifespan in Megachile spp. These findings suggest that Osmia spp. may be more vulnerable to negative fitness consequences of climate change compared to Megachile spp., and that climate change may have implications for population-level sex-ratios and mating success in species of Osmia. This work helps build a mechanistic understanding of how life histories may mediate solitary bee responses to climate change, and how these responses may impact solitary bee fitness and plant-bee interactions.",,,,,,Montana Academy of Science; Montana Institute on Ecosystems; Montana State University,"Montana Academy of Science, Montana Institute on Ecosystems, and Montana State University.",,,0,0,10,16,,,,2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Within these forests, the understorey is an important biodiversity reservoir that can influence ecosystem processes and functions in multiple ways. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of the relative importance of the understorey for temperate forest functioning. As a result, understoreys are often ignored during assessments of forest functioning and changes thereof under global change. We here compiled studies that quantify the relative importance of the understorey for temperate forest functioning, focussing on litter production, nutrient cycling, evapotranspiration, tree regeneration, pollination and pathogen dynamics. We describe the mechanisms driving understorey functioning and develop a conceptual framework synthesizing possible effects of multiple global change drivers on understorey-mediated forest ecosystem functioning. Our review illustrates that the understorey's contribution to temperate forest functioning is significant but varies depending on the ecosystem function and the environmental context, and more importantly, the characteristics of the overstorey. To predict changes in understorey functioning and its relative importance for temperate forest functioning under global change, we argue that a simultaneous investigation of both overstorey and understorey functional responses to global change will be crucial. Our review shows that such studies are still very scarce, only available for a limited set of ecosystem functions and limited to quantification, providing little data to forecast functional responses to global change.",,,,"Landuyt, Dries/E-6226-2013; De Frenne, Pieter/N-4969-2014; Perring, Michael/B-1323-2011","De Frenne, Pieter/0000-0002-8613-0943; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Blondeel, Haben/0000-0001-9939-5994; Perring, Michael/0000-0001-8553-4893; Landuyt, Dries/0000-0001-8107-5546","Fonds Wetenschappelijk OnderzoekFWO; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [614839, 757833]","Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; China Scholarship Council; H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 614839 and 757833",,,11,11,22,36,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

If a species is present at a site but does not vocalize during a scheduled audio recording survey, researchers may incorrectly conclude that the species is absent (""false negative""). The risk of false negatives is compounded when audio devices have sampling constraints, do not record continuously, and must be manually scheduled to operate at pre-selected times of day, particularly when research programs target multiple species with acoustic availability that varies across temporal conditions. We developed a temporally adaptive acoustic sampling algorithm to maximize detection probabilities for a suite of focal species amid sampling constraints. The algorithm combines user-supplied species vocalization models with site-specific weather forecasts to set an optimized sampling schedule for the following day. To test our algorithm, we simulated hourly vocalization probabilities for a suite of focal species in a hypothetical monitoring area for the year 2016. We conducted a factorial experiment that sampled from the 2016 acoustic environment to compare the probability of acoustic detection by a fixed (stationary) schedule versus a temporally adaptive optimized schedule under several sampling efforts and monitoring durations. We found that over the course of a study season, the probability of acoustically capturing a focal species (given presence) at least once via automated acoustic monitoring was greater (and acoustic capture occurred earlier in the season) when using the temporally adaptive optimized schedule as compared to a fixed schedule. The advantages of a temporally adaptive optimized acoustic sampling schedule are magnified when a study duration is short, sampling effort is low, and/or species acoustic availability is minimal. This methodology presents the opportunity to maximize acoustic monitoring sampling efforts amid constraints.",,,,,"Donovan, Therese/0000-0001-8124-9251; Balantic, Cathleen/0000-0003-2043-0975",NSF IGERT ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1144388]; U.S. Bureau of Land Management [31409],"NSF IGERT Program, Grant/Award Number: 1144388; U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Grant/Award Number: 31409",,,1,1,1,3,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Urban residents can actively participate in these activities, yet their contribution can also be realized as an electorate body able to influence the design of conservation programs according to their interests. Little is known, however about their preferences toward the objectives and design of international monarch conservation policies. In this paper, we investigate these preferences via a survey design using Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) and Latent Class Analysis (LC) of urban residents across the main eastern migratory flyway in Ontario, Canada, and the eastern United States. Attributes in the DCE included the size and trend of overwintering butterfly colonies, the type of institution leading the conservation program, international allocation of funds, and the percentage of funds dedicated to research. From the general populace, we isolated respondents already engaged in monarch conservation activities to explore how they compare. We sent a smaller set of surveys deliberately withholding the expected-success forecast of the monarch recovery program to assess the value of information for urban residents within a conservation context. The LC distinguished three groups of respondents among urban residents: (1) the main group, labeled ""Eager,"" accounting for 72.4% of the sample, that showed a high potential for supporting conservation policies and had remarkable similarities with the monarch enthusiasts' sample; (2) a ""Pro Nation"" group (18.4%) marked by their increased willingness to support conservation initiatives solely focused within their country of residence; and (3) an ""Opinionated"" segment (9.23%), that was highly reactive to changes of the leading institution, resources allocation, and economic contribution proposed. Key findings from this research reveal that to maximize potential support amongst urban residents in the monarch's breeding range, a conservation strategy for the monarch butterfly should be led by not-for-profit organizations, should strive for transboundary cooperation, and should include the communication of anticipated ecological outcomes.",,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant [31-639962]; National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Simon Fraser University Open Access Fund,"The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant (No. 31-639962), the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT), and the Simon Fraser University Open Access Fund provided the funding for this study.",,,0,0,7,11,,,,2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Here we combine a neighborhood modeling approach with insights from coexistence theory to assess the effects of temporal variation in species interactions and environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and understory light availability) on seedling survival over nine census years in a subtropical forest. We find significant temporal shifts in the magnitude of neighborhood effects on both community-wide and species-level seedling survival (statistically significant random effects of neighborhood x year and neighborhood x species x year interactions). These results are consistent with the idea that environmental change will play a fundamental role on forest regeneration dynamics by altering biotic interactions at the neighborhood scale. Moreover, differences among species in response to neighbors over time contribute to a pattern of temporal decoupling of seedling survival between species, which can help to promote diversity in certain contexts. In separate analyses of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), altered interactions with neighbors are much stronger predictors of asynchronous seedling survival among species than the pure effects of climate and plant functional traits, explaining twice as much variation (43.9% vs. 22.2%). In sum, these results reveal that divergent species responses to interannual environmental variability detected are driven primarily by indirect effects mediated by changing biotic environments. This highlights the importance of including indirect effects from local biotic (neighborhood) interactions in forecasts of forest community responses to global change.",,,,"Wang, Yunquan/O-6916-2019; Chen, Lei/C-3543-2012; Kraft, Nathan J.

To reconcile high-frequency covariates with lower-frequency demographic censuses, many statistical tools involve aggregating environmental conditions over long periods, potentially obscuring the importance of fluctuating conditions in driving mortality. Here, we introduce a flexible model designed to infer how survival probabilities depend on changing environmental covariates. Specifically, the model (1) quantifies effects of environmental covariates at a higher frequency than the census intervals, and (2) allows partitioning of environmental drivers of individual survival into acute (short-term) and chronic (accumulated) effects. By applying our method to a long-term observational data set of eight annual plant species, we show we can accurately infer daily survival probabilities as temperature and moisture levels change. Next, we show that a species' water use efficiency, known to mediate annual plant population dynamics, is positively correlated with the importance of ""chronic stress"" inferred by the model. This suggests that model parameters can reflect underlying physiological mechanisms. This method is also applicable to other binary responses (hatching, phenology) or systems (insects, nestlings).

We concurred that, to improve the translation of science into effective conservation for penguins, the scientific community and funding bodies must recognize the importance of and support long-term research; research on and conservation of penguins must expand its focus to include the nonbreeding season and juvenile stage; marine reserves must be designed at ecologically appropriate spatial and temporal scales; and communication between scientists and decision makers must be improved with the help of individual scientists and interdisciplinary working groups.",,,,"Seddon, Philip/G-8659-2011","Seddon, Philip/0000-0001-9076-9566",Deep Aquarium,,,,1,1,15,49,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

In northern Europe, forecasts propose lower annual spring flood peaks and higher winter flows, resulting in narrower riparian zones. To estimate the impact of climate change on habitat extent of riparian plants, we developed a framework estimating the sensitivity and exposure of individual species to streamflow change, and surveyed five reaches along the free-flowing Vindel River in northern Sweden. We modeled the hydrologic niche of riparian plant species based on the probability of occurrence along gradients of flood frequency and duration and used predicted future water-level fluctuations (based on climate models and IPCC emission scenarios) to calculate changes in flow-related habitat availability of individual species. Despite projected increases in runoff, we predict most species to decrease in riparian elevational extent by on average 12-29% until the end of the century, depending on scenario. Species growing in the upper, spring-flood-controlled part of the riparian zone will likely lose most habitat, with the largest reductions in species with narrow ranges of inundation duration tolerance (decreases of up to 54%). In contrast, the elevational extent of most amphibious species is predicted to increase, but conditions creating isoetid vegetation will become rarer or disappear: isoetid vegetation is presently found in areas where ice formed in the fall settles on the riverbank during the winter as water levels subside. Higher winter flows will make these conditions rare. We argue that our framework is useful to project the effects of hydrologic change caused by climate change as well as other stressors such as flow regulation also in other regions. With few rivers remaining unaffected by dams and other human stressors, these results call for monitoring to detect species declines. Management to alleviate species losses might include mitigation of habitat degradation from land-use activities, more environmentally friendly flow schemes, and more intensive management options such as mowing riparian meadows no longer regularly maintained by recurrent floods.",,,,"Nilsson, Christer/AAI-1354-2019",,Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for improving the manuscript with their comments.

At present, no system for prediction of fire occurrence risk based on fuel dryness conditions is available in Mexico. As part of an ongoing national-scale project, we developed an operational fire risk mapping tool based on satellite and weather information. Results We demonstrated how differing monthly temporal trends in a fuel greenness index, dead ratio (DR), and fire density (FDI) can be clearly differentiated by vegetation type and region for the whole country, using MODIS satellite observations for the period 2003 to 2014. We tested linear and non-linear models, including temporal autocorrelation terms, for prediction of FDI from DR for a total of 28 combinations of vegetation types and regions. In addition, we developed seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting DR values based on the last observed values. Most ARIMA models showed values of the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2 adj) above 0.7 to 0.8, suggesting potential to forecast fuel dryness and fire occurrence risk conditions. The best fitted models explained more than 70% of the observed FDI variation in the relation between monthly DR and fire density. Conclusion These results suggest that there is potential for the DR index to be incorporated in future fire risk operational tools. However, some vegetation types and regions show lower correlations between DR and observed fire density, suggesting that other variables, such as distance and timing of agricultural burn, deserve attention in future studies.",,,,"Lopez-Sanchez, Carlos A./K-6486-2016","Lopez-Sanchez, Carlos A./0000-0002-5135-5739; Alvarez-Gonzalez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-5206-9128",CONAFOR-CONACYT [252620]; Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria and European Social Fund,"Funding for this work was provided by CONAFOR-CONACYT Project 252620 ""Development of a Fire Danger System for Mexico.""

To quantify biodiversity patterns in such transformed landscapes, we use Hill numbers to analyse individual-based species abundance data or replicated, sample-based incidence data. Given biodiversity data from two distinct habitat types, when a specified proportion of original habitat is transformed, our approach utilises a proportional mixture of two within-habitat rarefaction/extrapolation curves to analytically predict biodiversity changes, with bootstrap confidence intervals to assess sampling uncertainty.

However, invader impacts are context-dependent, making reliable and robust predictions challenging. In particular, it is unclear how temporal variabilities in relation to temperature regime shifts influence invader ecological impacts. In the present study, we quantify the functional responses of three coexisting freshwater fishes: the native freshwater River Goby Glossogobius callidus, and the non-native Mozambique Tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus and Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, under two temperature treatments using chironomid larvae as prey. This was used along with fish abundance data to determine temporal differences in ecological impacts of each fish species between seasons (i.e. at two corresponding temperatures). All three fish species exhibited potentially population-destabilizing Type II functional responses. Their maximum feeding rates were consistently higher in the warm temperature treatment, whereas attack rates tended to be reduced. Non-native Mozambique Tilapia had the highest maximum feeding rate under both temperature treatments (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), followed by the non-native Western Mosquitofish and lastly the native River Goby, suggesting greater per capita impacts on native prey by non-native fishes. The predatory fish abundances differed significantly according to season, with native River Goby and non-native Mozambique Tilapia generally more abundant than non-native Western Mosquitofish. By multiplying functional response maximum feeding rates with abundances of each fish species across the seasonal gradient, the relative impact potential of non-native Mozambique Tilapia was consistently higher compared to that of native gobies. Western Mosquitofish impacts were less apparent, owing to their low abundances. We demonstrate how seasonal temperature fluctuations affect the relative impact capacities of introduced species and the utility of consumer functional response and the relative impact potential metric in impact forecasting.",,,,"Weyl, Olaf/B-8996-2009; Dalu, Tatenda/K-3089-2012","Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Dalu, Tatenda/0000-0002-9019-7702","Professional Development Programme Doctoral Scholarship; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (NRF) [101039]; CIB/DST Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (CIB); National Research Foundation - South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology (Inland Fisheries and Freshwater Ecology) [110507]; NRF [109015, 103581, 88746]; NRF-SAIAB Institutional Support system","This study forms part of a PhD research project supported by the Professional Development Programme Doctoral Scholarship with the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (NRF, Grant No. 101039), the CIB/DST Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (CIB) and the National Research Foundation - South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology (Inland Fisheries and Freshwater Ecology, Grant No. 110507) and NRF incentive funding (Grant Nos. 109015 to O.L.F.W., 103581 to D.J.W and 88746 to R.J.W).

For species with complex life histories, a mechanistic understanding of how climate affects different lifecycle stages may be crucial for making accurate forecasts. Here, we use mechanistic niche modeling (NicheMapR) to derive ""proximate"" (mechanistic) variables for tadpole, juvenile, and adult Rana temporaria. We modeled the hydroperiod, and maximum and minimum temperatures of shallow (30 cm) ponds, as well as activity windows for juveniles and adults. We then used those (""proximate"") variables in correlative ecological niche models (Maxent) to assess their role in limiting the species' current distribution, and to investigate the potential effects of climate change on R. temporaria across Europe. We further compared the results with a model based on commonly used macroclimatic (""distal"") layers (i.e., bioclimatic layers from WorldClim). The maximum temperature of the warmest month (a macroclimatic variable) and maximum pond temperatures (a mechanistic variable) were the most important range-limiting factors, and maximum temperature thresholds were consistent with the observed upper thermal limit of R. temporaria tadpoles. We found that range shift forecasts in central Europe are far more pessimistic when using distal macroclimatic variables, compared to projections based on proximate mechanistic variables. However, both approaches predicted extensive decreases in climatic suitability in southern Europe, which harbors a significant fraction of the species' genetic diversity. We show how mechanistic modeling provides ways to depict gridded layers that directly reflect the microenvironments experienced by organisms at continental scales, and to reconstruct those predictors without extrapolation under novel future conditions. Furthermore, incorporating those predictors in correlative ecological niche models can help shed light on range-limiting processes, and can have substantial impacts on predictions of climate-induced range shifts.",,,,"Gonzalez-Nicieza, Alfredo Cesar/L-6285-2014; Enriquez-Urzelai, Urtzi/H-9778-2016; Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Gonzalez-Nicieza, Alfredo Cesar/0000-0003-4062-569X; Enriquez-Urzelai, Urtzi/0000-0001-5958-2250; Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744","Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [BES-2013-063203, CGL2012-40246-C02-02, CGL2017-86924-P]; ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher AwardAustralian Research Council","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: BES-2013-063203, CGL2012-40246-C02-02 and CGL2017-86924-P; ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award",,,1,1,13,20,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

As part of the intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, we present a fine-resolution assessment of trends in the persistence of global plant biodiversity. We coupled generalized dissimilarity models, fitted to >52 million records of >254 thousand plant species, with the species-area relationship, to estimate the effect of land-use and climate change on global biodiversity persistence. We estimated that the number of plant species committed to extinction over the long term has increased by 60% globally between 1900 and 2015 (from similar to 10,000 to similar to 16,000). This number is projected to decrease slightly by 2050 under the most optimistic scenario of land-use change and to substantially increase (to similar to 18,000) under the most pessimistic scenario. This means that, in the absence of climate change, scenarios of sustainable socio-economic development can potentially bring extinction risk back to pre-2000 levels. Alarmingly, under all scenarios, the additional impact from climate change might largely surpass that of land- use change. In this case, the estimated number of species committed to extinction increases by 3.7-4.5 times compared to landuse-only projections. African regions (especially central and southern) are expected to suffer some of the highest impacts into the future, while biodiversity decline in Southeast Asia (which has previously been among the highest globally) is projected to slow down. Our results suggest that environmentally sustainable land-use planning alone might not be sufficient to prevent potentially dramatic biodiversity loss, unless a stabilization of climate to pre-industrial times is observed.",,,,"Di Marco, Moreno/J-4285-2012","Di Marco, Moreno/0000-0002-8902-4193",EU H2020 programme [H2020-MSCA-IF-2017-793212],We thank the PREDICTS team (Natural History Museum and UNEP-WCMC) for providing land-use conversion coefficients used in our analysis.

It has been postulated that the wide-spread of dengue be due to climate change and increased exposure following the increasing human population in the affected regions. Climate change impacts on ecosystem have also set a critical role in the unpredictability of vector breeding behavior. A compelling strategy in the modeling of dengue outbreak must therefore integrate climate factors inasmuch as they determinedly govern incidence patterns. The aim of this paper is to construct a clustering integrated multiple regression model for predicting dengue incidence rate based on incidence, rainfall, and humidity data, which renders early warning information. The data used were dengue incidence data in Jakarta obtained from Jakarta Health Office and meteorological data from Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) in the period 2008-2016, defined on weekly basis. Cross-correlation was used to determine the interrelationship between dengue, rainfall, and relative humidity in Jakarta. Further improvement of the model was done by instrumenting the accumulated preceding one-month dengue incidence as an additional correction term in the model. The best fittings in terms of outbreak catchment and minimal mean squared error were obtained from the model variants involving the accumulated original and logarithm of the incidence rates respectively. Both the historical incidence rate locale and centroids of the meteorological data related to the clustering as well as the accumulated incidence rate serve as the key determinant for the upcoming incidence rate. An optimal clustering was determined in a way that the mean squared error achieves its foremost minimum, which almost coincides with the division into tertiles. These clustering strategies can be utilized to provide a more accurate forecast of the ominous dengue incidence for a few weeks' lead-time.",,,,"Fakhruddin, Muhammad/AAM-3678-2020","Fakhruddin, Muhammad/0000-0002-6928-0878; indratno, sapto/0000-0003-0739-5757; Satyaningsih, Ratna/0000-0002-9707-9063; Sopaheluwakan, Ardhasena/0000-0002-4532-854X; Goetz, Thomas/0000-0001-6083-0602","Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (Ristekdikti) through PMDSU program [1511/E4.4/2015]; ITB research grant 2018 [324p/I1.C01/PL/2018]; WCU ITB [386/SK/I1.B02/2018]","This work was supported by Indonesian Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (Ristekdikti) through PMDSU program [grant no. 1511/E4.4/2015], ITB research grant 2018 [grant no. 324p/I1.C01/PL/2018], and WCU ITB [grant no. 386/SK/I1.B02/2018].",,,0,0,1,1,,,,1476-945X,1476-9840,,ECOL COMPLEX,Ecol.

Stomatal regulation is a major plant control over leaf gas exchange, and the response to the increasing CO2 will shape the biological activity of forests in the future. Here, we collected 144 records from 57 species on stomatal conductance in CO2 manipulation experiments on trees (340-980 ppm CO2). CO2-induced stomatal downregulation was calculated as the slope of the linear regression between stomatal conductance and [CO2]. Among tree species, the slope (a) of change in stomatal conductance per 100 ppm CO(2 )increase ranged between 0 and -151, indicating stomatal downregulation, and only four species showed upregulation. There was a significant divergence between evergreen gymnosperms (a = -3.6 +/- 1.0), deciduous angiosperms (a = -16.3 +/- 3.1) and evergreen angiosperms (a = -32.8 +/- 7.1). Gymnosperms were less sensitive to CO2 changes than deciduous angiosperms even when considering only field experiments. The significant role of tree functional group in predicting CO2-induced stomatal downregulation was detected in multiple mixed-effect models, with p values ranging between 0.0002 and 0.0295. The significantly higher stomatal sensitivity to CO2 of angiosperms versus gymnosperms might be related to the overall higher stomatal conductance of angiosperms; their thinner leaves, in turn losing water faster; and the decreasing atmospheric [CO2] at the time of their taxa diversification. We conclude that species differences must be taken into account in forecasting future forest fluxes. A plain language summary is available for this article.",,,,,,Merle S.

Most such studies come from landscapes covered by large areas of natural habitat and without a long history of intense human modification. However, much of Europe consists of human-dominated landscapes, where biodiversity responses to land sparing may differ. To test this, we use estimates of bird population density in different (semi-)natural habitats, and forecasts of population density in farmland habitat, to assess the future consequences for birds of land-sparing scenarios in the United Kingdom. Our scenarios predict that whilst up to 18 of the 156 species assessed (predominantly farmland associated species) might decline in UK conservation status under land sparing, up to 35 UK bird species (mainly woodland and wetland species) might improve in status. This contrasts with a maximum of eight species likely to improve in conservation status without land sparing, with up to seven species deteriorating. Combining land sparing with demand management measures (reducing food waste and the consumption of animal products) led to more positive population changes under all scenarios. Synthesis and applications. Land sparing has the potential to benefit UK bird populations in aggregate but would likely have negative impacts on farmland bird species. These findings are likely to be applicable across human-dominated landscapes beyond the UK, though effects on other taxa, implementation mechanisms and the sustainability of higher yields all require careful consideration.",,,,,"Balmford, Andrew/0000-0002-0144-3589",,,,,1,1,16,30,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Forecasting and managing the impact of pests and pesticides on crop production is challenging. Since pest control tactics not only affect the target pest, but also initiate feedbacks within the field community, proper modelling of pest management requires functions in at least two trophic levels. To respond to this challenge, we integrated a process-based insect population dynamics model and a process-based crop model. The coupled model was then used to simulate eight field trials on five different sites across the US, testing the efficacy of five different pesticides against six different pests as well as the yield response. The results showed that the model performed robustly on different sites (five plots across the US) and under different climatic conditions (8 years spanning a period from 1985 to 2014). For armyworm and black cutworm, the simulated yields per hectare, the number of insects per plant and the response to insecticide treatments closely matched the reported numbers. For the European corn borer, the number of insects per plant differed slightly between simulated and field data, but the response to the insecticide treatment showed an adequate match. Simulations for the bean leaf beetle and stalk borer yielded similar results. The comparison between simulated and measured adult potato leafhopper numbers revealed that even though numbers did not match exactly in two of three years, they were in the same range, and the measured and simulated impacts were almost identical for all three used insecticides. Synthesis and applications. The novel coupled crop-insect model EPIC-GILSYM realistically simulates two trophic levels (insects and plants), their interactions, and the effect crop management has on both levels. It has been successfully tested against field trial data collected in eight different years on five plots in different parts of the US. With careful calibration and validation to other sites and climates, it may become a valuable tool in the assessment of insect pest impacts and appropriate control measures.",,,,,,the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [RA 2994/2-1],"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under grant RA 2994/2-1 and the cluster of excellence ""Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction' (CliSAP) at Universitat Hamburg.",,,2,2,8,11,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

However, they rarely include the diversity of individual responses to environmental changes, thus hampering our understanding of demographic mechanisms. We develop an integrated integral projection model (IPM2) that is a combination of an integrated population model (IPMpop) and an integral projection model (IPMind). IPM2 includes interactions between environmental and individual effects on demographic rates and can forecast both population size and individual trait distributions. First, we study the performance of this model using eight simulated scenarios with variable reproductive selective pressures on an individual trait. When the individual trait interacts with the environmental variable and the selective pressure on the individual trait is nonlinear, only IPM2 produces adequate predictions, because IPMind does not link predictions between the population level and observed data and because IPMpop does not include the individual trait. Second, we apply IPM2 to a population of barn swallows. The model accurately predicts trends of the barn swallow population while also providing mechanistic insights. High precipitation negatively influenced population dynamics through delaying laying dates, which lowered reproductive and survival rates. To predict the future of populations, we need to understand their individual drivers and thus include individual responses to their environment while following the entire population. As a consequence, IPM2 will improve our ability to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses and improve the accuracy of population forecasting to aid management programs.",,,,,"Gruebler, Martin U./0000-0003-4468-8292",,,,,3,3,10,18,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, there has been little exploration of how resource requirements depend on other environmental factors, including temperature. Changes in resource requirements as influenced by environmental temperature would imply that climate warming can alter the outcomes of competition and community assembly. We experimentally demonstrate that environmental temperature alters the minimum light and nitrogen requirements - as well as other growth parameters - of six widespread phytoplankton species from distinct taxonomic groups. We found that species require the most nitrogen at the highest temperatures while light requirements tend to be lowest at intermediate temperatures, although there are substantial interspecific differences in the exact shape of this relationship. We also experimentally parameterize two competition models, which we use to illustrate how temperature, through its effects on species' traits, alters competitive hierarchies in multispecies assemblages, determining community dynamics.

Extreme heat events in Australia are known to kill thousands of flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.), and such die-offs are expected to become more frequent and widespread in the future under anthropogenic climate change. There is a growing need for predicting when and where such heat-related die-offs would occur, to facilitate short-term wildlife management and conservation actions. In this study, we used gridded hourly air temperature forecasts [Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS-R) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model] from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to predict flying-fox heat-related mortality based on an empirically determined threshold of 42.0 degrees C. We tested the accuracy and precision of this model using a twofold evaluation of the ACCESS-R NWP forecast air temperature during a recorded extreme heat event with in situ air temperature measurements and interpolated weather station data. While our results showed a slight discrepancy between the modelled and measured air temperatures, there was no significant difference in the forecast's accuracy to predict die-offs during an extreme heat event and the overall summer period. We evaluated the accuracy of mortality predictions based on different air temperature thresholds (38.0, 40.0, 42.0 and 44.0 degrees C). Our results revealed a significant probability of flying-fox mortality occurrence when forecast air temperature was >= 42.0 degrees C, while the 24- and 48-h forecasts accurately predicted 77 and 73% of the die-offs, respectively. Thus, the use of 42.0 degrees C forecast air temperature from the ACCESS-R NWP model can predict flying-fox mortality reliably at the landscape scale. In principle, the forecaster can be used for any species with known thermal tolerance data and is therefore a promising new tool for prioritizing adaptation actions that aim to conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change.",,,,"Karoly, David/C-8262-2011; Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Karoly, David/0000-0002-8671-2994; Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744",,,,,4,4,9,22,,,,1367-9430,1469-1795,,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

In these ecosystems, the brevity of optimal breeding conditions means species must efficiently track spatiotemporal variations in resources in order to synchronise their reproductive effort with peaks in food availability. Understanding the details of prey-habitat associations and their seasonality in such ecosystems is thus key for deciphering species' ecological niches and developing sound conservation action. However, the ecological requirements of high-alpine avifauna remain poorly documented. Furthermore, mountain ranges in the Old World are affected not only by profound alterations of climate, but also by changes in land-use, the interaction of which hampers both proper forecasting of species' resilience to environmental change and delivery of evidence-based conservation guidance. Here, we investigate the prey-habitat associations of a high-alpine passerine, the White-winged Snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), by radio-tracking breeding adults in the Swiss Alps. In late spring and early summer, Snowfinches foraged preferentially next to invertebrate-rich, melting snow patches where Tipulidae larvae abound. Later, in mid-summer, they favoured flower-rich alpine meadows. When foraging, they always preferred short ground vegetation while avoiding rock and scree. Their pattern of foraging habitat selection reflects trade-offs between food abundance and accessibility, i.e. prey availability. The reliance of this passerine on a habitat mosaic where snow plays a major role questions its ability to cope with climate change due to future habitat loss and potential phenological mismatches. Targeted grazing could possibly help in habitat management by aiming at maintaining invertebrate-rich meadows with short vegetation. Yet, it remains an open question whether habitat management would suffice to compensate for the potentially detrimental effects of the progressive retreat of snow fields to higher elevations.",,,,"Barras, Arnaud Gian/AAE-9614-2020; Braunisch, Veronika/AAH-8260-2020; Resano Mayor, Jaime/L-3069-2017","Barras, Arnaud Gian/0000-0003-0850-6965; Braunisch, Veronika/0000-0001-7035-4662; Resano Mayor, Jaime/0000-0002-0962-6873",,,,,3,3,12,23,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

In particular, the parameters of attack rate a and handling time h may be predictive of the ecological impacts of invaders when utilised in comparison with trophically analogous natives. However, researchers in many cases face somewhat contradictory impact predictions based on the use of one parameter or the other. Here, we thus propose a new metric, the Functional Response Ratio (FRR), which is simply a divided by h: that is, FRR=a/h. Given that high values of a and low values of h should associate with high impact, and vice versa, the FRR metric balances the information from both parameters. This also resolves contradictions when one parameter gives opposite predictions to the other. Using multiple examples obtained from the literature, we find that the FRR indeed resolves such contradictions and that values of FRR of invaders are consistently higher than those of natives, irrespective of experimental or environmental context. Accordingly, the use of FRR provides a novel and reliable metric for scientists, stakeholders and practitioners to predict the ecological impacts of existing, emerging and future invasive alien species across taxa and trophic groups.",,,,,"Joyce, Patrick/0000-0003-1058-7901","Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland; Inland Fisheries Ireland; Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Northern Ireland; Irish Environmental Protection Agency [2015-NCMS-4]","RNC and PWSJ acknowledge funding from the Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland.

Using a choice experiment approach, the study introduced a hypothetical package of improved climate services to 600 randomly selected smallholder farmers in three districts across three different agro-ecological zones in the Oromia Regional State. A generalized multi-nomial logit (G-MNL) model was used to estimate preferred attributes of climate services and willingness-to-pay (WTP) values. The results show that the preferred bundle of improved climate services among smallholder farmers was one that could be communicated in short text message system, provided along with credit facility, and market information and one that favors participatory decision making by smallholders. The results further reveal that the WTP value exhibited high implicit price for participatory decision-making. The study sheds light on important characteristics of agricultural climate services that may improve their acceptability and usability among smallholders. It also highlights the importance of packaging additional services including digital and ICT-based solutions, financial and market information along with climate services to promote demand-driven last mile delivery systems.

Six successive examinations of spp. presence/absence on 20 x 20 cm quadrats located along permanent transects in a Scots pine boreal forest were initiated in 1980, 26 years after a forest fire in 1954, and repeated in every 5 years, thus scoping the 25 years of post-fire succession (Maslov, 1989). Those data have provided the exact calibration of 5 one-step transition matrices forming a nonautonomous Markov-chain model. Its basic prediction (forward forecast) has been obtained as the limiting distribution of states generated by the geometric average of transition matrices featured increase in the share species coexistence. Presented in this paper, the alternate modes of prediction are the validation forecast and the backward prediction. The former is implemented as the geometric average of the first 4 one-step matrices and its dominant eigenvector as the limiting distribution of quadrate states. It appears to hit a 5% vicinity of the distribution observed in 2005, thus certifying a success of model validation. As regards the backward prediction, I propose a technique that realizes the idea of backward prediction by means of reversing the time dimension in the observation data. The ensuing formula for the average backward transition matrix looks somewhat different from that for the forward one but enables calculating the matrix as reliable as the forward formula does. Although the 1955 distribution back-predicted from the observed 1980 one cannot be quantitatively interpreted as a community that might form just 1 year after the fire, it does qualitatively confirm (together with the backward limiting distribution) the directionality revealed earlier in the forward dynamics.",,,,,"Logofet, Dmitrii/0000-0001-5229-6534",,,,,0,0,2,4,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are typically based on correlations between species occurrence data and environmental predictors, with ecological processes captured only implicitly. However, there is a growing interest in approaches that explicitly model processes such as physiology, dispersal, demography and biotic interactions. These models are believed to offer more robust predictions, particularly when extrapolating to novel conditions. Many process-explicit approaches are now available, but it is not clear how we can best draw on this expanded modelling toolbox to address ecological problems and inform management decisions. Here, we review a range of process-explicit models to determine their strengths and limitations, as well as their current use. Focusing on four common applications of SDMs - regulatory planning, extinction risk, climate refugia and invasive species - we then explore which models best meet management needs. We identify barriers to more widespread and effective use of process-explicit models and outline how these might be overcome.

The measured data included 110 dryland soils globally distributed and two continental to global-scale cross-biome datasets. Model-data comparisons suggested that a positive CUE-MAT relationship best predicts the measured mass-specific soil heterotrophic respiration rates in soils distributed globally. These results are robust when considering models of increasing complexity and competing mechanisms driving soil heterotrophic respiration-MAT relationships (e.g., carbon substrate availability). Our findings suggest that a warmer climate selects for microbial communities with higher CUE, as opposed to the often hypothesized reductions in CUE by warming based on soil laboratory assays.

Accurate climate change forecasts, therefore, depend on a reliable representation of mechanisms governing Arctic carbon cycle processes, but this task is complicated by the complex interaction of multiple controls on Arctic ecosystem changes, linked through both positive and negative feedbacks. As a primary example, predicted Arctic warming can be substantially influenced by shifts in hydrologic regimes, linked to, for example, altered precipitation patterns or changes in topography following permafrost degradation. This study presents observational evidence how severe drainage, a scenario that may affect large Arctic areas with ice-rich permafrost soils under future climate change, affects biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes within an Arctic floodplain. Our in situ data demonstrate reduced carbon losses and transfer of sensible heat to the atmosphere, and effects linked to drainage-induced long-term shifts in vegetation communities and soil thermal regimes largely counterbalanced the immediate drainage impact. Moreover, higher surface albedo in combination with low thermal conductivity cooled the permafrost soils. Accordingly, long-term drainage effects linked to warming-induced permafrost degradation hold the potential to alleviate positive feedbacks between permafrost carbon and Arctic warming, and to slow down permafrost degradation. Self-stabilizing effects associated with ecosystem disturbance such as these drainage impacts are a key factor for predicting future feedbacks between Arctic permafrost and climate change, and, thus, neglect of these mechanisms will exaggerate the impacts of Arctic change on future global climate projections.",,,,"Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016; Goeckede, Mathias/C-1027-2017","Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113; Goeckede, Mathias/0000-0003-2833-8401; Zimov, Sergey/0000-0002-0053-6599; Kwon, Min Jung/0000-0002-7330-2320","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [727890, 773421]; AXA Research Fund [PDOC_2012_W2]; Seventh Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU) [282700, PCIG12-GA-201-333796]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [03G0836G, 03F0764D]","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 727890 and 773421; AXA Research Fund, Grant/Award Number: PDOC_2012_W2; Seventh Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 282700 and PCIG12-GA-201-333796; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 03G0836G and 03F0764D",,,1,1,11,20,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The simulated population dynamics was calibrated and validated against the historical trend in hindcasting. Forecasting simulations were also conducted and validated to examine the effectiveness in the context of uncertainty. Hindcasting results suggested that the calibrated MSE framework could capture the stock dynamics assuming different recruitment dynamics indicated by residuals lower than 5%. Forecasting stochastic runs demonstrated a minor disparity between management effects of fishing-mortality-based and catch-based HCRs when the segregated stock recruitment relationship was adopted with a difference in simulated spawning stock biomass lower than 10%.

In this paper, a model that estimates the conditions where an abnormal growth of algae in reservoirs and lakes takes place is built. This method combines artificial bee colony and support vector machines algorithms to predict the eutrophication taking into account physical-chemical and biological data sampled in the Englishmen Lake and posterior analysis in a laboratory. The support vector machines parameters are tuned by means of the artificial bee colony algorithm, improving the accuracy of the procedure.

However, whether or not (and how fast) such range shifts occur depends on species' dispersal capacities. In most ecological studies, dispersal-related traits (such as the wing size or wing loading in insects) are treated as fixed, species-specific characteristics, ignoring the important role of phenotypic plasticity during insect development. We tested the hypothesis that dispersal-related traits themselves vary in dependence of ambient environmental conditions (temperature regimes, discharge patterns and biotic interactions during individual development). We collected data over 8 years from a natural population of the crane fly Tipula maxima in central Germany. Using linear mixed-effect models, we analysed how phenotypic traits, phenological characteristics and population densities are affected by environmental conditions during the preceding 3, 6 and 12 months. We found a moderate (5.6%) increase in wing length per 1 degrees C increase in mean annual temperatures during the previous year. At the same time, body weight increased by as much as 17.8% in females and 26.9% in males per 1 degrees C, likely driven by increased habitat productivity, which resulted in a 16.4% (female) and 19.3% (male) increased wing loading. We further found a shorter, more synchronized emergence period (i.e. a narrower time frame for dispersal) with increasing temperatures. Altogether, our results suggest that dispersal abilities of T. maxima were negatively affected by elevated temperatures, and we discuss how similar patterns might affect the persistence of populations of other aquatic insects, especially stenoecious taxa with narrow distribution ranges. Our study calls for integration of information on temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of dispersal-related traits into models forecasting range shifts in the face of climate change. Furthermore, the patterns reported here are likely to affect metapopulation dynamics of aquatic insects under climate change conditions and may contribute to the ongoing decline of insect biomass and diversity.",,,,"Jourdan, Jonas/Y-7389-2018","Jourdan, Jonas/0000-0002-2745-2520; Baranov, Viktor/0000-0003-1893-3215; Plath, Martin/0000-0002-7827-615X","Talent Support Funding of Shaanxi Province [Z111021403, Z111021501]","Talent Support Funding of Shaanxi Province, Grant/Award Number: Z111021403 and Z111021501",,,1,1,8,21,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Determining the habitat suitability of a mobile pelagic species, such as blue marlin (BUM) Makaira nigricans and black marlin (BAM) Istiompax indica, can help describe their spatiotemporal distribution patterns over a broad spatial scale, which is crucial for fisheries management. We applied a species distribution model (MaxEnt) to model the dynamic suitable habitat of BUM and BAM using 14 yr (1997-2010) of Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission occurrence data (n = 20 348) from purse-seine vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) and high-resolution remotely sensed oceanographic data. The spatial distribution of suitable habitat for both species varied seasonally and in response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with BUM positively correlated with chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations and sea surface temperature and BAM with chl a concentrations and sea surface height. The influence of these environmental variables shifted seasonally suitable habitat between coastal (winter and spring) and oceanic (summer and fall) waters. During La Nina events, suitable habitat was along the equator, while during El Nino, suitable habitat shifted to farther northern and southern waters of the EPO. Analyses on species' centers of suitable habitat (CSH) revealed that the strength of ENSO did not influence CSH; however, large displacements were observed during these events.

Whereas a reliable resource is abundant on average and with limited variation in time and space, masting is volatile and localized, and that variability ramifies throughout food-webs. Theory is developed to evaluate how the space-time structure of masting interacts with consumers who exploit alternative hosts, forage widely in space, and store reserves in time. We derive the space-time-species covariance in resource supply and combine it with the space-time-diet breadth of consumers, or ambit. Direct connection to data is made possible with Mast Inference and Forecasting (MASTIF), a state-space autoregressive model that fits seed-trap and canopy observations and predicts resource availability within the canopy and on the forest floor with full uncertainty. A resource score can be assigned to each consumer-habitat combination that integrates the benefits of a high mean supply weighed against the variance cost. As the consumer ambit increases, the volatility of an unreliable resource shifts from a variance cost to a mean benefit. Consumers foraging in the canopy (arboreal arthropods and rodents, song birds) experience space-time covariance between host trees. Consumers on the forest floor (seed and damping-off fungi, arthropods, rodents, ground-nesting birds, mammals) experience instead a redistribution of that covariance by dispersal. For consumers lacking mobility, demographic storage in the form of episodic birth cohorts following mast years is important for population persistence. Consumers additionally compensate volatility with diet breadth. Depending on the dominant masting strategies of host tree species in the diet, habitats differentially limit consumers depending on the misalignment between consumer ambit and spatiotemporal covariance of hosts. The impact of adding or subtracting a diet item can be gauged with the standard error (SE) rule or the benefit of an added diet item balanced against the variance cost, both of which depend on the existing diet, the abundance of the new host, and the consumer's foraging ambit. Results rank habitats by their capacities to support wildlife and other consumers from a resource perspective.

In this study, we tested whether P x E is considered in climate change studies. Specifically, we evaluated whether population differentiation varies across environments and whether P x E is determined by aspects of the study system and experimental design. Location Global. Methods We conducted a literature search in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database to identify studies assessing population differentiation in a climate change context. We quantified the occurrence of P x E and performed a meta-analysis to calculate the percentage of traits showing P x E in the study cases. Results We identified 309 study cases (from 237 published articles) assessing population differentiation in 172 plant species, of which 64% included more than one test environment and tested P x E. In 77% of these studies, P x E was significant for at least one functional trait. The overall proportion of traits showing P x E was 33.4% (95% confidence interval 27.7-39.3). These results were generally consistent across life-forms, ecoregions and type of experiment. Furthermore, population differentiation varied across test environments in 76% of cases. The overall proportion of traits showing environment-dependent population differentiation was 53.7% (95% confidence interval 37.9-69.3). Conclusions Our findings revealed that differences in phenotypic plasticity among populations are common but are usually neglected in order to forecast population responses to climate change. Future studies should assess population differentiation in many test environments (accounting for P x E) that realistically reflect future environmental conditions, assessing climate change drivers that are rarely considered (e.g., multifactor experiments incorporating higher CO2 levels). Our review also revealed the predominant focus of population studies on trees from temperate climates, identifying underexplored life-forms (shrubs, annuals), phylogenetic groups (ferns, ancient gymnosperms) and ecoregions (tropical, arctic) that should receive more attention in future.",,,,"Matesanz, Silvia/L-5153-2014","Matesanz, Silvia/0000-0003-0060-6136","Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion [CGL2016-75566-P]","Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: CGL2016-75566-P",,,3,3,21,41,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

However, in the Anthropocene, a number of local-scale anthropogenic variables, including wildfire history, land-use change, invasive species, and ecological restoration practices can override regional-scale variables to drive patterns of species distribution. Incorporating these human-induced factors into SDMs remains a major research challenge, in part because spatial variability in these factors occurs at fine scales, rendering prediction over regional extents problematic. Here, we used big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) as a model species to explore whether including human-induced factors improves the fit of the SDM. We applied a Bayesian hurdle spatial approach using 21,753 data points of field-sampled vegetation obtained from the LANDFIRE program to model sagebrush occurrence and cover by incorporating fire history metrics and restoration treatments from 1980 to 2015 throughout the Great Basin of North America. Models including fire attributes and restoration treatments performed better than those including only climate and topographic variables. Number of fires and fire occurrence had the strongest relative effects on big sagebrush occurrence and cover, respectively. The models predicted that the probability of big sagebrush occurrence decreases by 1.2% (95% CI: -6.9%, 0.6%) when one fire occurs and cover decreases by 44.7% (95% CI: -47.9%, -41.3%) if at least one fire occurred over the 36 year period of record. Restoration practices increased the probability of big sagebrush occurrence but had minimal effect on cover. Our results demonstrate the potential value of including disturbance and land management along with climate in models to predict species distributions. As an increasing number of datasets representing land-use history become available, we anticipate that our modeling framework will have broad relevance across a range of biomes and species.",,,,,"Requena-Mullor, Juan Miguel/0000-0002-5120-7947; Caughlin, T.

The complex, and often context-dependent nature, of microclimate utilization has been an impediment to the advancement of general predictive models. Here, we overcome this impediment and estimate the potential impact of warming on the fitness of ectotherms using a benefit/cost trade-off derived from the simple and broadly documented thermal performance curve and a generalized cost function. Our framework reveals that, for certain environments, the cost of behavioral thermoregulation can be reduced as warming occurs, enabling behavioral buffering (e.g., the capacity for behavior to ameliorate detrimental impacts) and ""behavioral rescue"" from extinction in extreme cases. By applying our framework to operative temperature and physiological data collected at an extremely fine spatial scale in an African lizard, we show that new behavioral opportunities may emerge. Finally, we explore large-scale geographic differences in the impact of behavior on climate-impact projections using a global dataset of 38 insect species.

These freeze events-often called false springs-are one of the strongest factors determining temperate plants species range limits and can impose high ecological and economic damage. As climate change may alter the prevalence and severity of false springs, our ability to forecast such events has become more critical, and it has led to a growing body of research. Many false spring studies largely simplify the myriad complexities involved in assessing false spring risks and damage. While these studies have helped advance the field and may provide useful estimates at large scales, studies at the individual to community levels must integrate more complexity for accurate predictions of plant damage from late spring freezes. Here, we review current metrics of false spring, and how, when, and where plants are most at risk of freeze damage. We highlight how life stage, functional group, species differences in morphology and phenology, and regional climatic differences contribute to the damage potential of false springs. More studies aimed at understanding relationships among species tolerance and avoidance strategies, climatic regimes, and the environmental cues that underlie spring phenology would improve predictions at all biological levels.

Yet because species vary in how they respond to habitat conversion, ecological communities in agriculture and more natural habitats are often distinct. Unpacking the heterogeneity in species responses to habitat conversion will be essential for predicting and mitigating community shifts. Here, we analyze two years of bird censuses at 150 sites across gradients of local land cover, landscape forest amount and configuration, and regional precipitation in Costa Rica to holistically characterize species responses to habitat conversion. Specifically, we used Poisson-binomial mixture models to (1) delineate groups of species that respond similarly to environmental gradients, (2) explore the relative importance of local vs. landscape-level habitat conversion, and (3) determine how landscape context influences species' local habitat preferences. We found that species fell into six groups: habitat generalists, abundant and rare forest specialists, and three groups of agricultural specialists that differed in their responses to landscape forest cover, fragmentation, and regional precipitation. Birds were most sensitive to local forest cover, but responses were contingent on landscape context. Specifically, forest specialists benefitted most when local forest cover increased in forested landscapes, while habitat generalists exhibited compensatory dynamics, peaking at sites with either local or landscape-level forest, but not both. Our study demonstrates that species responses to habitat conversion are complex but predictable.

Given their spatial configuration, alpine areas have been traditionally seen as islands surrounded by an ""ocean"" of unsuitable lands. A quantitative assessment of the effects of Holocene climate fluctuations on islands area and inter-island connectivity is crucial to finely reconstruct past biodiversity dynamics and forecast species responses to future changes. Location Italy. Taxa Carabidae (Ground beetles), Chrysomelidae (Leaf beetles), Elateridae (Click beetles), Orthoptera (Grasshoppers and Crickets) and Papilionoidea (Butterflies and Skippers). Methods A total of 1,077 species for 128,093 records were analysed and a classification based on their functional traits allowed identifying groups of good and poor dispersers within each taxon. A dynamic discrete model of ecosystem evolution provided the spatio-temporal context to test two competing (transient equilibria vs. nonequilibrium) dynamics based on different colonization capabilities. In the transient equilibria dynamic the species are able to respond to island evolution through successful dispersal and colonization events, whereas in the nonequilibrium dynamic ineffective immigration constrains the current species richness to that generated by the strongest island contraction. Results With the exception of Elateridae, good dispersers (Chrysomelidae and Papilionoidea) responded to environmental changes by establishing a series of transient equilibria. In contrast, the nonequilibrium dynamic better described patterns of species richness in poor dispersers (Carabidae and Orthoptera).

Central to adaptive radiation is the association between a diversifying lineage and the evolution of phenotypic variation that facilitates the use of new environments or resources. However, is not clear whether adaptive evolution or historical contingency is more important for the origin of key phenotypic traits in adaptive radiation. Here we use targeted sequencing of >250,000 loci across 46 species to examine hypotheses concerning the origin and diversification of key traits in the adaptive radiation of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. Contrary to expectations of adaptive evolution, we show that notothenioids experienced a punctuated burst of genomic diversification and evolved key skeletal modifications before the onset of polar conditions in the Southern Ocean. We show that diversifying selection in pathways associated with human skeletal dysplasias facilitates ecologically important variation in buoyancy among Antarctic notothenioid species, and demonstrate the sufficiency of altered trip11, col1a2 and col1a1a function in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to phenocopy skeletal reduction in Antarctic notothenioids. Rather than adaptation being driven by the cooling of the Antarctic, our results highlight the role of historical contingency in shaping the adaptive radiation of notothenioids.

Phylogeographic structure and evolutionary significant units (ESU) have been proposed as pragmatic proxies to incorporate intraspecific differentiation in SDMs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of using these proxies in SDMs has been poorly investigated. We analysed how the projections of current and future climatically suitable areas can be affected when using ESU-based or lineage-based models compared to a species-level model. Location West-Palaearctic region. Methods As examples, we used three bumblebee species (133,787 observations). We assessed potential climatic niche differentiation between species level, lineages and ESUs, by determining the niche position and niche breadth for each classification level by outlying mean index analyses. Subsequently, we developed SDMs for each species and classification level separately using boosted regression trees prior to a comparison of their performances. Finally, we used the alternative models to project the extent of climatically suitable areas in 2070. Results We found that in spite of highly similar overall model accuracy, integrating intraspecific variability significantly increases model sensitivity (i.e., better predicting presences) while decreased model specificity (i.e., over-predicting the range). Consequently, both predictions of current and projections of future suitable conditions differed among the three approaches. Main conclusions We showed that although integrating lineage or ESU information did not improve the accuracy of conventional species-level SDMs, it led to considerably different conclusions. As SDM-based climatic risk assessments are increasingly used to help and improve conservation plans, divergences and limitations of each modelling approach should be taken into account for developing efficient biodiversity management strategies.

Allelic diversity, however, can also provide complementary and useful information for conservation programmes, as it is highly sensitive to population bottlenecks, and is more related to long-term selection response than heterozygosity. Here we present a completely revised and updated re-implementation of the software metapop for the analysis of diversity in subdivided populations, as well as a tool for the management and dynamic estimation of optimal contributions in conservation programmes. This new update includes computation of allelic diversity for population analysis and management, as well as a simulation mode to forecast the consequences of taking different management strategies over time. Furthermore, the new implementation in C++ includes code optimization and improved memory usage, allowing for fast analysis of large data sets including single nucleotide polymorphism markers, as well as enhanced cross-software and cross-platform compatibility.",,,,"Cortegano, Eugenio Lopez/G-7744-2019; Perez-Figueroa, Andres/A-7503-2008; Caballero, Armando/H-5358-2015","Cortegano, Eugenio Lopez/0000-0001-6914-6305; Perez-Figueroa, Andres/0000-0002-7722-3697; Caballero, Armando/0000-0001-7391-6974","Excellence in Research (INUGA) Program from the Regional Council of Culture, Education and Universities; European Union through the ERDF Operational Program Galicia 2014-2020; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de Galicia [ED431C 2016-037]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) [CGL2016-75904-C2-1-P]; Fondos Feder: ""Unha maneira de facer Europa","UVigo Marine Research Centre funded by the ""Excellence in Research (INUGA)"" Program from the Regional Council of Culture, Education and Universities; European Union through the ERDF Operational Program Galicia 2014-2020; Xunta de Galicia, Grant/Award Number: ED431C 2016-037; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI), Grant/Award Number: CGL2016-75904-C2-1-P; Fondos Feder: ""Unha maneira de facer Europa",,,2,2,3,7,,,,1755-098X,1755-0998,,MOL ECOL RESOUR,Mol.

A lack of understanding of the effects of elevated temperature on shark behaviour remains an impediment to forecasting ecosystem-wide impacts. Port Jackson shark eggs were incubated and reared at current and projected end-of-century temperatures (+3 degrees C). We tested juvenile's learning ability with a quantity discrimination task. The mortality rate of sharks reared in warm water was 41.7% compared with no mortality in the present-day sharks. Contrary to expectations, our results suggest that surviving hatchlings from the elevated-temperature group took fewer days to reach learning criterion and had a higher proportion of correct choice compared with hatchlings reared under present conditions. Additionally, this is the first data suggesting that sharks can discriminate different quantities. Our results seem to indicate that learning and behaviour might play a role in allowing elasmobranchs to overcome some of the deleterious effects of climate warming, but further research is needed to fully comprehend these findings.Significance statementThe world's oceans are warming at an unprecedented rate, which will impair development and alter physiological and behavioural traits in marine predators. Learning may play a leading role in allowing apex and mesopredators to adapt to a rapidly changing environment; however, no studies have tested the impacts of ocean warming in their learning abilities. We incubated and reared Port Jackson shark eggs at current and projected end-of-century temperatures (+3 degrees C). Contrary to expectations, surviving juveniles from the elevated-temperature group showed better learning performance, potentially adding learning ability to a growing list of traits that incubation temperature can modify during early development in marine predators. Our results were not entirely negative; it is possible that increased learning performance might allow apex and mesopredators to increase foraging efficiency and match increased energetic demands caused by elevated temperature.",,,,"; Brown, Culum/S-9826-2017","Gervais, Connor/0000-0001-6501-9798; Vila Pouca, Catarina/0000-0001-6956-5198; Brown, Culum/0000-0002-0210-1820; Reed, Joshua/0000-0001-5420-2079",Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; Endeavour Postgraduate (PhD) Scholarship,"This research was funded by the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University, and CVP was supported by an Endeavour Postgraduate (PhD) Scholarship.",,,3,3,8,13,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

On King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo, West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) several fjords undergo rapid glacial retreat in response to increasing atmospheric temperatures. Hence, extended meltwater plumes laden with suspended particulate matter (SPM) are generated that hamper primary production during the austral summer season. We used ensemble modeling to approximate changes in the benthic productivity of an Antarctic fjord as a function of SPM discharge. A set of environmental variables was statistically selected and an ensemble of correlative species-distribution models was devised to project scattered georeferenced observation data to a spatial distribution of macroalgae for a ""time of measurement"" (""tom"") scenario (2008-2015). The model achieved statistically reliable validation results (true scale statistics 0.833, relative operating characteristics 0.975) and explained more than 60% of the modeled macroalgae distribution with the variables ""hard substrate"" and ""SPM."" This ""tom"" scenario depicts a macroalgae cover of similar to 8% (63 ha) for the total study area (8 km(2)) and a summer production of similar to 350 t dry weight. Assuming a linear increase of meltwater SPM load over time, two past (1991 and 1998), and two future (2019 and 2026) simulations with varying SPM intensities were applied. The simulation using only 50% of the ""tom"" scenario SPM amount (simulating 1991) resulted in increased macroalgal distribution (143 ha) and a higher summer production (792 t) compared to the ""tom"" status and could be validated using historical data. Forecasting the year 2019 from the ""tom"" status, an increase of 25% SPM results in a predicted reduction of macroalgae summer production to similar to 60% (141 t). We present a first quantitative model for changing fjordic macroalgal production under continued melt conditions at WAP. As meltwater influenced habitats are extending under climate change conditions, our approach can serve to approximate future productivity shifts for WAP fjord systems. The reduction of macroalgal productivity as predicted for Potter Cove may have significant consequences for polar coastal ecosystems under continuing climate change.",,,,,"Pehlke, Hendrik/0000-0003-1916-7831","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [JE 680/1-1, ZA 753/1-1, SPP 1158]; Marie Curie Action IRSES, within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 IRSES)European Union (EU) [318718]","The research was supported by Grants JE 680/1-1 and ZA 753/1-1 of the priority programme SPP 1158 Antarctic Research with Comparative Investigations in Arctic Ice Areas of the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Wetlands compose only 1-3% of these landscapes; however, large populations of migratory waterbirds rely on these wetlands to support energetically demanding life history events such as breeding and migration. Migration is considered a crucial period for birds associated with individual survival and reproductive success, yet our understanding of migration ecology remains limited. To better inform conservation planning supportive of these demands, we quantified synchrony of wetland flooding and waterbird migration by reconstructing bi-monthly surface water patterns from 1984 to 2015 across 11.4 million ha of the semi-arid Great Basin, USA. Results were then linked to seasonal migration chronologies for seven dabbling ducks species. Seasonal patterns were used in landscape planning simulations to assess efficiency in conservation strategies that aligned temporally sensitive wetland flooding and species migration. Wetland data were combined with land tenure to evaluate periodicity in waterfowl reliance on public and private lands. We found migration chronologies misaligned with wetland flooding. In spring, half (4359%) to three-quarters (68-74%) of seasonal wetlands were flooded and available to early-and latemigrating species while seasonal drying restricted wetland flooding to 13-20% of sites during fall migration. Simulations showed wetland conservation inconsiderate of temporal availability was only 67-75% efficient in meeting waterfowl habitat goals on private lands that made up similar to 70% of flooded wetland area in spring. Private-public wetland flooding was equivalent during fall migration. Accounting for spatiotemporal patterns of wetland flooding is imperative to improving efficiencies linked to migratory bird conservation. Timing of public-private wetland flooding, demonstrated by our models, provides landscape context that emphasized a joint role in supporting migratory waterbird habitat. Integrated management scenarios may capitalize on public lands' flexibility to expand fall flooding to offset seasonal drying on private lands while targeted incentive-based conservation assures private wetland flooding in spring. Such scenarios illustrate benefits of holistic public-private wetlands management representing a forward-looking alternative that aligns conservation with forecasts of increasing water scarcity.",,,,,"Donnelly, Patrick/0000-0002-9910-0794",National Resources Conservation Service in Oregon; Intermountain West Joint Venture,"We thank the National Resources Conservation Service in Oregon for their funding, leadership, and vision that made development of this project possible.

Measures of genetic diversity are often based on selectively neutral markers, such as microsatellites. Genetic diversity to guide conservation management, however, is better reflected by adaptive markers, including genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our aim was to assess MHC and neutral genetic diversity in two contrasting bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) populations in Western Australia-one apparently viable population with high reproductive output (Shark Bay) and one with lower reproductive output that was forecast to decline (Bunbury). We assessed genetic variation in the two populations by sequencing the MHC class II DQB, which encompasses the functionally important peptide binding regions (PBR). Neutral genetic diversity was assessed by genotyping twenty-three microsatellite loci. We confirmed that MHC is an adaptive marker in both populations. Overall, the Shark Bay population exhibited greater MHC diversity than the Bunbury population-for example, it displayed greater MHC nucleotide diversity. In contrast, the difference in microsatellite diversity between the two populations was comparatively low. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that viable populations typically display greater genetic diversity than less viable populations. The results also suggest that MHC variation is more closely associated with population viability than neutral genetic variation. Although the inferences from our findings are limited, because we only compared two populations, our results add to a growing number of studies that highlight the usefulness of MHC as a potentially suitable genetic marker for animal conservation. The Shark Bay population, which carries greater adaptive genetic diversity than the Bunbury population, is thus likely more robust to natural or human-induced changes to the coastal ecosystem it inhabits.",,,,"Manlik, Oliver/W-3283-2018; Frere, Celine/B-4905-2013","Manlik, Oliver/0000-0002-0924-3768; Frere, Celine/0000-0002-9671-2138; Mann, Janet/0000-0003-0664-175X; Krutzen, Michael/0000-0003-1055-5299","WV Scott Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0918308, 0941487, 1559380]; Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation [RM09107]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; PADI Foundation; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Shark Bay Shire; United Arab Emirates University","WV Scott Foundation; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 0918308, 0941487 and 1559380; Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation, Grant/Award Number: RM09107; NSERC; National Geographic Society; PADI Foundation; Australian Research Council; Shark Bay Shire; United Arab Emirates University",,,2,2,2,6,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Hundreds of studies have collected demographic data and used matrix and/or integral projection models to quantify lifetime fitness and population dynamics of plants. However, most of these studies have focused on native plant species, and there is a need for more studies on alien plants. Further, few studies on alien plants have experimentally manipulated environmental drivers in order to understand the mechanisms that allow alien plant species to have positive population growth. A synthetic understanding of the population dynamics of alien plant species will only be achieved if ecologists collect demographic data on many plant species and environments and provide the demographic data and model structure in a data archive for future comparisons and meta-analyses. Invasive alien species are a social, economic, and ecological issue that has become increasingly important in an increasingly globalized world. Researchers continue to forecast impacts and prevent new introductions by seeking a robust understanding of drivers of invasive species success and failure. Researchers have hypothesized that competitive differences may play a key role in determining alien species success in novel environments. Studies that experimentally manipulate competitors while quantifying demography provide mechanistic insight into species' responses to competition. To date, nearly all field manipulations of competition that measure plant demography and population dynamics have focused on native plant species. The data we provide here aim to address this gap in our knowledge for alien plant species. We present raw data and population-projection models for 14 alien plant species in eastern Missouri, USA. We sampled under ambient conditions and with all individuals of nonfocal species removed from the community, allowing us to project population dynamics in the presence and absence of competition.

There is concern that climate change will exacerbate the impacts of disturbance and thereby promote biotic homogenization, but its consequences for ecological services are unknown. We investigated the individual and interactive effects of increasing chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and aridity on seed dispersal services provided by ants in Caatinga vegetation of north-eastern Brazil. The study was conducted in Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil. Within an area of 214 km(2), we established nineteen 50 x 20 m plots that encompassed gradients of both CAD and aridity. We offered diaspores of six plant species, three myrmecochorous diaspores and three fleshy fruits that are secondarily dispersed by ants. We then quantified the number of interactions, seed removal rate and dispersal distances, and noted the identities of interacting ant species. Finally, we used pitfall trap data to quantify the abundances of ant disperser species in each plot. Our results show that overall composition of ant disperser species varied along the gradients of CAD and aridity, but the composition of high-quality dispersers varied only with aridity. The total number of interactions, rates of removal and mean distance of removal all declined with increasing aridity, but they were not related to CAD. These same patterns were found when considering only high-quality disperser species, driven by the responses of the dominant disperser Dinoponera quadriceps. We found little evidence of interactive effects of CAD and aridity on seed dispersal services by ants. Our study indicates that CAD and aridity act independently on ant-mediated seed dispersal services in Caatinga, such that the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance are unlikely to change under the forecast climate of increased aridity. However, our findings highlight the vulnerability of seed dispersal services provided by ants in Caatinga under an increasingly arid climate due to low functional redundancy in high-quality disperser species. Given the large number of plant species dependent on ants for seed dispersal, this has important implications for future plant recruitment and, consequently, for the composition of Caatinga plant communities.",,,,"Ribeiro-Neto, Jose Domingos/F-6080-2012; Andersen, Alan N/F-8763-2010; Arnan, Xavier/N-7829-2013; Leal, Inara/E-8362-2010","Ribeiro-Neto, Jose Domingos/0000-0003-0505-7287; Andersen, Alan N/0000-0003-1487-3323; Arnan, Xavier/0000-0002-9904-274X; Leal, Inara/0000-0002-8125-2191; Burle Arcoverde, Gabriela/0000-0003-0617-1487; Oliveira, Fernanda/0000-0002-7253-9078","Rufford Foundation [RSG 17372-1]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCAPES [PVE 88881.030482/2013-01]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [Edital Universal 470480/2013-0, PELD 403770/2012-2]; Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco [APQ-0138-2.05/14, APQ-0738-2.05/12]","Rufford Foundation, Grant/Award Number: RSG 17372-1; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: PVE 88881.030482/2013-01; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: Edital Universal 470480/2013-0 and PELD 403770/2012-2; Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco, Grant/Award Number: APQ-0138-2.05/14, APQ-0138-2.05/14 and APQ-0738-2.05/12",,,4,4,4,14,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Therefore, identifying traits that predict organism performance, ecosystem function and response to changes in environmental conditions can help forecast how ecosystems are responding to the Anthropocene. Morphology dictates how organisms interact with their environment and other organisms, partially determining the environmental and biological contexts in which they are successful. Morphology is important for autogenic ecosystem engineering organisms, such as reef-building corals, because it determines the shape of the structures they create and by extension the communities they support. Here, we present six morphological traits that capture variation in volume compactness, surface complexity and top-heaviness. With support from the literature, we propose causal links between morphology and a performance-function-response framework. To illustrate these concepts, we combine 3D scanning and coral survey data to predict morphological traits from in situ colonies. We present a case study that examines how assemblage-scale morphological traits have responded to two cyclones and the 2016 mass bleaching event-two phenomena predicted to increase in severity in the Anthropocene-and discuss how these changes may impact ecosystem function. The morphological traits outlined here offer a generalised and hypothesis-driven approach to tracking how reefs respond to the Anthropocene.

We synthesise current understanding of the structure and function of tropical macroalgal reefs and how they may support various ecosystem goods and services. We then forecast how key stressors may alter the role of macroalgal reefs in tropical seascapes of the Anthropocene. High levels of primary productivity from tropical canopy macroalgae, which rivals that of other key producers (e.g., corals and turf algae), can be widely dispersed across tropical seascapes to provide a boost of secondary productivity in a range of biomes that include coral reefs, and support periodic harvests of macroalgal biomass for industrial and agricultural uses. Complex macroalgal reefs that comprise a mixture of canopy and understorey taxa can also provide key habitats for a diverse community of epifauna, as well as juvenile and adult fishes that are the basis for important tropical fisheries. Key macroalgal taxa (e.g., Sargassum) that form complex macroalgal reefs are likely to be sensitive to future climate change. Increases in maximum sea temperature, in particular, could depress biomass production and/or drive phenological shifts in canopy formation that will affect their capacity to support tropical marine ecosystems. Macroalgal reefs can support a suite of tropical marine ecosystem functions when embedded within an interconnected mosaic of habitat types. Habitat connectivity is, therefore, essential if we are to maintain tropical marine biodiversity alongside key ecosystem goods and services. Consequently, complex macroalgal reefs should be treated as a key ecological asset in strategies for the conservation and management of diverse tropical seascapes.

However, habitat loss and fragmentation, coupled with the rapidity of climate change, make it difficult for species to keep pace. It is therefore unsurprising that enhancing landscape connectivity is the most frequently cited climate-adaptation strategy for conserving biodiversity. Yet most connectivity planning, even if intended to address climate change, does not directly take climate change and climate-driven range shifts into account. Nonetheless, several approaches that do explicitly address the unique challenges posed by climate change have recently emerged. We review these connectivity modeling approaches: specifically, how they incorporate species' responses, identify movement routes, and address uncertainties. Despite this proliferation of approaches, conceptual and analytical hurdles remain, and meeting these challenges will be critical to achieving effective landscape connectivity for species in the face of climate change.",,,,,,Wilburforce Foundation [UWAS1811],We thank the Wilburforce Foundation (grant number UWAS1811) for supporting this work.,,,4,4,14,36,,,,1540-9295,1540-9309,,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

Yet, predicting vegetation dynamics often suffers from an inherent scale mismatch, with abundant data and process understanding being available at a fine spatial grain, but the relevance for decision-making is increasing with spatial extent. We present a novel approach for scaling vegetation dynamics (SVD), using deep learning to predict vegetation transitions. Vegetation is discretized into a large number (10(3)-10(6)) of potential states based on its structure, composition and functioning. Transition probabilities between states are estimated via a deep neural network (DNN) trained on observed or simulated vegetation transitions in combination with environmental variables. The impact of vegetation transitions on important ecological indicators is quantified by probabilistically linking attributes such as carbon storage and biodiversity to vegetation states. Here, we describe the SVD approach and present results of applying the framework in a meta-modelling context. We trained a DNN using simulations of a process-based forest landscape model for a complex mountain forest landscape under different climate scenarios. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of SVD to project long-term vegetation dynamics and the resulting changes in forest carbon storage and biodiversity. SVD captured spatial (e.g. elevational gradients) and temporal (e.g. species succession) patterns of vegetation dynamics well, and responded realistically to changing environmental conditions. In addition, we tested the computational efficiency of the approach, highlighting the utility of SVD for country- to continental scale applications. SVD is the-to our knowledge-first vegetation model harnessing deep neural networks. The approach has high predictive accuracy and is able to generalize well beyond training data. SVD was designed to run on widely available input data (e.g. vegetation states defined from remote sensing, gridded global climate datasets) and exceeds the computational performance of currently available highly optimized landscape models by three to four orders of magnitude. We conclude that SVD is a promising approach for combining detailed process knowledge on fine-grained ecosystem processes with the increasingly available big ecological datasets for improved large-scale projections of vegetation dynamics.",,,,,"Seidl, Rupert/0000-0002-3338-3402",Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [START Y895-B25],"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: START Y895-B25",,,2,2,3,9,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Vegetation change was related to values for precipitation and temperature derived from the Global Land Data Assimilation System for the period 1948-2017 as well as the number of fog days expected at a site. The resulting analysis reveals a trend of increased vegetation cover associated with increased precipitation (fog and rain) in the coastal Fogbelt and the inland Savanna transition with a shrinking of the hyper-arid Minimum zone between the two. These findings accord with projected effects of global warming on the Benguela upwelling system but are at variance with regional climate model forecasts that project widespread aridification.

For species that are slow growing and poorly dispersed, climate change can force a lag between the distributions of species and the geographic distributions of their climatic envelopes, exposing species to the risk of extinction. Climate also governs the resilience of species and ecosystems to disturbance, such as wildfire. Here we use species distribution modelling and palaeoecology to assess and test the impact of vegetation-climate disequilibrium on the resilience of an endangered fire-sensitive rainforest community to fires. First, we modelled the probability of occurrence of Athrotaxis spp. and Nothofagus gunnii rainforest in Tasmania (hereon ""montane rainforest"") as a function of climate. We then analysed three pollen and charcoal records spanning the last 7,500 cal year BP from within both high (n = 1) and low (n = 2) probability of occurrence areas. Our study indicates that climatic change between 3,000 and 4,000 cal year bp induced a disequilibrium between montane rainforests and climate that drove a loss of resilience of these communities. Current and future climate change are likely to shift the geographic distribution of the climatic envelopes of this plant community further, suggesting that current high-resilience locations will face a reduction in resilience. Coupled with the forecast of increasing fire activity in southern temperate regions, this heralds a significant threat to this and other slow growing, poorly dispersed and fire sensitive forest systems that are common in the southern mid to high latitudes.",,,,"MARIANI, MICHELA/P-9787-2019","MARIANI, MICHELA/0000-0003-1996-3694; Fletcher, Michael-Shawn/0000-0002-1854-5629","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DI110100019, IN140100050]","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DI110100019 and IN140100050",,,3,3,7,31,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In the 21st century, many species will move into higher latitudes and higher elevations as the climate warms. In addition, the relative abundances of species within local assemblages are likely to change. Both effects have implications for how ecosystems function. Few biodiversity forecasts, however, take account of both shifting ranges and changing abundances. We provide a novel analysis predicting the potential changes to assemblage-level relative abundances in the 21st century. We use an established relationship linking ant abundance and their colour and size traits to temperature and UV-B to predict future abundance changes. We also predict future temperature driven range shifts and use these to alter the available species pool for our trait-mediated abundance predictions. We do this across three continents under a low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Under RCP2.6, predicted changes to ant assemblages by 2100 are moderate. On average, species richness will increase by 26%, while species composition and relative abundance structure will be 26% and 30% different, respectively, compared with modern assemblages. Under RCP8.5, however, highland assemblages face almost a tripling of species richness and compositional and relative abundance changes of 66% and 77%. Critically, we predict that future assemblages could be reorganized in terms of which species are common and which are rare: future highland assemblages will not simply comprise upslope shifts of modern lowland assemblages. These forecasts reveal the potential for radical change to montane ant assemblages by the end of the 21st century if temperature increases continue. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating trait-environment relationships into future biodiversity predictions.

Ecological studies of urban wetlands have typically focused on large metropolitan areas, but non-traditional urbanizing areas such as the towns of the Great Plains of North America are projected to experience land-use and climate changes that will alter connectivity among the freshwater wetlands along a continental-scale migratory wildlife corridor. We used seven graph theory metrics to quantify connectivity among 89,798 of these wetlands under landscape-change forecasts from two models built for three climate change and development scenarios, projected to the year 2050. We compared outcomes from models that differed in focal variable (impervious surface or developed land use). Overall, models with impervious surface projections resulted in the most wetlands affected, whereas models featuring developed land use projections resulted in the largest spatial distribution of effect. There were differences in how many and which wetlands were forecast to become urbanized by model and scenario, resulting in different wetland network topologies and differences in the connectivity roles of individual wetlands. A consensus network was therefore developed based on the wetlands that were projected to increase in impervious surface and exist within developed land use by 2050. These 126 wetlands can be prioritized for urban ecological studies or management because they are highly likely to be affected regardless of model or scenario.

In Europe, it is considered a species of Union concern and national authorities have to establish surveillance plans, early warning and rapid response systems or control plans. These strategies customarily require the assessment of the areas that could be colonised beyond outbreaks or expanding ranges, so as to establish efficient containment protocols. The hornet is spreading through a mix of natural diffusion and human-mediated transportation. Despite the latter dispersion mode is hardly predictable, natural diffusion could be modelled from nest data of consecutive years. The aim of this work is to develop a procedure to predict the spread of the yellow-legged hornet in the short term in order to increase the efficiency of control plans to restrain the diffusion of this species. We used data on the mean distances of colonial nests between years to evaluate the probability of yellow-legged hornet dispersal around the areas where the species is present. The distribution of nests in Italy was mainly explained by elevation (95% of nests located within 521 m a.s.l.) and distance from source sites (previous years' colonies; 95% within 1.4-6.2 km). The diffusion models developed with these two variables forecast, with good accuracy, the spread of the species in the short term: 98-100% of nests were found within the predicted area of expansion. A similar approach can be applied in areas invaded by the yellow-legged hornet, in particular beyond new outbreaks and over the border of its expanding range, to implement strategies for its containment. The spatial application of the models allows the establishment of buffer areas where monitoring and control efforts can be allocated on the basis of the likelihood of the species spreading at progressively greater distances.",,,,"Bertolino, Sandro/V-5508-2019","LIOY, Simone/0000-0003-2939-988X",EUEuropean Union (EU) [LIFE14 NAT/IT/001128 STOPVESPA],"We would like to express special thanks to Luca Croce who collaborated in the activities, to the many volunteers and beekeepers who reported nest locations in these years.

They also contribute to global economies by directly and indirectly supporting commercial and recreational fisheries. Managing forage fish is problematic due to their high spatial-temporal variation in biomass and strong responses to environmental variability. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain variation in capelin Mallotus villosus biomass, a keystone forage fish in the Northwest Atlantic, including factors influencing cohort strength such as larval abundance and larval food (i.e. Pseudocalanus spp.) availability. Alternately, pre-spawning mortality of capelin may be regulated by the timing of the retreat of sea ice (t(i)(ce)) via its effects on the spring bloom and the availability of food (e.g. Calanus spp.) for adult capelin, or by the condition of adult capelin the previous fall. Here, we used a Bayesian approach in a multimodel inference framework to assess support for a series of hypotheses explaining the population dynamics of capelin. The most parsimonious model included larval abundance, t(i)(ce), and capelin condition in the fall, and explained 68% of the variance in capelin biomass. These results are consistent with much of the literature that suggests capelin in the Northwest Atlantic are driven by bottom-up forces. This model allows us to produce forecasts of capelin biomass 1-2 management cycles in advance, which will be a valuable contribution to the management of this forage fish species.",,,,,,Department of Fisheries and Oceans through the Strategic Program for Ecosystem-Based Research and Advice; Marine Mammals section,"This work was supported by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, specifically through the Strategic Program for Ecosystem-Based Research and Advice (Principal investigators: A.D.B. and P.M.R.).

These factors erode biodiversity and change biological communities and ecosystem processes that are ultimately responsible for the ecosystem services that nature provides to humans. To forecast and mitigate these effects is the environmental challenge of our age. Scientific research has advanced our knowledge of the impacts of global change on ecosystems. Comparatively, however, it remains unclear how ecosystem recover after perturbations, and we lack a general theory of the ecosystem recovery dynamics. In this article, I argue that the ecological interactions between species and the networks they form are essential components to understand the restoration and functioning of recovering ecosystems. Interaction networks allow us to understand the appropriate spatial and temporal scales for an efficient restoration of multifunctional ecosystems. Ecological restoration must also aim to recover stable ecosystems in a scenario where climate change and the fragmentation of natural habitats will be pervasive.

Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems' intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE-FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.",,,,"Rosenbaum, Benjamin/K-6723-2019; Matthews, Blake/B-5608-2009; Tabi, Andrea/M-7027-2019; Kratina, Pavel/O-5192-2019; Palamara, Gian M./AAH-5274-2020; Williams, Richard J/B-8344-2011","Rosenbaum, Benjamin/0000-0002-2815-0874; Matthews, Blake/0000-0001-9089-704X; Tabi, Andrea/0000-0002-5028-1117; Kratina, Pavel/0000-0002-9144-7937; Williams, Richard J/0000-0001-8847-3213; Pennekamp, Frank/0000-0003-0679-1045; Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253; Ye, Hao/0000-0002-8630-1458",Synthesis Centre of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research [DFG-FZT-118]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_159498]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Omidyar Fellowship from the Santa Fe Institute; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative [GBMF4563]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FZT 118],"This paper originates from the ""sPRED-Synthesizing Predictability Research of Ecological Dynamics"" working group, supported by the Synthesis Centre of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (DFG-FZT-118).

Prediction and quantification of wave attenuation characteristics due to localized processes is an essential pre-requisite for coastal zone management activities. Due to lack of observations as well the difficulty involved in the procurement of direct observations over this region, detailed numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the wave attenuation characteristics and thereby assess the reliability of a spectral wave model SWAN for the area of interest. The study utilized a coupled wave-hydrodynamic model ADCIRC+SWAN to establish and quantify the wave damping effects attributed by bottom mud during an extreme weather event, a case study for SIDR cyclone. Waves propagating over a shallow water environment having muddy bottom decays exponentially with the depth/distance and dissipates completely near to the shoreline. Maximum attenuation rates of 84%, 70% and 33% was estimated during the three different weather events categorized as fair, rough, and extreme respectively. The study signifies that wave dissipation rates are found to be relatively less during extreme weather conditions over a muddy bottom environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, nonlinearity and stochasticity introduce significant challenges to the analysis of ecological time series, such as the inference of the effect of species interactions on community dynamics and forecasting of species abundances. Local linear fits with state-space-dependent kernel functions, known as S-maps, provide an efficient method to infer Jacobian coefficients (a proxy for the local effect of species interactions) and to make reliable forecasts from nonlinear time series. Yet, while it has been shown that the S-map outperforms existing methods for nonparametric inference and forecasting, the methodology is sensitive to process noise. To overcome this limitation, we integrate the S-map with different regularization schemes. To validate our approach, we test our methodology against different levels of noise and nonlinearity using three standard population dynamics models. We show that an appropriate choice of the regularization scheme, alongside an accurate choice of the kernel functions, can significantly improve the in-sample inference of Jacobian coefficients and the out-of-sample forecast of species abundances in the presence of process noise. We further validate our methodology using two empirical time series of marine microbial communities. Our results illustrate that the regularized S-map is an efficient method for nonparametric inference and forecasting from noisy, nonlinear, ecological time series.

They have been increasingly used in fields such as ecology, biogeography and evolution, and often support conservation priorities and strategies. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand how trustworthy and reliable their predictions are. Different approaches, such as using ensemble methods (combining forecasts of different single models), or applying the most suitable threshold to transform continuous probability maps into species presences or absences, have been used to reduce model-based uncertainty. Taking into account the influence of biased sampling imprecision in species location, small datasets and species ecological characteristics, may also help to detect and compensate for uncertainty in the model building process. To investigate the effect of applying an ensemble approach, several threshold selection criteria and different datasets representing seasonal and spatial sampling bias, on models' accuracy, SDMs were built for four estuarine fish species with distinct use of the estuarine systems. Overall, predictions obtained with the ensemble approach were more accurate. Variability in accuracy metrics obtained with the nine threshold selection criteria applied was more pronounced for species with low prevalence and when sensitivity was calculated. Higher values of accuracy measures were registered with the threshold that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity, and the threshold where the predicted prevalence equals the observed, whereas the 0.5 cut-off was unreliable, originating the lowest values for these metrics. Accuracy of models created from a spatially biased sampling was overall higher than accuracy of models created with a seasonally biased sampling or with the multi-year database created and this pattern was consistently obtained for marine migrant species, which use estuaries as nursery areas, presenting a seasonally and regular use of these ecosystems. The ecological dependence between these fish species and estuaries may add difficulties in the model building process, and needs to be taken into account, to improve their accuracy. The present study highlights the need for a thorough analysis of the critical underlying issues of the complete model building process to predict the distribution of estuarine fish species, due to the particular and dynamic nature of these ecosystems.",,,,"Cabral, Henrique/D-5201-2011; Franca, Susana Oliveira/B-2847-2012","Cabral, Henrique/0000-0002-7646-6208; Franca, Susana Oliveira/0000-0002-3406-6951","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAR/04292/2019, PTDC/MAR-EST/3048/2014]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BPD/80043/2011]",This work had the support of the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) via UID/MAR/04292/2019 and project grant PTDC/MAR-EST/3048/2014.

Insufficient monitoring can induce a tautology as lack of monitoring resources makes it difficult to determine whether a species or population deserves additional monitoring resources. When in-situ monitoring resources are limited, remote habitat monitoring could be a useful supplementary tool, as linking parameterized species distribution models to spatially explicit time-series of environmental correlates allows iterative prediction of population change. Yet the performance of predictive forecasts or hindcasts has been difficult to evaluate. We paired contemporary field data, historic population estimates, and a remotely-sensed archive of landscape change to evaluate predictions of American marten (Martes americana) population decline owing to habitat loss in Maine, USA. We estimated contemporary spatial patterns in marten density relative to landscape disturbance with spatial capture-recapture models. We compared current density estimates to historical density calculations to evaluate population decline, and compared historical calculations to habitat-based model predictions to evaluate the efficacy of habitat monitoring as a proxy for direct monitoring. Marten density was negatively associated with the proportion of surrounding regenerating forest, and point estimates within focal townships were 50-80% lower than historical calculations. Habitat-based hindcasts of marten density across our entire focal area interest suggested a smaller population decline (roughly 50%) within our focal area. Thus, although habitat-based predictions underpredicted marten decline, they provided correct directional inference. Habitat monitoring and predictions from species distribution models may provide useful inference about population changes given trends in habitat at limited expense when in-situ information is lacking.",,,,,,"Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act [3013311]; University of Maine; MDIFW; U.S. Geological Survey, Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research UnitUnited States Geological Survey; NASA Ecological Forecasting [NNX14AC36G]; NESSF [NNX16AO61H]","Funding was provided by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (award #3013311).

We empirically tested two important hypotheses regarding tree responses to drought and insect defoliation: (a) trees exhibit delayed, persistent, and cumulative growth responses to these stressors; (b) physiological feedbacks in tree responses to these stressors exacerbate their impacts on tree growth. These hypotheses remain largely untested at a landscape scale, yet are critical for predicting forest function under novel future conditions, given the connection between tree growth and demographic processes such as mortality and regeneration. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the ecological memory of tree growth to past water deficits and insect defoliation events, derive antecedent variables reflecting the persistent and cumulative effects of these stressors on current growth, and test for their interactive effects. The model was applied to extensive tree growth, weather, and defoliation survey data from western and eastern regions of the Canadian boreal forest impacted by recent drought and defoliation events and characterized by contrasting tree compositions, climates, and insect defoliators. Results revealed persistent negative tree growth responses to past water (all trees) and defoliation (host trees) stress lasting 3-6 and 10-12 years, respectively, depending on study region. Accounting for the ecological memory of tree growth to water and defoliation stress allowed for detection of interactions not previously demonstrated. Contrary to expectations, we found evidence for positive interactions among non-host trees likely due to reduced water stress following defoliation events. Regional differences in ecological memory to water stress highlight the role of climate in shaping forest responses to drought. Synthesis. Study results suggest negative feedbacks in tree responses to drought and insect attack may be weaker than predicted for defoliator-dominated boreal forest systems. Instead, insect defoliation may offset the impacts of water deficit on boreal tree growth by reducing transpirational water demand. This offset mimics increased resistance to drought following forest thinning and may lessen growth and mortality losses due to increased aridity and more severe insect damage forecast for the boreal forest under global change.",,,,,"D'Orangeville, Loic/0000-0001-7841-7082; Itter, Malcolm/0000-0002-0184-2731","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1513481, EF-1137309, EF-1241874, EF-1253225]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DMS-1513481, EF-1137309, EF-1241874 and EF-1253225",,,4,4,10,43,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The aerosphere, however, is also utilized by aviation which leads to increasing conflicts in and around airfields as well as en-route. Collisions between birds and aircraft cost billions of euros annually and, in some cases, result in the loss of human lives. Simultaneously, aviation has diverse negative impacts on wildlife. During avian migration, due to the sheer numbers of birds in the air, the risk of bird strikes becomes particularly acute for low-flying aircraft, especially during military training flights. Over the last few decades, air forces across Europe and the Middle East have been developing solutions that integrate ecological research and aviation policy to reduce mutual negative interactions between birds and aircraft. In this paper we 1) provide a brief overview of the systems currently used in military aviation to monitor bird migration movements in the aerosphere, 2) provide a brief overview of the impact of bird strikes on military low-level operations, and 3) estimate the effectiveness of migration monitoring systems in bird strike avoidance. We compare systems from the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland and Israel, which are all areas that Palearctic migrants cross twice a year in huge numbers. We show that the en-route bird strikes have decreased considerably in countries where avoidance systems have been implemented, and that consequently bird strikes are on average 45% less frequent in countries with implemented avoidance systems in place.

We investigated drivers of outbreaks by larch casebearer Coleophora laricella, an invasive defoliator, and eastern larch beetle Dendroctonus simplex, a native, tree-killing bark beetle, on tamarack Larix laricina from 2000 to in Minnesota, USA. We evaluated the utility of temporal, spatial and climatic variables in predicting the presence/absence of outbreaks of each insect in cells of rasterized aerial survey data. The role of defoliation by larch casebearer in outbreaks of eastern larch beetle was also investigated. For both species, the most important predictors of outbreak occurrence were proximity of conspecific outbreaks in space and time. For larch casebearer, outbreak occurrence was positively associated with spring precipitation and warmer growing seasons. Outbreak occurrence of eastern larch beetle was positively associated with warmer and dryer years and was more likely in cells with prior defoliation by larch casebearer.

Focusing on interactions between larval amphibians and trematode parasites, we experimentally contrasted the effects of host richness and species composition to identify the individual and joint contributions of both parameters on the infection levels of three trematode species. By combining experimental approaches with field surveys from 147 ponds, we further evaluated how richness effects differed between randomized and realistic patterns of species loss (i.e. community disassembly). Our results indicated that community-level changes in infection levels were owing to host species composition, rather than richness. However, when composition patterns mirrored empirical observations along a natural assembly gradient, each added host species reduced infection success by 12-55%. No such effects occurred when assemblages were randomized.

Temperature and day length are known environmental drivers of the reproductive timing of many species. Hence, reproductive phenology is sensitive to warming and is important to be considered for reliable predictions of species distributions. This is particularly relevant for rapidly spreading non-indigenous species (NIS). In this study, we forecast the future ranges of a NIS, the seaweed Sargassum muticum, including its reproductive phenology. Location Coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere (Pacific and Atlantic oceans). Methods We used ecological niche modelling to predict the distribution of S. muticum under two scenarios forecasting limited (RCP 2.6) and severe (RCP 8.5) future climate changes. We then refined our predictions with a hybrid model using sea surface temperature constraints on reproductive phenology. Results Under the most severe climate change scenario, we predicted northward expansions which may have significant ecological consequences for subarctic coastal ecosystems. However, in lower latitudes, habitats currently occupied by S. muticum will no longer be suitable, creating opportunities for substantial community changes. The temperature constraints imposed by the reproductive window were shown to restrict the modelled future species expansion strongly. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the total range area was expected to increase by 61.75% by 2100, but only by 1.63% when the reproductive temperature window was considered.

Species distribution models may result in misrepresented projections for species living in extreme conditions if based on truncated response functions. Model extrapolation may not detect declines that could occur if future environment conditions exceeded the physiological tolerance of the species. We developed a novel method aimed to overcome this constrain by incorporating the physiological response function of a tropical hydrocoral to temperature as a predictor variable in a Hybrid SDM. Location Atlantic Ocean. Methods We conducted ecophysiological experiments simulating heat and cold stress to determine the maximum photochemical efficiency of the hydrocoral's symbiont along a thermal gradient to identify sublethal and lethal conditions. The response curve obtained was then applied to a temperature raster to create a new physio-climatic variable, which was integrated into the Hybrid SDM as a predictor. Simple Physiological and Correlative SDMs were compared with the Hybrid model. Results The Hybrid SDM outperformed the Correlative SDM allowing predictions without extrapolations in the physio-climatic predictor. It suggested habitat contractions in tropical regions with forecasted temperatures above the coral's physiological tolerance, which were underrepresented by the Correlative SDM. It also incorporated habitat suitability restrictions by other predictors of unknown physiological response by incorporating correlative information (as limitations in river mouths by low salinity). In this way, by integrating mechanistic and correlative knowledge, the Hybrid SDM also predicted a potential expansion to higher latitudes, which agreed with the recent evidence of its expansion into the subtropical Canary Islands. Main conclusion Integrating physiological knowledge into Hybrid SDMs by adding a physio-climatic predictor improves model transferability resulting in predictions of decline in future climates, which may be misrepresented by SDMs trained at present-day conditions, and therefore are advisable for early warning in conservation management.",,,,"Martinez, Brezo/AAE-9825-2019","Martinez, Brezo/0000-0002-7501-7726","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [AP2012-3702, CGL2014-60193-P]; REMEDINAL 3 [P2013-MAE2719]","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: AP2012-3702 and CGL2014-60193-P; REMEDINAL 3, Grant/Award Number: P2013-MAE2719",,,4,4,4,11,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

However, despite proliferation of ensemble models, we lack oversight of how and where they are used for modelling distributions, and how well they perform. Here, we present such an overview. Location Global. Methods Since BIOMOD is freely available and widely used by ensemble species distribution modellers, we focused on articles that apply BIOMOD, filtering the initial 852 papers identified in our structured literature search to a relevant final subset of 224 eligible peer-reviewed journal articles. Results BIOMOD-based ensembles are used across many taxa and locations, with terrestrial plants being the most represented group of species (n = 72) and Europe being the most represented continent (n = 106). These studies often focus on forecasting distributions in the future (n = 109), and commonly use presence-only species data (n = 139) and climatic environmental predictors (n = 219). An average of six models are used in ensembles, and approximately half of ensembles weight contributions of models by their cross-validation performance. However, discussion about choices made in the modelling process and unambiguous information on the performance of ensemble models versus individual models are limited. The use of independent data to validate model performance is particularly uncommon. Main conclusions We document the breadth of ensemble applications, but could not draw strong quantitative conclusions about the predictive performance of ensemble models, due to lack of unambiguous information reported. Understanding how and where ensembles are best used when modelling species distributions is important for enabling best choices for different applications. To enable this objective to be achieved, we provide recommendations for thorough reporting practices in a BIOMOD-based ensemble workflow.",,,,"Lahoz-Monfort, Jose Joaquin/O-3546-2017; Elith, Jane/F-2022-2015; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/F-7461-2015","Lahoz-Monfort, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-0845-7035; Elith, Jane/0000-0002-8706-0326; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/0000-0002-8387-5739","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE160100904, DP160101003]","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DE160100904 and DP160101003",,,8,8,7,14,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Yet their interaction is largely unresolved. Using a single-species population model along a one-dimensional environmental gradient, we show how local competition and dispersal jointly shape the eco-evolutionary dynamics and speed of invasion. From a focal introduction site, the generic pattern predicted by our model features a temporal transition from wave-like to pulsed invasion. Each regime is driven primarily by local adaptation, while the transition is caused by eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by dispersal. The interaction range and cost of dispersal arise as key factors of the duration and speed of each phase. Our results demonstrate that spatial eco-evolutionary feedbacks along environmental gradients can drive strong temporal variation in the rate and structure of population spread, and must be considered to better understand and forecast invasion rates and range dynamics.",,,,,"Andrade-Restrepo, Martin/0000-0002-0371-5541","CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia Colciencias; Chair ""Modelisation Mathematique et Biodiversite' of Veolia Environnement - E cole Polytechnique - Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle - Fondation X; French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-14-CE25-0013]; FACE Partner University Fund; CNRS Mission pour l'Interdisciplinarite; LabEx MemoLife; PSL University (IRIS OCAV); PSL University (PSL-University of Arizona Mobility Program); NSF Dimensions of BiodiversityNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1831493]","We thank four anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that greatly improved the manuscript, and Feng Gao for discussion and comments on an initial version of the manuscript.

Such die-offs are concerning given that drought and heatwave events are forecast to increase in severity and duration as climate change progresses. Quantifying consequences to carbon dynamics and storage from die-off events are critical for determining the current and future mitigation potential of forests. We took stand measurements five times over 2+ years from affected and unaffected plots across the Northern Jarrah Forest, southwestern Australia, following an acute drought/heatwave in 2011. We found a significant loss of live standing carbon (49.3 t ha(-1)), and subsequently a significant increase in the dead standing carbon pool by 6 months post-die-off. Of the persisting live trees, 38% experienced partial mortality contributing to the rapid regrowth and replenishment (82%-88%) of labile carbon pools (foliage, twigs, and branches) within 26 months. Such regrowth was not substantial in terms of net carbon changes within the timeframe of the study but does reflect the resprouting resilience of this forest type. Dead carbon generated by the die-off may persist for centuries given low fragmentation and decay rates resulting in low biogenic emission rates relative to other forest types. However, future fire may threaten persistence of both dead and live pools via combustion and mortality of live tissue and impaired regrowth capacity. Resprouting forests are commonly regarded as resilient systems, however, a changing climate could see vulnerable portions of forests become carbon sources rather than carbon sinks.",,,,"Fontaine, Joseph/O-2758-2019; Harper, Richard/J-2142-2016","Fontaine, Joseph/0000-0002-6515-7864; Harper, Richard/0000-0003-0268-2917; Matusick, George/0000-0003-3198-4113; Hardy, Giles/0000-0001-7419-5064",,,,,3,3,4,19,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Sugarcane aphid (Melcuiaphis sacchari) is an economic pest of sorghum in Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America and recently invaded North America, affecting over 90% of the continent's sorghum production. Long-distance, wind-aided dispersal together with the ability to overwinter in the southernmost sorghum-producing areas appear responsible for their geographic spread in North America. We developed a spatially-explicit, individual-based, stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of sugarcane aphids to forecast regional infestations of sorghum fields. We parameterized and calibrated the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenologies of the southern to central Great Plains of the USA where sorghum is cultivated. We validated the model by comparing simulated spatial-temporal patterns of aphid infestations to georeferenced field data on infestations collected as part of an extensive field project. We assessed potential usefulness of the model by analysing regional patterns of aphid infestations on sorghum simulated under climatic conditions recorded in the southern to central Great Plains in 2017. On a regional scale, the simulated northward advance of aphid infestations generally followed the seasonal development of sorghum, with the main invasion front moving northward from southern to central Texas, then northwest towards the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma (northernmost and westernmost regions, respectively, of these states), and then northward again into central and western Kansas. Within this general regional trend, the stochastic nature of simulated infestations resulted in wide variation within each region with regard to time lags between the appearance of sorghum and initial infestation, which led to wide variation in infestation levels. The geographical distribution of simulated aphid infestation probabilities approximately mirrored the proportion of land cover in sorghum production, with a prominent infestation ""hot spot"" covering west-central Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. Models capable of simulating both local population dynamics as well as long-range, multi-generational dispersal of wind-borne pests show promise as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs.",,,,,"Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan/0000-0002-7850-0406","USDA, ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [58-3091-6-035]; Texas A&M AgriLife Research","This research was supported by USDA, ARS Agreement No. 58-3091-6-035 with Texas A&M AgriLife Research.

Existing numerical studies to assess their effectiveness and cooling benefits usually assume an unrealistic 100% coverage across the entire metropolis. This study investigates the scale dependence of the absolute cooling benefits and efficiency (cooling per adapted roof area) of cool and green roofs in a typical summer when they are installed over 25% of building rooftops at local, city, or regional scales. Six major U.S. cities with active climate action plans in different geoclimatic zones are compared through high-resolution simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The results reveal that reductions in 2-m air temperature over the urban core increase non-linearly with the intervention area, and the benefits of both roof types scale similarly. This scale-dependence of urban core cooling is not universal, but is rather controlled by the shape of metropolitan areas and wind pattern. The siting of mitigation measures hence plays an important role especially under windy conditions, and some urban cores are not able to achieve a noticeable and consistent cooling by retrofitting their own rooftops. Regional-scale deployments of mitigation strategies, on the other hand, yield a more substantial temperature reduction but with a lower efficiency. The scale-dependence of regional cooling efficiency showed remarkable similarity across studied cities, yielding a potentially generalizable power law. The successful resiliency plans for cities should account for the scale dependence and geoclimatic determinants of the achievable cooling, and identify the target neighborhoods of most interest.",,,,"Bou-Zeid, Elie/AAC-5307-2019","yang, jiachuan/0000-0002-3890-5628","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1664091]; U.S. National Science Foundation through the UWIN Sustainability Research Network Cooperative Agreement [1444758]; National Center for Atmospheric Research [UPRI0007, UPRI0016]",This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant 1664091 and through the UWIN Sustainability Research Network Cooperative Agreement 1444758.

The timing of algal blooms correlates highly to a summer low-flow period when residence time is long and nutrients are available. Because of complex interactions between physical transport and algal dynamics, it is challenging to predict interannual variations of bloom correctly using a complex eutrophication model without having a high-resolution model grid to resolve complex geometry and an accurate estimate of nutrient loading to drive the model. In this study, an approach using long-term observational data (from 1990 to 2013) and the Support vector machine (LS-SVM) for simulating algal blooms was applied. The Empirical Orthogonal Function was used to reduce the data dimension that enables the algal bloom dynamics for the entire TT to be modeled by one model. The model results indicate that the data-driven model is capable of simulating interannual algal blooms with good predictive skills and is capable of forecasting algal blooms responding to the change of nutrient loadings and environmental conditions.

In lieu of the paradigm about disease incidences varying seasonally in line with meteorology, this work seeks to determine how well simple epidemic models can capture such seasonality for better forecasts and optimal futuristic interventions. Once incidence data are assimilated by a periodic model, asymptotic analysis in relation to the long-term behavior of the disease occurrences can be performed using the classical Floquet theory, which explains the stability of the existing periodic solutions. For an illustrative case, we employed infected-recovered models with an infection rate of a single period and that of commensurate periods to assimilate weekly dengue incidence data from the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, which we present in their raw and moving-average-filtered version. To estimate the infection rate of a single period, eight optimization schemes were assigned returning magnitudes of the rate that vary insignificantly across schemes. Three schemes were assigned to estimate the infection rate of commensurate periods based on three different sets of periods used. Each scheme involving commensurate periods gives better fitting than that involving only a single period. The computation results combined with the analytical results indicate that if the disease surveillance in the city does not improve, then the incidence will raise to a certain positive orbit and remain cyclical.",,,,,,"Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenristek DIKTI) [370/UN2.R3.1/HKP05.00/2018]","This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenristek DIKTI), with PUPT research grant scheme 2018 No. 370/UN2.R3.1/HKP05.00/2018.

These changes alter the period of maximum and potential total carbon uptake, especially in highly seasonal environments such as the Arctic. Earlier plant growth has been observed, and if plant senescence remains the same or is delayed, growing season extension will likely lead to greater carbon uptake and growth. We used phenology data from a multifactor climate change experiment to examine how altered seasonality influences the timing and rate-of-senescence and to compare direct observations of individual plant senescence with mathematical models of onset-of-senescence based on near-surface remote sensing. Our three-year experiment in an Arctic tundra ecosystem altered plant microclimates through factorial warming and earlier snowmelt treatments. We found that (1) early snowmelt and warmer temperatures led to earlier remotely sensed onset-of-senescence, but did not alter the rate-of-senescence, (2) the timing of color change for individual vascular plants did not change in response to the treatments, leading to a mismatch with remotely sensed phenology, and (3) cumulative, phonologically dependent microclimate metrics (e.g., soil cold degree-days) best predicted the onset-of-senescence.

Model experiments run with the Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model using downscaled climate data (variables relating to precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration at 1/8 degrees spatial resolution under four general circulation climate models and two gas emissions scenarios) were used to forecast the abundances of six focal wetland-dependent bird species in the Missouri Coteau portion of the PPR, providing ensemble scenarios at a spatial scale relevant to resource management. Although the projected number of May ponds (waterbodies present during bird breeding season) fluctuated through time with some decadal periodicity (and with the number present in a given year reflecting abundance over the previous three years), the ensemble model average indicated an increase in the average number of waterbodies present by the turn of the next century. Overall, the model experiments conservatively projected an 11.75% increase in the number of waterbodies present by 2090-2099 compared to a baseline period from 1967 to 2005 in the PPR. Wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance were significantly associated with temporal patterns and decadal periodicity in waterbody dynamics. Because of the strong associations between wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance and the number of prairie potholes, projected waterbody increases are forecasted to result in an 11.97% overall increase in occurrence and 8.63% increase in abundance of the six focal species by the end of the 21st century; these results contrast with forecasted drought-associated declines in waterbodies and birds in the PPR.

Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

Remote sensing has been increasingly used in the preventive control strategy. Soil moisture is a major ecological driver of desert locust populations but is still missing in the current imagery toolkit for preventive management. By means of statistical analyses, combining field observations of locust presence/absence and soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution from a disaggregation algorithm, we assess the potential of soil moisture to help preventive management of desert locust. We observe that a soil moisture dynamics increase of above 0.09cm(3)/cm(3) for 20days followed by a decrease of soil moisture may increase the chance to observe locusts 70days later. We estimate the gains in early warning timing compared to using imagery from vegetation to be 3weeks. We demonstrate that forecasting errors may be reduced by the combination of several types of indicators such as soil moisture and vegetation index in a common statistical model forecasting locust presence. Policy implications. Soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution should be used to plan desert locust surveys in preventive management. When soil moisture increases in a dry area of potential habitat for the desert locust, field surveys should be conducted two months later to evaluate the need of further preventive actions. Remote sensing estimates of soil moisture could also be used for other applications of integrated pest management. Foreign Language Abstract Resume La lutte preventive contre le criquet pelerin consiste a detecter le plus tot possible tout debut de pullulation. La teledetection est de plus en plus utilisee dans la strategie de lutte preventive. Bien que l'humidite du sol soit une variable ecologique majeure dans la dynamique des populations de criquet pelerin, elle manque a l'arsenal d'outils de teledetection pour cette strategie preventive. A travers des analyses statistiques qui relient les observations de presence/absence des criquets aux estimations d'humidite du sol a une resolution d'un kilometre issues d'un algorithme de desagregation, nous evaluons le potentiel de cet indicateur dans la gestion preventive du criquet pelerin. Nous observons qu'une augmentation de l'humidite du sol au-dessus de 0.09cm(3)/cm(3) pendant 20 jours suivie d'une diminution augmente les chances d'observer des criquets pelerins 70 jours plus tard. Nous estimons que cet indicateur permet de gagner trois semaines dans l'alerte precoce par rapport a l'utilisation d'indicateurs de vegetation. Nous demontrons que les erreurs de prevision de presence des criquets peuvent etre reduites en combinant dans des modeles statistiques plusieurs types d'indicateurs tels que l'humidite du sol et des indices de vegetation. Implications pour les politiques publiques. Nous recommandons l'utilisation operationnelle des estimations d'humidite du sol a 1 km de resolution dans la lutte preventive contre le criquet pelerin. Quand l'humidite du sol augmente dans une zone aride d'habitat potentiel du criquet pelerin, des prospections acridiennes devraient etre conduites dans les deux mois suivants afin d'evaluer le besoin d'effectuer d'autres mesures preventives.

However, the potential effects of ongoing warming on mesophotic temperate reefs at the community level remain poorly understood. Investigating how different members of these communities will respond to the future expected environmental conditions is, therefore, key to anticipating their future trajectories and developing specific management and conservation strategies. Here, we examined the responses of some of the main components of the highly diverse Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages to thermal stress. We performed thermotolerance experiments with different temperature treatments (from 26 to 29 degrees C) with 10 species from different phyla (three anthozoans, six sponges and one ascidian) and different structural roles. Overall, we observed species-specific contrasting responses to warming regardless of phyla or growth form. Moreover, the responses ranged from highly resistant species to sensitive species and were mostly in agreement with previous field observations from mass mortality events (MMEs) linked to Mediterranean marine heat waves. Our results unravel the diversity of responses to warming in coralligenous outcrops and suggest the presence of potential winners and losers in the face of climate change.

With this expansion, concerns emerged in the 1990s about the fishery's sustainability, especially its impact on the abundant western North American waterbirds that use the lake and feed on brine shrimp. We track the development of management strategies using adaptive management by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR), which focused on the biology of the system and development of biology-based harvesting models. The models and their rationale are presented, their success in forecasting is evaluated, and implications for managing the harvest and conserving waterbirds are examined. We view this as an interesting case study because it transpired over a short time in a relatively simple system. This permitted us to clearly track management from the onset of a harvest market, through realization that the harvest had to be managed in the absence of needed biological knowledge, to the adaptive development of management strategies as biological knowledge was accumulated. The outcome illustrates the success that harvest management can attain with careful monitoring of the resource and terminating the harvest when a necessary escapement stock is attained.",,,,,,Utah Division of Wildlife Resources,Utah Division of Wildlife Resources provided support.

Baseline population estimates, against which future observations may be compared, are necessary if we are to detect ecological change. Arctic sea ice ecosystems are changing rapidly and we lack baseline population estimates for many ice-associated species. Provided we can detect them, changes in Arctic marine ecosystems may be signaled by changes in indicator species such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida). Ringed seal monitoring has provided estimates of survival and fertility rates but these have not been used for population-level inference. Using matrix population models, we synthesized existing demographic parameters to obtain estimates of historical ringed seal population growth and structure in Amundsen Gulf and Prince Albert Sound, Canada. We then formalized existing hypotheses about the effects of emerging environmental stressors (i.e., earlier spring ice breakup and reduced snow depth) on ringed seal pup survival. Coupling the demographic model to ice and snow forecasts available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project resulted in projections of ringed seal population size and structure up to the year 2100. These projections showed median declines in population size ranging from 50% to 99%. Corresponding to these projected declines were substantial changes in population structure, with increasing proportions of ringed seal pups and adults and declining proportions of juveniles. We explored if currently collected, harvest-based data could be used to detect the projected changes in population stage structure. Our model suggests that at a present sample size of 100 seals per year, the projected changes in stage structure would only be reliably detected by mid-century, even for the most extreme climate models. This modeling process revealed inconsistencies in existing estimates of ringed seal demographic rates. Mathematical population models such as these can contribute both to understanding past population trends as well as predicting future ones, both of which are necessary if we are to detect and interpret future observations.",,,,"Derocher, Andrew/J-4469-2012; Reimer, Jody/M-7256-2019","Derocher, Andrew/0000-0002-1104-7774; Reimer, Jody/0000-0001-7742-2728; Caswell, Hal/0000-0003-4394-6894",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alberta Innovates; Killam Trust; ERC Advanced Grant [322989]; ArcticNet; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Hauser Bears; Polar Bears International; Polar Continental Shelf ProjectNatural Resources Canada; Quark Expeditions; World Wildlife Fund (Canada),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Appendix S2: Table S1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

Short-term variability can obscure the importance of slower processes that may ultimately determine the state of a system. Furthermore, management actions with slow responses can be hard to justify. One response to slow processes is to explicitly concentrate analysis on state dynamics. Here, we focus on identifying drivers of Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) territorial occupancy dynamics across 11 study areas spanning their geographic range and forecasting response to potential management actions. Competition with Barred Owls (Strix varia) has increased Spotted Owl territory extinction probabilities across all study areas and driven recent declines in Spotted Owl populations. Without management intervention, the Northern Spotted Owl subspecies will be extirpated from parts of its current range within decades. In the short term, Barred Owl removal can be effective. Over longer time spans, however, maintaining or improving habitat conditions can help promote the persistence of northern spotted owl populations. In most study areas, habitat effects on expected Northern Spotted Owl territorial occupancy are actually greater than the effects of competition from Barred Owls. This study suggests how intensive management actions (removal of a competitor) with rapid results can complement a slower management action (i.e., promoting forest succession).",,,,,"Yackulic, Charles/0000-0001-9661-0724",USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; USDI Bureau of Land Management; USDI National Park Service; Green Diamond Resource Company; Plum Creek Timber Company; Louisiana Pacific Lumber Company; Hancock Forest Management; Bureau of Indian Affairs through the Hoopa Tribe,"Studies on federal lands were primarily funded by the USDA Forest Service, USDI Bureau of Land Management, and USDI National Park Service.

I. C. Nielsen is a plant species native to SW Australia that has recently invaded temperate ecosystems in Europe and other areas in the world. Since it has been found in burnt areas and its expansion could be promoted by forest fires, the germination response of seeds to fire factors (heat, smoke, ash and charcoal) was analyzed. Furthermore, stochastic post-fire invasion models were developed to check the impact of one-off and repeated forest fires. The spreading pattern after fire was modeled to provide accurate forecasts for future fires. The model was parameterized using data recorded after the 2013 forest fire in the Natura 2000 site Monte Pindo. Germination response is mainly modified by heat, which breaks seed dormancy at moderate temperature and kills seeds at high temperatures. Smoke, ash and charcoal did not have relevant influence on seed germination except large amounts of ash, which prevented seed germination. Neither charcoal origin (from native or from exotic species) had a significant effect on P. lophantha germination. The invasion model demonstrated the significant role of forest fires promoting P. lophantha spreading. Recurrent fires promote the spreading of invasive species, threatening natural plant communities. However, the expansion of the species was not exclusively linked to forest fires: anthropic systems, edges of agricultural areas and old fields were particularly affected by P. lophantha expansion. Some control methods based on the reproductive behavior and spreading pattern of P. lophantha were proposed in order to prevent new invasions and manage invaded areas.",,,,"Cruz, Oscar/V-3949-2017","Cruz, Oscar/0000-0001-8010-9978; Cruz, Oscar/0000-0002-7661-0724","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the framework of the GESFIRE projectEuropean Union (EU) [AGL2013-48189-C2-2-R]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the framework of the FIRESEVES projectEuropean Union (EU) [AGL2017-86075-C2-2-R]","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the framework of the GESFIRE (AGL2013-48189-C2-2-R) and FIRESEVES (AGL2017-86075-C2-2-R) projects.

Results We recorded totals of 363 plant and 227 ant species. Alignment between plant and ant communities was high, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the structuring of plant and ant communities in relation to environmental variation.

This study evaluates the ability of habitat-based density models to accurately forecast cetacean abundance and distribution during a novel year with unprecedented warm ocean temperatures caused by a sustained marine heatwave. Location California Current Ecosystem, USA. Methods We constructed generalized additive models based on cetacean sighting and environmental data from 1991 to 2009 for eight species with a diverse range of habitat associations. Models were built with three different sets of predictor variables to compare performance. Models were then used to forecast species abundance and distribution patterns during 2014, a year with anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Cetacean sighting data collected during 2014 were used to assess model forecasts. Results Ratios of model-predicted abundance to observed abundance were close to 1:1 for all but one species and accurately captured changes in the number of animals in the study area during the anomalous year. Predicted distribution patterns also showed good concordance with the 2014 survey observations. Our results indicate that habitat relationships were captured sufficiently to predict both changes in abundance and shifts in distribution when conditions warmed, for both cool- and warm-temperate species. Main conclusions Models built with multidecadal datasets were able to forecast abundance and distribution in a novel warm year for a diverse set of cetacean species. Models with the best explanatory power did not necessarily have the best predictive power. Also, they revealed species-specific responses to warming ocean waters.

Importantly, interactions between coinfecting parasites can be affected by the order in which they infect hosts (i.e. within-host priority effects). In this study, we use a single-host, two-pathogen, SI model with environmental transmission to explore how within-host priority effects scale up to alter host population-scale infection patterns. Specifically, we ask how parasite prevalence changes in the presence of different types of priority effects. We consider two scenarios without priority effects and four scenarios with priority effects where there is either an advantage or a disadvantage to being the first to infect in a coinfected host. Models without priority effects always predict negative relationships between the prevalences of both parasites. In contrast, models with priority effects can yield unimodal prevalence relationships where the prevalence of a focal parasite is minimized or maximized at intermediate prevalences of a coinfecting parasite. The mechanism behind this pattern is that as the prevalence of the coinfecting parasite increases, most infections of the focal parasite change from occurring as solo infections, to first arrival coinfections, to second arrival coinfections. The corresponding changes in parasite fitness as the focal parasite moves from one infection class to another then map to changes in focal parasite prevalence. Further, we found that even when parasites interact negatively within a host, they still can have positive prevalence relationships at the population scale. These results suggest that within-host priority effects can change host population-scale infection patterns in systematic (and initially counterintuitive) ways, and that taking them into account may improve disease forecasting in coinfected populations.",,,,,"Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1601353, DEB-1748729, DEB-1748848, DEB-1655626]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This project was supported by NSF grants (DEB-1601353, DEB-1748729, DEB-1748848, DEB-1655626), by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.",,,5,5,3,10,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2019,128,4,,,,,571,583,,10.1111/oik.05937,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000462902200011,,,,,

Climate manipulations can manifest in complex ways, however, challenging interpretations of biological responses. We reviewed publications to compile a database of daily plot-scale climate data from 15 active-warming experiments. We find that the common practices of analysing treatments as mean or categorical changes (e.g. warmed vs. unwarmed) masks important variation in treatment effects over space and time. Our synthesis showed that measured mean warming, in plots with the same target warming within a study, differed by up to 1.6 circle C (63% of target), on average, across six studies with blocked designs. Variation was high across sites and designs: for example, plots differed by 1.1 circle C (47% of target) on average, for infrared studies with feedback control (n = 3) vs. by 2.2 circle C (80% of target) on average for infrared with constant wattage designs (n = 2). Warming treatments produce non-temperature effects as well, such as soil drying. The combination of these direct and indirect effects is complex and can have important biological consequences. With a case study of plant phenology across five experiments in our database, we show how accounting for drier soils with warming tripled the estimated sensitivity of budburst to temperature. We provide recommendations for future analyses, experimental design, and data sharing to improve our mechanistic understanding from climate change experiments, and thus their utility to accurately forecast species' responses.",,,,"Dukes, Jeffrey/AAD-8791-2019; Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012","Wolkovich, Elizabeth M/0000-0001-7653-893X; Ettinger, Ailene/0000-0002-6228-6732",Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF DBI 14-01854],"We are grateful to those who shared their experimental climate data with us, allowing them to be included in the MC3E database.

This greatly limits how empirical data can be used to improve model performance and reduce the uncertainty associated with their predictions of carbon (C) cycling. Recent advances in our understanding of the biogeochemical processes that govern SOM formation and persistence demand a new mathematical model with a structure built around key mechanisms and biogeochemically relevant pools. Here, we present one approach that aims to address this need. Our new model (MEMS v1.0) is developed from the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework, which emphasizes the importance of linking the chemistry of organic matter inputs with efficiency of microbial processing and ultimately with the soil mineral matrix, when studying SOM formation and stabilization. Building on this framework, MEMS v1.0 is also capable of simulating the concept of C saturation and represents decomposition processes and mechanisms of physico-chemical stabilization to define SOM formation into four primary fractions. After describing the model in detail, we optimize four key parameters identified through a variance-based sensitivity analysis. Optimization employed soil fractionation data from 154 sites with diverse environmental conditions, directly equating mineral-associated organic matter and particulate organic matter fractions with corresponding model pools. Finally, model performance was evaluated using total topsoil (0-20 cm) C data from 8192 forest and grassland sites across Europe. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, it was able to accurately capture general trends in soil C stocks across extensive gradients of temperature, precipitation, annual C inputs and soil texture. The novel approach that MEMS v1.0 takes to simulate SOM dynamics has the potential to improve our forecasts of how soils respond to management and environmental perturbation. Ensuring these forecasts are accurate is key to effectively informing policy that can address the sustainability of ecosystem services and help mitigate climate change.",,,,"Wallenstein, Matthew D/S-3512-2016; lugato, emanuele/F-6947-2010","Wallenstein, Matthew D/0000-0002-6219-1442; lugato, emanuele/0000-0002-8947-352X",National Science Foundation CAREER grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [255228]; US DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy programme (ROOTS project) [DE-FOA-00001565]; NSF-DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1743237]; JRCEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [D.B720517],"This research was supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER grant (number 255228) awarded to MDW, the US DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy programme (ROOTS project; DE-FOA-00001565), the NSF-DEB award no. 1743237 and the JRC (purchase order D.B720517).

To this end, we tested the application of GPT2w, an empirical model originally developed for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) meteorology. By using the GPT2w model, and starting from measured surface meteorological data (air pressure, temperature, and relative humidity), estimators of air temperature and dew-point air temperature at different pressure levels were generated. The selected testing area was a region of South America that included most of the Rio de la Plata drainage basin, along with two hazardous areas: Sierras de Cordoba in Argentina and Serra da Canastra in Brazil. This region was chosen due to the availability of the radiosonde launches required for comparison during 2016. Results: To characterize the regional performance of HI, we used data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast's (ECMWF) reanalysis model (ERA Interim; Dee et al., Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 137: 553-597, 2011) for the period 2000 to 2016. A statistical analysis of the differences between the simulated HI from GPT2w (HI_GPT2w) and the HI values derived from radiosonde measurements (HI_R) was performed. The results showed that HI_GPT2w reproduced HI_R values about 50% of the time, most accurately for low-severity HI values (2 to 3, on a scale of 2 to 6). In general, HI_GPT2w exhibited an underestimation of HI that increased as the index value increased. We analyzed how this underestimation affected the different HI variants calculated. To this end, we recall that each HI variant results from the sum of the stability and moisture terms. The stability term resulted from the temperature difference at different pressure levels while the moisture term is represented by the dew-point depression. Thus, the pressure level limits in the stability term define the HI variant. In this study, we used the Low-variant HI (950 and 850 hPa) and the Mid-variant HI (850 and 700 hPa). If we analyze this underestimation according to the HI variants, the moisture term is responsible for the Low variant underestimation and the stability term is responsible for the Mid variant. Conclusion: The simple application of GPT2w to extrapolate the vertical values of temperature and its dew-point depression is not enough to reproduce the Haines Index as it was measured from radiosonde measurements. Nevertheless, an improved application of GPT2w and the extrapolated saturation water vapor pressure by using the Integrated Water Vapor from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS-IWV) values could improve the results.",,,,,"Aragon Paz, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-9865-4974",National Scientific and Technical Council of Argentina (CONICET) [PIP 112-201201-00292]; La Plata National University (UNLP)National University of La Plata [11G/142],This research was supported by the National Scientific and Technical Council of Argentina (CONICET) PIP 112-201201-00292 and La Plata National University (UNLP) project 11G/142.,,,0,0,0,2,,,,1933-9747,,,FIRE ECOL,Fire Ecol.,22-Mar,2019,15,,,,,,,,UNSP 6,10.1186/s42408-018-0014-8,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,,WOS:000462319500001,,,,,

To understand the biological response mechanisms along coastlines, the international scientific community requires coordinated action, integrating obervations through observatory networks and spatially extensive experiments using standardized approaches over broad geographic scales. Currently, however, a multinational, integrated approach is lacking, with little application of standard methodologies or data sharing across countries. Changes in the abundance, distribution and competitive dominance of rocky intertidal organisms are useful sentinels of climate change because these communities are easy to observe and long-term time series exist. Europe is in a prime position to lead by example, building on the extensive history of sustained observations and experimental research to establish an integrated network of studies and monitoring programmes.

Understanding these impacts is therefore essential for managing ecosystems and sustaining human well-being. Here, we conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater studies to identify key gaps in our knowledge of climate change impacts on food webs and determine whether the areas currently studied are those most likely to be impacted by climate change. We found research suffers from a strong geographic bias, with only 3.5% of studies occurring in the tropics. Importantly, the distribution of sites sampled under projected climate changes was biased-areas with decreases or large increases in precipitation and areas with low magnitudes of temperature change were under-represented. Our results suggest that understanding of climate change impacts on food webs could be broadened by considering more than two trophic levels, responses in addition to species abundance and biomass, impacts of a wider suite of climatic variables, and tropical ecosystems.

This work focuses specifically on the California chaparral, which until recently has been considered resistant to invasion by exotic grasses, but in recent years appears to have undergone substantial type conversion. Objectives To synthesize current understanding of the feedbacks and anthropogenic impacts that both enhance and reduce the susceptibility of southern California chaparral to invasion and its corresponding ability to recolonize invaded areas. Methods We review the existing literature pertaining to the factors that enhance or reduce the susceptibility of chaparral to invasion, and organize these factors and their interactions into a single unified framework of environmental drivers, ecological interactions, and historical legacies associated with the distribution and rate of such invasion. Results A myriad of processes interact to mediate the invasion of exotic grasses into intact chaparral. In addition, we demonstrate that feedbacks exist within both chaparral shrublands and exotic grasslands that modify the landscape in ways that can enhance their own survival, act as barriers to conversion into alternate cover types, and in some cases weaken the resistance of adjacent vegetation to invasion. We posit a methodological framework from which the many climatic, anthropogenic, edaphic, and biotic feedbacks that determine the mosaic of invasion can be modeled. Conclusions This study demonstrates that substantial conversion of chaparral into deciduous grasslands has recently occurred in southern California and presents a unified framework for forecasting the dynamics of shrub-grass conversion throughout Mediterranean-climate shrublands.",,,,,"Park, Isaac/0000-0001-5539-1641",US Forest serviceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [11-CS-11050100-031]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1656062]; UC-Riverside [11-CS-11050100-031],This research was funded through a cooperative agreement between UC-Riverside and the US Forest service (Grant No. 11-CS-11050100-031) and the National Science Foundation (DEB-1656062).,,,1,1,32,108,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate ecosystems where the warmest temperatures and greatest moisture availability are seasonally asynchronous. We examined plant phenological responses at both the population and community levels to four climate treatments (control, warming, drought, and warming plus additional precipitation) embedded within three prairies across a 520 km latitudinal Mediterranean climate gradient within the Pacific Northwest, USA. At the population level, we monitored flowering and abundances in spring 2017 of eight range-restricted focal species planted both within and north of their current ranges. At the community level, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured from fall 2016 to summer 2018 to estimate peak live biomass, senescence, seasonal patterns, and growing season length. We found that warming exerted a stronger control than our moisture manipulations on phenology at both the population and community levels. Warming advanced flowering regardless of whether a species was within or beyond its current range. Importantly, many of our focal species had low abundances, particularly in the south, suggesting that establishment, in addition to phenological shifts, may be a strong constraint on their future viability. At the community level, warming advanced the date of peak biomass regardless of site or year. The date of senescence advanced regardless of year for the southern and central sites but only in 2018 for the northern site. Growing season length contracted due to warming at the southern and central sites (similar to 3 weeks) but was unaffected at the northern site. Our results emphasize that future temperature changes may exert strong influence on the timing of a variety of plant phenological events, especially those events that occur when temperature is most limiting, even in seasonally water-limited Mediterranean ecosystems.",,,,"Reed, Paul/AAI-9731-2020; Bridgham, Scott/R-1557-2017","Bridgham, Scott/0000-0003-0614-2678",Division of Emerging FrontiersNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1340847],"Division of Emerging Frontiers, Grant/Award Number: 1340847",,,1,1,3,9,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Using dendrometers, we measured fine-scale growth for 96 trees of 25 species from 2013 to 2016 in an everwet forest in Puerto Rico. Rainfall over this time span varied, including an unusual, severe El Nino drought in 2015. We assessed how growing season onset, median day, conclusion, and length varied with absolute growth rate and tree size over time. Stem growth was seasonal, beginning in February, peaking in July, and ending in November. Species growth rates varied between 0 and 8 mm/year and correlated weakly with specific leaf area, leaf phosphorus, and leaf nitrogen, and to a lesser degree with wood specific gravity and plant height. Drought and tree growth were decoupled, and drought lengthened and increased variation in growing season length. During the 2015 drought, many trees terminated growth early but did not necessarily grow less. In the year following drought, trees grew more over a shorter growing season, with many smaller trees showing a post-drought increase in growth. We attribute the increased growth of smaller trees to release from light limitation as the canopy thinned because of the drought, and less inferred hydraulic stress than larger trees during drought. Soil type accounted for interannual and interspecific differences, with the finest Zarzal clays reducing tree growth. We conclude that drought affects the phenological timing of tree growth and favors the post-drought growth of smaller, sub-canopy trees in this everwet forest. in Spanish is available with online material.",,,,"Enquist, Brian J./B-6436-2008; Hogan, J.

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform. Iterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modelling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts. The forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models. Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise ranging from field site experience to software development.

Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modeling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed approximate Bayesian computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from 10 yr of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics (initial dynamics after disease emergence). Only 21% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 yr following devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 yr, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.",,,,"Hohenlohe, Paul/AAE-7744-2019; Wells, Konstans/A-7232-2010; McCallum, Hamish/E-1638-2013","Hohenlohe, Paul/0000-0002-7616-0161; Wells, Konstans/0000-0003-0377-2463; McCallum, Hamish/0000-0002-3493-0412; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Hamede, Rodrigo/0000-0003-1526-225X","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1316549]; National Institutes of Health (NIH), NIH-NSF-U.S. Department of Agriculture Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program, NIH [R01 GM126563-01, P30GM103324]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110102656, FT100100250, DE17010116, LP0561120, LP0989613]; Fulbright Scholarship Scheme; Ian Potter Foundation; Australian Academy of Science (Margaret Middleton Fund); Estate of W.V.

Habitat suitability models are fundamental to developing this understanding; however their use in management continues to be limited due to often-vague model objectives and inadequate evaluation methods. Along the Northeast Pacific coast, canopy kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkeana) provide biogenic habitat and considerable primary production to nearshore ecosystems. We investigated the distribution of these species by examining a series of increasingly complex habitat suitability models ranging from process-based models based on species' ecology to complex generalised additive models applied to purpose-collected survey data. Seeking empirical limits to model complexity, we explored the relationship between model complexity and forecast skill, measured using both cross-validation and independent data evaluation. Our analysis confirmed the importance of predictors used in models of coastal kelp distributions developed elsewhere (i.e. depth, bottom type, bottom slope, and exposure); it also identified additional important factors including salinity, and potential interactions between exposure and salinity, and slope and tidal energy. Comparative results showed how cross-validation can lead to over-fitting, while independent data evaluation clearly identified the appropriate model complexity for generating habitat forecasts. Our results also illustrate that, depending on the evaluation data, predictions from simpler models can out-perform those from more complex models. Collectively, the insights from evaluating multiple models with multiple data sets contribute to the holistic assessment of model forecast skill. The continued development of methods and metrics for evaluating model forecasts with independent data, and the explicit consideration of model objectives and assumptions, promise to increase the utility of model forecasts to decision makers.",,,,"Chan, Kai/C-1682-2009","Chan, Kai/0000-0002-7804-3276","NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [17R43675, 17R82930]; Canada Research Chairs programCanada Research Chairs; CFI Leaders Opportunity FundCanada Foundation for Innovation [17R39196]","PThis research was funded by NSERC through Strategic Projects Grant UBC # 17R43675, Discovery Grant UBC # 17R82930, and a Canadian Graduate Scholarship to EJG.

ENM applications frequently involve transferring models calibrated with environmental data from one region to other regions or times that may include novel environmental conditions. When novel conditions are present, transferability implies extrapolation, whereas, in absence of such conditions, transferability is an interpolation step only. We evaluated transferability of models produced using 11 ENM algorithms from the perspective of interpolation and extrapolation in a virtual species framework. We defined fundamental niches and potential distributions of 16 virtual species distributed across Eurasia. To simulate real situations of incomplete understanding of species' distribution or existing fundamental niche (environmental conditions suitable for the species contained in the study area; N*(F)), we divided Eurasia into six regions and used 1-5 regions for model calibration and the rest for model evaluation. The models produced with the 11 ENM algorithms were evaluated in environmental space, to complement the traditional geographic evaluation of models. None of the algorithms accurately estimated the existing fundamental niche (N*(F)) given one region in calibration, and model evaluation scores decreased as the novelty of the environments in the evaluation regions increased. Thus, we recommend quantifying environmental similarity between calibration and transfer regions prior to model transfer, providing an avenue for assessing uncertainty of model transferability. Different algorithms had different sensitivity to completeness of knowledge of N*(F), with implications for algorithm selection. If the goal is to reconstruct fundamental niches, users should choose algorithms with limited extrapolation when N*(F) is well known, or choose algorithms with increased extrapolation when N*(F) is poorly known. Our assessment can inform applications of ecological niche modeling transference to anticipate species invasions into novel areas, disease emergence in new regions, and forecasts of species distributions under future climate conditions.",,,,"; Peterson, A.

Such efforts can help meet many related goals, including habitat creation, ecosystem service provisioning, assisted migration, and the reintroduction of imperiled species following local extirpation. The outcomes of reintroduction efforts, however, are highly variable, with results ranging from local extinction to dramatic population growth; reasons for this variation remain unclear. Here, we ask whether population growth following plant reintroductions is governed by variation at two scales: the scale of individual habitat patches to which individuals are reintroduced, and larger among-landscape scales in which similar patches may be situated in landscapes that differ in matrix type, soil conditions, and other factors. Quantifying demographic variation at these two scales will help prioritize locations for introduction and, once introductions take place, forecast population growth. This work took place within a large-scale habitat fragmentation experiment, where individuals of two perennial forb species were reintroduced into eight replicate similar to 50-ha landscapes, each containing a set of five similar to 1-ha patches that varied in their degree of isolation (connected by habitat corridors or unconnected) and edge-to-area ratio. Using data on individual growth, survival, reproductive output, and recruitment collected one to two years after reintroduction, we developed models to forecast population growth, then compared forecasts to observed population sizes, three and six years later. Both the type of patch (connected and unconnected) and identity of the landscape to which individuals were reintroduced had effects on forecasted population growth rates, but only variation associated with landscape identity was an accurate predictor of subsequently observed population growth rates. Models that did not include landscape identity had minimal forecasting ability, revealing the key importance of variation at this scale for accurate prediction. Of the five demographic rates used to model population dynamics, seed production was the most important source of forecast error in population growth rates. Our results point to the importance of accounting for landscape-scale variation in demographic models and demonstrate how such models might assist with prioritizing particular landscapes for species reintroduction projects.",,,,,"Caughlin, T.

Tree mortality is a complex process influenced by climate, soils, characteristics of individual trees, interactions between trees, and the dynamics of pests and pathogens. The role of stand structure and stand density in mediating the resistance of trees to drought remains poorly understood, especially in semiarid woodlands, which are expected to be highly susceptible to future severe drought. We sampled permanent plots in central Nevada woodlands dominated by single-leaf pinyon pine and Utah juniper before and after a severe multi-year drought (2013-2015) to investigate the importance of climate, tree attributes, and local-neighborhood stand structure on tree mortality and canopy dieback at the level of individual trees and 0.1-ha plots. We observed widespread tree mortality of pinyon at approximately eight times the reported background mortality rate, and substantial canopy dieback in both pinyon and juniper. Both species were more prone to mortality and dieback in hotter, drier sites. Canopy dieback was associated with both long-term average climate and the severity of recent drought, with elevated mortality on sites with higher water deficits, average summer temperatures, and vapor pressure deficits. Soils also played a role in tree dieback, with greater mortality on deeper soils. While mortality was driven largely by climate at coarse scales, fine-scale stand structure interacted with climate to mediate mortality and dieback. Neighborhood statistics showed that trees were susceptible to competitive influence, and pinyon trees were especially sensitive to neighborhood density on drier sites. Mortality and dieback were associated with diverse, co-occurring insect and parasitic plant mortality agents. Canopy dieback prior to the drought was strongly associated with tree mortality during the drought, implying that current widespread defoliation caused by these agents may foreshadow future elevated woodland decline. Fine-scale influences such as stand structure and soil characteristics play a key role in the long-term dynamics of semiarid woodlands, and these factors should be considered in predictive models of forest and woodland susceptibility to drought.",,,,"Flake, Samuel/O-3284-2019","Flake, Samuel/0000-0002-0404-5236","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1003021]","We thank David L.

Yet most forecasts of species' distributions under climate change have ignored local adaptation (LA), which may paint a false picture of how species will respond across their geographic ranges. We review recent studies that have incorporated intraspecific variation, a potential proxy for LA, into distribution forecasts, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make recommendations for how to improve forecasts in the face of LA. The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade-off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate. We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the confounding effects of LA to nonclimatic or biotic drivers, and the need to incorporate empirically based dispersal or gene flow processes. We suggest approaches to better evaluate these aspects of LA and their effects on species-level forecasts. In particular, we highlight demographic and dynamic evolutionary models as promising approaches to better integrate LA into forecasts, and emphasize the importance of independent model validation. Finally, we urge closer examination of how LA will alter the responses of central vs. marginal populations to allow stronger generalizations about changes in distribution and abundance in the face of LA.",,,,,"Peterson, Megan/0000-0002-5010-2721","Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1242355, 1340024, 1353781, 1753954]","Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1242355, 1340024, 1353781 and 1753954",,,12,12,17,50,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

A limitation of many models is they are amechanistic and lack integration of behavior, which is fundamental to animal biology. We integrated biophysical and agent-based models (ABM) to examine how behavior could affect the sensitivity of Plethodontid salamander activity time to climate. Specifically, ourmodel used a temperature differential to stimulate plant climbing, a widely observed behavior among salamanders, which would allow salamanders to reduce body temperatures and associated dehydration rates. Consistent with expectations, predicted activity time was positively correlated with precipitation. The model showed that climbing plants increased activity time in drier conditions, particularly for smaller salamanders. The predicted importance of climbing behavior, a form of behavioral plasticity, was highly sensitive to assumptions about the threshold of water loss an individual was willing to tolerate. Because activity time is associated with fitness, increased activity time as a consequence of climbing behavior could moderate salamander sensitivity to shifts in weather patterns. Our results demonstrate the potential and importance of integrating behaviors into ecophysiological models when evaluating a species' potential sensitivity to climate.",,,,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0823293, DEB-1637522]; Daniel B.

In this study, we measured leaf nutrients along a transect across a groundwater depth gradient in the downstream Heihe River to explore the response of leaf nutrient traits to groundwater depth and soil properties. We found that leaf nutrient traits of dominant species showed different responses to groundwater depth gradient. Leaf C, leaf N, leaf P, and leaf K decreased significantly with groundwater depth, whereas patterns of leaf C/N and leaf N/P followed quadratic relationships with groundwater depth. Meanwhile, leaf C/P did not vary significantly along the groundwater depth gradient. Variations in leaf nutrient traits were associated with soil properties (e.g., soil bulk density, soil pH). Groundwater depth and soil pH jointly regulated the variation of leaf nutrient traits; however, groundwater depth explained the variation of leaf nutrient traits better than did soil pH. At the local scale in the typical desert riparian ecosystem, the dominant species was characterized by low leaf C, leaf N, and leaf P, but high leaf N/P and leaf C/P, indicating that desert riparian plants might be more limited by P than N in the growing season. Our observations will help to reveal specific adaptation patterns in relation to the groundwater depth gradient for dominant desert riparian species, provide insights into adaptive trends of leaf nutrient traits, and add information relevant to understanding the adaptive strategies of desert riparian forest vegetation to moisture gradients.",,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [91425301],"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 91425301",,,1,1,2,7,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

One factor thought to be positively related to stand productivity is the degree of asymmetry, or the slope of the relationship between tree size and biomass growth. Steeper slopes indicate disproportionate productivity of big trees relative to small trees. Theoretically, big trees outcompete smaller trees during favorable growth conditions because they maintain better access to light. For this reason, high productivity forests are expected to have asymmetric growth. However, empirical studies do not consistently support this expectation, and those that do are limited in spatial or temporal scope. Here, we analyze size-growth relationships from 1970 to 2011 across a diverse network of forest sites in the eastern United States (n=16) to test whether asymmetry is consistently related to productivity. To investigate this relationship, we analyze asymmetry-productivity relationships between our 16 forests at non-overlapping annual, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year sampling intervals and find that asymmetry is negatively related to productivity, but the strength depends on the specific interval considered. Within-site temporal variability in asymmetry and productivity are generally positively correlated over time, except at the 5-year remeasurement interval. Rather than confirming or failing to support a positive relationship between asymmetry and productivity, our findings suggest caution interpreting these metrics since the relationship varies across forest types and temporal scales.",,,,"Druckenbrod, Daniel L/L-4717-2013","Druckenbrod, Daniel/0000-0003-2998-0017; Bishop, Daniel/0000-0002-0394-5996",National Science Foundation MacroSystems Biology Grant [1241930]; Department of Energy Global Climate Modeling program [SC0016011]; Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation,Funding for this work was generously contributed by: National Science Foundation MacroSystems Biology Grant #1241930; the Department of Energy Global Climate Modeling program SC0016011; and the Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation.,,,4,4,0,8,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2019,189,2,,,,,515,528,,10.1007/s00442-018-4318-9,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000460033700020,30515662,,,,

However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warmingas is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn monthson autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4 degrees C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group.

However, the implementation of PAs does not always mitigate the impacts of human occupation such as biological invasions and climatic changes. We evaluated the effect of the invasion of Artocarpus heterophyllus, the jackfruit, over Atlantic Forest PAs, under the influence of climate changes and across scales. The environmental suitability of jackfruit for preindustrial, future (2080), and delta (=future-preindustrial) was used to establish the risk of invasiveness. To validate the hypothesis that PAs have higher jackfruit invasiveness than usual in preindustrial, future, and delta periods, we used a null model. We conducted a phytosociological study in Guariru Natural Heritage Private Reserve (NHPR) for evaluating the effect of jackfruit on species richness. The Atlantic Forest PAs have higher jackfruit environmental suitability than expected for both preindustrial, future, and delta periods. In Guariru NHPR, the presence of jackfruit was inversely proportional to the species richness. The combined effect of jackfruit invasion and climatic changes showed that the Atlantic Forest PAs are threatened by the effect of jackfruit competitive pressure over native species, thus dominating ecosystems both by density and biomass, in preindustrial, and under climate changes. Guariru NHPR is already losing its biodiversity through the presence of jackfruit, needing management interventions. We strongly recommend that to combat the occurrence of jackfruit in Atlantic Forest PAs, management interventions should be taken to control its persistence, also delineating its role inside the community structure.",,,,"de Oliveira, Guilherme/S-1531-2019; Caiafa, Alessandra/AAM-2068-2020",,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [442103/2014-0]; Incentive Program for Atlantic Forest Natural Heritage Private Reserves; MCTIC/CNPq [465610/2014-5]; FAPEG,"This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [442103/2014-0], and Incentive Program for Atlantic Forest Natural Heritage Private Reserves, coordinated by Conservation International Brasil, Fundacao SOS Mata Atlantica, and The Nature Conservancy [Ed.

Typically, this rationale is implicit in sourcing one critical thermal maximum (CTmax) population estimate per species to model spatiotemporal cross-taxa variation in heat tolerance. Theory suggests that such an approach could result in biased or imprecise estimates and forecasts of impact from climate warming, but limited empirical evidence in support of those expectations exists. We experimentally quantify the magnitude of intraspecific variation in CTmax among lizard populations, and the extent to which incorporating such variability can alter estimates of climate impact through a biophysical model. To do so, we measured CTmax from 59 populations of 15 Iberian lizard species (304 individuals). The overall median CTmax across all individuals from all species was 42.8 degrees C and ranged from 40.5 to 48.3 degrees C, with species medians decreasing through xeric, climate-generalist and mesic taxa. We found strong statistical support for intraspecific differentiation in CTmax by up to a median of 3 degrees C among populations. We show that annual restricted activity (operative temperature > CTmax) over the Iberian distribution of our study species differs by a median of >80 hr per 25-km(2) grid cell based on different population-level CTmax estimates. This discrepancy leads to predictions of spatial variation in annual restricted activity to change by more than 20 days for six of the study species. Considering that during restriction periods, reptiles should be unable to feed and reproduce, current projections of climate-change impacts on the fitness of ectotherm fauna could be under- or over-estimated depending on which population is chosen to represent the physiological spectra of the species in question. Mapping heat tolerance over the full geographical ranges of single species is thus critical to address cross-taxa patterns and drivers of heat tolerance in a biologically comprehensive way.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Gomes, Veronica/I-3662-2014","Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Herrando-Perez, Salvador/0000-0001-6052-6854; Vieites, David/0000-0001-5551-7419; Gomes, Veronica/0000-0002-3179-2691",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2011-26852]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [IC&DT 1/SAESCTN/ALENT-07-0224-FEDER-001755]; British Ecological Society [4496-5470]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170101046],"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant Number: CGL2011-26852; European Union, Grant Number: IC&DT 1/SAESCTN/ALENT-07-0224-FEDER-001755; British Ecological Society, Grant Number: 4496-5470; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP170101046",,,7,7,10,32,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests worldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently ecosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly due to the complexity of the interaction between individual components involved. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a stochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction between the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the propagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Our quantitative results indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable phases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on the density of the susceptible individuals. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework early-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on dynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the critical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the epiphytotic regime. Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be useful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and computational models suited to more specific pathogen-host-environmental interactions. Our results may also be useful to identify a suitable planting density to slow down disease spread and in the future, design highly resilient forests.",,,,"Parker, Nicholas G/E-4753-2011","Parker, Nicholas G/0000-0002-7238-8492; Smith, James/0000-0002-7465-6067","DefraDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Newcastle University","We thank Dr. Willem Roelofs, Dr. Alan Macleod and Dr. Sam Grant for interesting discussions, and financial support from Defra and Newcastle University, through a Newcastle University Strategic Impact Award.

This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.",,,,"Orr, Michael/AAF-7232-2019","Orr, Michael/0000-0002-9096-3008; Riemer, Kristina/0000-0003-3802-3331; White, Ethan/0000-0001-6728-7745; Taylor, Shawn/0000-0002-6178-6903; Meiners, Joan/0000-0001-9369-9313",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative [GBMF4563]; University of Florida Biodiversity Institute Graduate Research Fellowship; National Science Foundation's (NSF) LTER Program [DEB-1440409]; U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Oregon State University; Jornada Basin LTER project (NSF Grant) [DEB-1235828],"This research was supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through Grant GBMF4563 to E.

However, quantifications of biotic interactions frequently overlook demographic variabilities within populations, which can modulate interaction strengths, such as sex and reproductive status. Compositional population ratios between males and females, alongside reproductive status, are highly variable temporally in ephemeral aquatic systems, and may profoundly mediate levels of ecological impact and thus stability of trophic groups. In the present study, we apply functional responses (resource intake as a function of resource density) to quantify predatory impacts of adult males, non-gravid females, and gravid females of the calanoid copepod Lovenula raynerae (Diaptomidae), an abundant ephemeral pond specialist, on larvae of the Culex pipiens (Culicidae) mosquito complex. We then develop a novel metric to forecast population-level impacts across different population sex ratio scenarios. Lovenula raynerae demonstrated prey population destabilising Type II functional responses irrespective of sex and reproductive status, yet variable functional response magnitudes were found. While male and non-gravid female copepods exhibited similar functional response maximum feeding rates, gravid female feeding rates were substantially higher, implying higher resource demands for progeny development. Ecological impacts of L. raynerae on lower trophic groups increased markedly where their abundances increased but, crucially, also as population sex ratios became more biased towards gravid female copepods. We demonstrate that population-level impacts do not only correlate tightly with abundance but may be further modulated by reproductive status variations. Thus, the development of sex-skewed ratios in favour of gravid females during the hydroperiod probably heightens ecological impacts on lower trophic groups. The implications of these results for prey population stability are discussed in the context of freshwater ecosystems.",,,,"Dalu, Tatenda/K-3089-2012; Weyl, Olaf/B-8996-2009","Dalu, Tatenda/0000-0002-9019-7702; Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Callaghan, Amanda/0000-0002-2731-3352; Wasserman, Ryan/0000-0002-4162-1503; Froneman, William/0000-0003-0615-1355","South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology [110507]; Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland","South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: 110507; Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland",,,6,6,1,9,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

To study the influence of the impounding process during the flood season on algal blooms in Xiangxi Bay (XXB), monitoring of XXB was conducted from June 18, 2017 to July 18, 2017. Based on a laterally averaged two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) of XXB, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in flow, water temperature, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) during the impounding process. The results showed that during the impounding process, the total Chl-a in the euphotic zone of XXB (SA) decreased obviously compared with that on July 1.

To study the methodological foundations and main provisions of a new vector of economic development, the ""ecological economy"", as being the most important aspect of the Global Commons ideology. Material and Methods. The study was conducted using a range of theoretical research methods, including analysis, deduction and forecasting. Discussion. The basis of the Global Commons ideology is considered to be the ""green economy"", a new technological modality, the purpose of which is the careful and rational utilisation of available resources employing high technologies for the maximum satisfaction of people's needs. Proponents of the Global Commons ideology advocate the ecology or the environment as the dominant factors in sustainable socio-economic development. At the same time, the environmental policy of the developed world also represents a new form of neocolonialism directed at the takeover of strategic natural resources of underdeveloped countries, while restricting their rights to technological and social development. It may even be aimed at the military or economic capture of national natural and biological resources. All this challenges individual state sovereignty and may lead to a fundamentally new type of conflict in the future. Conclusions. The formation of the ""ecological economy"" is a new vector of sustainable socio-economic development in the Global Commons ideology, requiring our governmental authorities to take the necessary organizational, military, managerial and regulatory measures to realize the nation's competitive advantages, to conserve its natural potential, to block non-residents from capturing national wealth and to organise an effective system of environmental security.",,,,,"Akhmedova, Khamida/0000-0003-2442-9955; Trofimov, Mihail/0000-0002-7194-0468",,,,,0,0,1,1,,,,1992-1098,2413-0958,,S RUSS-ECOL DEV,South Russ.-Ecol.

A system of differential equations is used for the building of model. Data of the areas of different-age pine, larch, birch and aspen forests, the cutting area at the time of forest management, the current annual allowable cut, as well as recommendations for reforestation on felled areas with different initial composition of the timber stand were used as the predictors for modeling. The consequences of the possible use of other recommended calculations of annual allowable cut in the forest practice (the first and second age-, integral annual allowable cut) were also analyzed in the modeling.

Second, long-term studies often inherently lead to novel insights. Finally, long-term field studies can serve as model systems for population biology, allowing for theory and methods to be tested under well-characterized conditions. We illustrate these ideas in three long-term field systems that have made outsized contributions to our understanding of population ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. We then highlight three emerging areas to which long-term field studies are well positioned to contribute in the future: ecological forecasting, genomics, and macrosystems ecology.

Traditionally, prediction of breeding values of male small horned ruminants (rams) by referring to levels of economically useful traits of their progeny is carried out by methods of statistical analysis. However, at the same time, there is a forecasting method based on the use of a mixed biometric model. The solution of the system of equations constituting a mixed biometric model is associated with certain difficulties caused by the peculiarity of the system matrix. It is proposed to use integrated mathematical packages in the forecast, by which the system of equations can be solved in several ways, followed by analysis of the results. The prediction of progeny values is carried out by statistical methods using three statistical tests, as well as with the use of a mixed biometric model. It is of interest to compare estimates obtained by using statistical methods with estimates using a mixed biometric model. Material and Methods. The initial data set was the live weight of Qigai rams, the progeny of a group of sixteen rams belonging to eight genetic groups. Results. It was found that the forecast of breeding values of each animal using a mixed biometric model substantially clarifies the rank of each animal in the group being evaluated. Conclusion. The refinement of the estimation of breeding value is related to the effects of the genetic groups to which the animals belong in the mixed model, as well as the degree of relationship between them. Also the mixed model also allows one to isolate environmental effects from the overall assessment.

It had 12 focus group discussions with 123 participants, semi-structured interviews with 255 farmers, and in-depth interviews with 5 purposively selected households. Results indicate that only 30% of the smallholder farmer households were resilient to the effects of abnormal rainfall seasons. Five strategies including use of physical and financial reserves, agronomic practices, alteration of livelihood asset portfolio, diversification into off-farm ventures, and uptake of soil fertility and water conservation were associated with households that were resilient to effects of abnormal rainfall seasons. The use of these strategies was enhanced by livestock ownership, group membership, access to land, amount of regular financial savings, and use of climatic forecast information. Overall, these findings suggest that building smallholder farmers' resilience to rainfall variability requires a multipronged approach to improve farmers' agricultural production as well as expanding their asset base and off-farm livelihood options.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,2,,,,1610-2010,,978-3-030-12974-3; 978-3-030-12973-6,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2019,,,,,,,509,539,,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3_23,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3,,,Agricultural Engineering; Area Studies; Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,WOS:000489289500025,,,,,

This chapter highlights the need to utilize ICT tools to improve livelihoods of farmers in Uganda, in the face of climate change and variations in seasonal weather. We investigated the use of ICT tools and services in enhancing farmers' access to weather forecast information to improve agricultural productivity in Uganda. The ICT tools in question included mobile phones and computers/laptops, while the services included the use of emails, websites, and social network sites. We used focus group sessions with farmers in Mbale and Rakai districts to (1) capture their perception of the use of ICT tools and (2) establish the mode of ICT-supported dissemination that would be most effective and efficient for relevant weather forecast information dissemination. Extra information was sourced from key informant interviews with agricultural extension workers and personnel from Uganda National Meteorological Authority. We transcribed the information gathered into descriptive narratives, used thematic analysis and coding with spreadsheets for analysis. We found the mobile phone to be the ICT tool that most farmers have access to, and we found them open to solutions designed around the mobile phone. We establish and recommend using ICT tools to complement existing and conventional weather information dissemination strategies such as mass media. ICT tools allow for customized information to be sent to farmers in text, graphic, audio, or visual formats. We also found that ICT tools enhance user control and interaction, allow farmers to query and receive specific responses of weather forecast information they are interested in, provide a mechanism to collect crowdsourced feedback that can be used to improve the weather information services and products provided by UNMA, and promote timely and easy access to weather information. We noted that if fully exploited, ICT tools have the potential to contribute to effective dissemination of tailored weather information, which would help to improve the livelihoods of the farmers in Uganda.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,1610-2010,,978-3-030-12974-3; 978-3-030-12973-6,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2019,,,,,,,571,593,,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3_25,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3,,,Agricultural Engineering; Area Studies; Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,WOS:000489289500027,,,,,

In many smallholder farming communities, the reliability and accuracy of the scientific information is questionable and therefore not adequately used to make informed farming decisions. Amidst this dilemma, smallholder farmers rely heavily on indigenous knowledge to comprehend rainfall patterns in their day-to-day and seasonal farming calendar. A study carried out among smallholder farmers in the Mt. Elgon region indicated that a large proportion of farmers used a wide range of indigenous indicators to predict rainfall patterns. The indicators used by farmers were largely celestial objects and/or animal/plant behaviour to forecast onset and cessation of rains.

The plateau is vulnerable to climate change which threatens grassland resources, watersheds, livestock and pastoral population. As the pastoralists are the key custodians of the plateau, this study examined their climate change perceptions and analyzed their adaptation strategies in Tibetan Plateau, China. The results showed that majority of the pastoralists were aware of the climate change issues in the plateau. It was found that pastoralists have noticed changes in climate variability leading to grassland degradation and poor animal health and productivity. TV Programs about climate change and weather forecast programs were among the key tools for developing pastoral perception about climate change. The demographic characteristic of the pastorals like education, age and household size proved to contribute in the development of climate change perceptions among pastorals (P <= 0.05). The study found that livelihood diversification, having mixed livestock breeds, cultivation of high yielding and drought tolerant forage varieties, grassland fencing and controlled grazing were among the most practiced adaptation strategies in the Plateau.

Conventional multi-category runoff prediction usually utilizes manually specified threshold values to categorize runoff categories. However, this approach is arguably subjective, and it neglects fuzziness and peculiarity of hydrometeorological time series. To address this issue, a new concept, forecast domain, is proposed in this study. Cluster analysis of runoff time series was carried out with the Gaussian Mixture Model, and Support Vector Classification was then used to establish the nonlinear relationships between forecast domain and various potential predictors. The current study focuses on the Danjiangkou Reservoir, the source of the Central Route of the South-North Water Transfer Project in China We use the 25-year data (1981-2005) for model training, and the Danjiangkou runoff data during last 11 years (2006-2016) are used for model validation.

In this study we developed a bio-economic model of forecast use, explicitly incorporating forecast uncertainty. Using agricultural systems (ag-systems) production simulation software calibrated with case study information, we simulated pasture growth, herd dynamics and annual economic returns under different climatic conditions. We then employed a regret and value function approach to quantify the potential economic value of using SCFs (at both current and improved accuracy levels) in decision making for a grazing enterprise in north-eastern Queensland, Australia - a region subject to significant seasonal and intra-decadal climate variability. Applying an expected utility economic modelling approach, we show that skilled SCF systems can contribute considerable value to farm level decision making. At the current SCF skill of 62% (derived by correlating the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal and historical climate data) at Charters Towers, an average annual forecast value of AU$4420 (4.25%) was realised for the case study average annual net profit of AU$104000, while a perfect (no regret) forecast system could result in an increased return of AU$13475 per annum (13% of the case study average annual net profit). Continued improvements in the skill and reliability of SCFs is likely to both increase the value of SCFs to agriculture and drive wider uptake of climate forecasts in on-farm decision making. We also anticipate that an integrated framework, such as that developed in this study, may provide a pathway for better communication with end users to support improved understanding and use of forecasts in agricultural decision making and enhanced sustainability of agricultural enterprises.",,,,,"Reardon-Smith, Kathryn/0000-0002-0997-3058",Queensland Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP); University of Southern Queensland's Strategic Research Initiative,"This research is funded through the Queensland Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP) and University of Southern Queensland's Strategic Research Initiative.

Though self-sufficiency has been achieved, it was accompanied by negative environmental effects such as serious non-target agricultural pollution. Implementation of eco-friendly smart agricultural practices can effectively overcome such pollution. However, the major constraints in assent and adoption of these practices are not limited only to associate risks and potential benefits, but farmers' attitudes towards knowledge of scientifically validated practices too came into picture. In the presented study, opinions of 180 respondents were explored in personal interviews using a three-point continuum scale for the major constraints (very serious, serious and not so serious) and scores were given as 3, 2 and 1, respectively. Weighted mean score (WMS), rank orders, standard deviation, correlation and regression were computed for the better understanding. Results concluded that major constraints for smart agricultural practices in their assent were non-familiarization with improved practices (WMS = 2.46), procedure of registration for weather forecasting (2.37), conservation agriculture is more labour intensive (2.24), lack of training to access e-information (2.39), Climate change effects the seasonal temperature and rainfall (2.76), Slow result of eco- friendly practices (2.54), high initial cost of protected structure (2.52), and lack of proper training for agro-processing and value addition practices (2.42). The results also indicated that 11 independent variables which were included in the study jointly contributed 37.00% variations in the constraints faced by the farmers in adoption of smart agricultural practices.",,,,"Kumar, Parveen/AAK-3069-2020","Kumar, Parveen/0000-0002-4490-4314",,,,,0,0,0,5,,,,1589-1623,1785-0037,,APPL ECOL ENV RES,Appl.

Soil samples were collected two times per year, in spring and autumn, over the period 2010-2012 from fixed locations scattered across whole Poland territory. Additionally, particle-size distribution was assessed in the tested soil samples, which allowed to assign soil agronomic categories to them and assess the relationship between N-min content and assigned categories. Regardless of sampling date and land use, agronomic category had a significant effect on N-min content. Generally the relationships between the percentage of particles with dimensions below 0.02 mm and N-min content were characterized by a negative correlations, but in maize crops they were found to be positively correlated. Based on the obtained correlations, linear regression equations were developed. Calculated relations were less pronounced in spring, before fertilization, than in the autumn, after harvest. These equations can be very important from the practical point of view, as they may be used by farmer to plan a rational and sustainable fertilization based on forecasting of losses of mineral nitrogen content in the soil depending on the percentage of fine particles (agronomic category) of cultivated soil.",,,,"Krzyszczak, Jaromir/L-3894-2019; TKACZYK, PRZEMYSLAW/U-5957-2018","Krzyszczak, Jaromir/0000-0002-9235-8119; TKACZYK, PRZEMYSLAW/0000-0001-7734-1872",Polish National Centre for Research and Development [BIOSTRATEG3/347464/5/NCBR/2017],"This paper has been partly financed from the funds of the Polish National Centre for Research and Development in frame of the project BIO-FERTIL, contract number: BIOSTRATEG3/347464/5/NCBR/2017.",,,0,0,0,1,,,,1589-1623,1785-0037,,APPL ECOL ENV RES,Appl.

Relatively few studies on the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetland plant biomass have been conducted because of the difficulties in obtaining detailed and accurate data. Carex cinerascens meadows are important patches in Poyang Lake in eastern China and provide significant food resources and habitats for wintering waterbirds, particularly geese. We proposed a method to estimate the biomass of C. cinerascens in a subsection of Poyang Lake, i.e. Baisha Lake, employing the digital elevation model and water level gradient of the lake combined with the logistic regression model based on data from field measurements in different elevations. We obtained four C. cinerascens biomass estimation models based on four elevations divided. The maximum biomass decreased with decreasing elevation. Meanwhile, the maximum growth rate initially increased and subsequently decreased. The biomass of C. cinerascens per unit area ranged from 0.10 to 0.58 kg/m(2) in the autumn and winter. Significant differences in the growth process of C. cinerascens were observed in different water level gradients. The total biomass of C. cinerascens in Baisha Lake changed following an S-shaped curve and reached 221, 503, and 615 t in the middle of October, November, and December, respectively. The research results can be used to forecast the biomass of C. cinerascens under different hydrological conditions in Poyang Lake, and to provide wetland plant biomass estimation methods for other similar regions.",,,,"Zhao, Liang/T-9147-2019",,Research and Development of Composite Model in Poyang Lake Water Ecology; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41471088],The research was financially supported by the Research and Development of Composite Model in Poyang Lake Water Ecology.

Predictions based on species distribution models forecast that most bee species will continue to decline as climate change progresses, the few exceptions to this being common, widespread species with large dispersal capabilities. Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how pollinator species are likely to respond. Here we present species distribution models for the arid-adapted Australian small carpenter bee, Ceratina australensis Perkins, 1912 (Apidae: Xylocopinae) under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change conditions predicted for 2070 (Representative Carbon Pathway 8.5). We applied Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and Random Forest methods. Overall, our models predict that this bee will have an increased area of suitable habitat as climate change progresses, including an increased range within protected areas. However, its potential range will shift further into coastal areas, that are highly human populated and urbanised. Our results suggest that wild bee taxa may be able to cope with the predicted scale of future aridification under climate change. Finally, this species is predicted to increase in urban environments, which highlights the need for city planning, suitable habitats and green spaces to support wild bee species.

Strategic conservation planning, and more recently marine spatial planning (MSP) are among the most promising management tools to operationalize and enforce marine conservation. As yet, climate change is seldom incorporated into these plans, potentially curtailing the effectiveness of designated conservation areas under novel environmental conditions. Reliable assessment of current and future climate change threats requires the ability to map climate-driven eco-evolutionary changes and the identification of vulnerable and resistant populations. Here we explore the heretofore largely unrecognized value of information gained from physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies to MSP under ongoing climate change. For example, we explore how climate threats do not necessarily follow latitudinal gradients, such that both risk hotspots and refugia occur in mosaic distributions along species ranges - patterns that may be undetectable without knowledge of biological vulnerabilities at regional and local scales. Because co-occurring species can exhibit markedly different vulnerabilities to the same environmental changes, making ecological predictions requires, when possible, measuring the fundamental niches of key species (e.g., with the use of thermotolerance experiments). Forecasting also requires development of tools to identify the likelihood of community-level thresholds or tipping points (e.g., with the use of near-real world mesocosms), and assessment of the potential of populations for adaptation (e.g., with common garden experiments). Such research will facilitate better predictive models for the fate of populations, species, ecosystems and their functions. Ultimately, unfolding the complexity of the processes underlying climate change impacts will facilitate quantifying and reducing uncertainty in spatial planning decision processes and will enable the development of practical tools to validate adaptive conservation strategies.

The matched fishery and environmental data (sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, and ocean net primary productivity data) were collected from 2010 to 2014 in the open SCS. We calculated catch per unit effort (CPUE) and fishing effort to estimate the suitability index. The estimated suitable ranges for sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, and net primary productivity were 27.1-30.4 degrees C, 0-0.15 cm, and 236.2-492.8 mg C/m(2) d based on the HSI model incorporating fishing effort.

Important innovations have been developed in recent years for detection of both invasive and native crayfish, mainly through eDNA, which allows for the detection of the target species even at low abundance levels and when not directly observable. Forecasting models have also moved towards the creation of realistic invasion scenarios, allowing effective management plans to be developed in advance of invasions. The importance of monitoring the spread and impacts of crayfish and pathogens in developing national data and research networks is emphasised; here citizen science can also play a role.

Reliable predictions of population spread rates are essential to forecast biological invasions. Recent studies have shown that populations spreading through favourable habitat can rapidly evolve higher dispersal and reproductive rates at the expansion front, which accelerates spread velocity. However, spreading populations are likely to eventually encounter stressful conditions in the expanded range. How evolution during spread in favourable environments affects subsequent population growth in harsher environments is currently unknown. 2. We examined evolutionary change in performance under drought, interspecific competition, and heat stress for populations of Arabidopsis thaliana that experienced six generations of spread through replicated experimental landscapes of favourable habitat. To quantify how population performance under stress differed between leading edge and founding populations, we combined individual tests of genotype performance under stress with knowledge of the genotype frequency changes that occurred over the replicate invasions. 3. After spreading through favourable environments, the average silique production of individuals exposed to drought or interspecific competition was lower in leading edge than founding populations. This change was driven by the evolution of lower intrinsic silique production, which was correlated with increased seed size, a trait that evolved as populations spread. The ability of plants to tolerate drought or interspecific competition, however, did not change markedly during spread. Heat tolerance did increase in leading edge populations, and this trait was associated with the evolution of taller plants during spread through favourable habitat. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that evolution during spread in favourable environments may affect the ability of populations to grow under stressful conditions as experienced in the expanded range, through changes in either intrinsic fecundity or stress tolerance. Thus, evolution during spread may constrain or extend the eventual range limit of nonnative species invasions.",,,,"Lustenhouwer, Nicky/I-6981-2019; Williams, Jennifer L/H-1717-2011; Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Williams, Jennifer L/0000-0002-4497-4961; Lustenhouwer, Nicky/0000-0002-5157-857X",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A_141025],"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_141025",,,3,3,0,8,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Among these activities, agriculture represents a land use that is crucial for human development but also a key driver of stream degradation and biodiversity decline in the tropics. Against this background, we investigated indirect effects of agriculture (alterations in stream flow and nutrient availability) and climate characteristics (water temperature) on benthic biofilm communities in tropical streams (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Three first-order streams draining catchments dominated by agricultural land use (sugarcane for bioenergy production, pasture) with some remaining riparian forest were studied for 1 year. We focused on the relationships of benthic biofilm biomass, algal biomass, diatom community, and functional structure with streamflow dynamics, nitrate concentrations, and water temperature. Our results indicate that these biological responses were mainly mediated by flow and water temperature and not by resource availability in the studied headwater streams. This result could be explained by the heavy rains and elevated runoff generation in these tropical catchments under agricultural influence, which might override the known effects of nutrient enrichment on benthic biofilm communities. Considering forecast climate and land-use changes in tropical streams, our findings may suggest potential shifts in benthic biofilm communities, with functional consequences for aquatic food webs in these environments.",,,,"Taniwaki, Ricardo Hideo/D-9577-2012; Ferraz, Silvio FB/C-8851-2012; Piggott, Jeremy/K-6157-2017","Taniwaki, Ricardo Hideo/0000-0002-2186-8998; Ferraz, Silvio FB/0000-0003-1808-5420; Piggott, Jeremy/0000-0002-1515-1878","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [12/03527-7, 14/11401-9]","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, Grant/Award Number: 12/03527-7 and 14/11401-9",,,2,2,2,13,,,,0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JAN,2019,51,1,,,,,18,27,,10.1111/btp.12617,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000457405800003,,,,,

Ideally, researchers would like to forecast the necessary power when planning their project. neogen (genetic N-e for Overlapping Generations) enables estimates of precision and accuracy in advance of empirical investigation and allows exploration of the power available in different user-specified age-structured sampling schemes. neogen provides a population simulation and genetic power analysis framework that simulates the demographics, genetic composition, and N-e, from species-specific life history, mortality, population size, and genetic priors. neogen guides the user to establish a tractable sampling regime and to determine the numbers of samples and microsatellite or SNP loci required for accurate and precise genetic N-e estimates when sampling a natural population. neogen is useful at multiple stages of a study's life cycle: when budgeting, as sampling and locus development progresses, and for corroboration when empirical N-e estimates are available. The underlying model is applicable to a wide variety of iteroparous species with overlapping generations (e.g., mammals, birds, reptiles, long-lived fishes).

We demonstrate the use of neogen with empirical Australian east coast zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum) data. For researchers wishing to make accurate and precise genetic N-e estimates for overlapping generations species, neogen facilitates planning for sample and locus acquisition, and with existing empirical genetic N-e estimates neogen can corroborate population demographic and life history properties.",,,,"Ovenden, Jennifer/A-3717-2010; Riginos, Cynthia/G-3320-2010","Ovenden, Jennifer/0000-0001-7538-1504; Riginos, Cynthia/0000-0002-5485-4197",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation [2010/062],"Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grant/Award Number: 2010/062",,,1,1,2,8,,,,1755-098X,1755-0998,,MOL ECOL RESOUR,Mol.

The framework exploits data from the suite of models of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), fed to an artificial neural network for the removal of bias. The method inherently considers spatial and temporal correlations, because it is applied simultaneously to all monitoring stations of a given region, using past observations and past and future forecasts. The methodology is tested on twelve months of CAMS forecasts of daily surface particulate matter (PM10) in 2017 and is verified against observations measured at 413 monitoring stations from the Italian air quality network. The raw data from the CAMS system, although they contain valuable information, show very poor performance, due to a large negative bias that does not allow the correct prediction of critical conditions. The model bias is found to have a strong seasonal dependency, with a large positive bias in winter and a small negative bias during summer months. The correction applied through the neural model allows to correct the original predictions and to practically eliminate the bias, increasing the performance forecast even to four days ahead. It is concluded that neural networks can be used to develop reliable air quality early-warning systems based on a network of automated monitoring stations and real-time ensemble predictions from deterministic models.",,,,"Staiano, Antonino/B-6781-2013; Riccio, Angelo/F-7795-2012","Staiano, Antonino/0000-0002-4708-5860; Riccio, Angelo/0000-0001-7775-5565; Camastra, Francesco/0000-0003-4439-7583; Ciaramella, Angelo/0000-0001-5592-7995",,,,,1,1,1,8,,,,1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

Using standardized survey data along the northeast US continental shelf, we assessed the historical exposure and sensitivity of 81 species of marine chordates, arthropods, and molluscs to 24 sea surface temperature (SST) variables in two seasons. By comparing temperature trends in geographies available to species against temperature trends in geographies used by them we were able to identify which variables species track consistently through space and time. Logistic regression analyses were then used to assess whether species traits affected the likelihood of niche tracking while accounting for the season and temporal window in which temperatures were summarized and methodological constraints that might have limited our ability to detect tracking responses. A slight majority of species (52%) clearly shifted their distributions to track at least one temperature variable through space and time. Tracking rates were much lower on a per variable basis (5.1% of 3432 variables), despite widespread exposure to changing temperatures (89.2% of 3432 variables). None of the twelve ecological traits we investigated - including traits related to dispersal ability, ecological specialization, reproductive capacity, and commercial harvest - accounted for differences in tracking responses across species even after accounting for differences in climate exposure. Our results suggest widespread behavioral or physiological flexibility among our study species, or ongoing genetic adaptation to changing temperatures.

Although reintroductions can have striking and positive outcomes, they also carry risks; many well-intentioned conservation actions have had surprising and unsatisfactory outcomes. A range of network-based mathematical methods has been developed to make quantitative predictions of how communities will respond to management interventions. These methods are based on the limited knowledge of which species interact with each other and in what way. However, expert knowledge isn't perfect and can only take models so far. Fortunately, other types of data, such as abundance time series, is often available, but, to date, no quantitative method exists to integrate these various data types into these models, allowing more precise ecosystem-wide predictions. In this paper, we develop mathematical methods that combine time-series data of multiple species with knowledge of species interactions and we apply it to proposed reintroductions at Booderee National Park in Australia. There have been large fluctuations in species abundances at Booderee National Park in recent history, following intense feral fox (Vulpes vulpes) control, including the local extinction of the greater glider (Petauroides volans). These fluctuations can provide information about the system isn't readily obtained from a stable system, and we use them to inform models that we then use to predict potential outcomes of eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) and long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) reintroductions. One of the key species of conservation concern in the park is the Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus), and we find that long-nosed potoroo introduction would have very little impact on the Eastern Bristlebird population, while the eastern quoll introduction increased the likelihood of Eastern Bristlebird decline, although that depends on the strength and form of any possible interaction.",,,,"Bode, Michael/P-1333-2019; Lindenmayer, David B./P-7183-2017","Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Plein, Michaela/0000-0002-7912-2486; Lindenmayer, David B./0000-0002-4766-4088; Baker, Christopher/0000-0001-9449-3632","ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, The National Environmental Research Project Decisions Hub; Science and Industry Endowment Fund; ARC Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT170100274, FT170100140]; ARC DECRA FellowshipAustralian Research Council; ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [LP160100496]","We thank Booderee National Park for facilitating this work and the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community for allowing work on the land, and Yi Han, Zoe Knapp, and Sean Maxwell for their contribution at the initial workshop.

Micromonas comprises at least four different species often found in sympatry. While such ubiquity might suggest a wide thermal niche, the temperature response of the different strains is still unexplored, leaving many questions as for their ecological success over such diverse ecosystems. Using combined experiments and theory, we characterize the thermal response of eleven Micromonas strains belonging to four species. We demonstrate that the variety of specific responses to temperature in the Micromonas genus makes this environmental factor an ideal marker to describe its global distribution and diversity. We then propose a diversity model for the genus Micromonas, which proves to be representative of the whole phytoplankton diversity. This prominent primary producer is therefore a sentinel organism of phytoplankton diversity at the global scale. We use the diversity within Micromonas to anticipate the potential impact of global warming on oceanic phytoplankton. We develop a dynamic, adaptive model and run forecast simulations, exploring a range of adaptation time scales, to probe the likely responses to climate change.

Our paper is, therefore, intended to strengthen the related evidence base. We present recent projections from the dynamic Multi-Region Input-Output (MRIO) simulation model GINFORS (Global Inter-Industry Forecasting System), which provide an outlook on global development trends until the year 2050. Our detailed material footprint and climate policy assessment indicates that a global agreement on a policy mix will allow a clear turnaround towards climate protection and a sustainable use of natural resources without deteriorating economic performance. If the EU decides unilaterally to lead the way, then this turnaround could also be achieved for the EU while the EU would also benefit economically from this pioneering role.

Tree growth is known to respond to global-change drivers such as climate change or atmospheric deposition, as well as to local land-use drivers such as forest management. Yet, large geographical scale studies examining interactive growth responses to multiple global-change drivers are relatively scarce and rarely consider management effects. Here, we assessed the interactive effects of three global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation and nitrogen deposition) on individual tree growth of three study species (Quercus robur/petraea, Fagus sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior). We sampled trees along spatial environmental gradients across Europe and accounted for the effects of management for Quercus. We collected increment cores from 267 trees distributed over 151 plots in 19 forest regions and characterized their neighbouring environment to take into account potentially confounding factors such as tree size, competition, soil conditions and elevation. We demonstrate that growth responds interactively to global-change drivers, with species-specific sensitivities to the combined factors. Simultaneously high levels of precipitation and deposition benefited Fraxinus, but negatively affected Quercus' growth, highlighting species-specific interactive tree growth responses to combined drivers. For Fagus, a stronger growth response to higher temperatures was found when precipitation was also higher, illustrating the potential negative effects of drought stress under warming for this species. Furthermore, we show that past forest management can modulate the effects of changing temperatures on Quercus' growth; individuals in plots with a coppicing history showed stronger growth responses to higher temperatures. Overall, our findings highlight how tree growth can be interactively determined by global-change drivers, and how these growth responses might be modulated by past forest management. By showing future growth changes for scenarios of environmental change, we stress the importance of considering multiple drivers, including past management and their interactions, when predicting tree growth.",,,,"Brumelis, Guntis/A-5304-2008; Hedl, Radim/A-5631-2011; Malis, Frantisek/AAD-5364-2019; Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/AAC-8184-2020; Kopecky, Martin/A-1466-2009; Perring, Michael/B-1323-2011","Malis, Frantisek/0000-0003-2760-6988; Kopecky, Martin/0000-0002-1018-9316; Brunet, Jorg/0000-0003-2667-4575; den Ouden, Jan/0000-0003-1518-2460; Perring, Michael/0000-0001-8553-4893; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/0000-0002-2042-8245","European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [614839]; VEGAVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [1/0639/17, APVV-14-0086]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-09283S]; Czech Academy of ScienceCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]","European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 614839; VEGA, Grant/Award Number: 1/0639/17, APVV-14-0086; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic, Grant/Award Number: 17-09283S; The Czech Academy of Science, Grant/Award Number: RVO 67985939",,,7,7,7,63,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Understanding this process, including its speed and intensity, is paramount due to the pace at which such changes are currently occurring. Tree species are particularly interesting to study in this regard due to their long generation times, sedentarism, and ecological and economic importance. Quercus suber L. is an evergreen forest tree species of the Fagaceae family with an essentially Western Mediterranean distribution. Despite frequent assessments of the species' evolutionary history, large-scale genetic studies have mostly relied on plastidial markers, whereas nuclear markers have been used on studies with locally focused sampling strategies. In this work, ""Genotyping by sequencing"" is used to derive 1,996 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to assess the species' evolutionary history from a nuclear DNA perspective, gain insights into how local adaptation is shaping the species' genetic background, and to forecast how Q. suber may respond to global climatic changes from a genetic perspective. Results reveal (a) an essentially unstructured species, where (b) a balance between gene flow and local adaptation keeps the species' gene pool somewhat homogeneous across its distribution, but still allowing (c) variation clines for the individuals to cope with local conditions. ""Risk of Non-Adaptedness"" (RONA) analyses suggest that for the considered variables and most sampled locations, (d) the cork oak should not require large shifts in allele frequencies to survive the predicted climatic changes.

To test the hypothesis, we adopted the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model, incorporating the latest urban modeling system, for regional climate simulations. Projected future urban growth in the period 2010-2100 was obtained from Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The simulations of urban growth in CRB demonstrated significant nocturnal warming of about 0.36 degrees C, 1.07 degrees C, and 0.94 degrees C in near-surface temperatures in Phoenix, Denver, and Las Vegas respectively, with comparatively insignificant changes in daytime temperature. In addition, it was found that the thermal environment of Denver is the most susceptible to the projected future urban growth.

Accurate recordings and predictions of how the temperatures of plants and animals vary in time and space are therefore critical to forecasting the likely impacts of global climate change. Intertidal zones have long served as a model ecosystem for examining the role of environmental stress on patterns of species distributions, and are emerging as models for understanding the ecological impacts of climate change. Intertidal environments are among the most physically demanding habitats on the planet, and excursions in body temperature of ectotherms can exceed 25 degrees C over the course of a few hours. It is now well-known that the body temperatures of intertidal organisms can deviate significantly from the temperature of the surrounding air and substrate due to the influence of solar radiation, and that their size, color, morphology, and material properties markedly influence their temperatures. While many intertidal organisms are slow moving or almost entirely sessile, for others, behavior can play a significant role in driving vulnerability to temperature extremes. We explore datalogging methods used in intertidal zones and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each. We show how measurements made in situ reveal patterns of thermal stress that otherwise would be undetectable using more remotely-sensed data. Additionally, we explore the idea that the relevant ""grain size"" of the physical environment, and thus the spatial scale that must be measured, is a function of (1) the size of the organism relative to local refugia; (2) an organism's ability to sense and to some degree predict near-term environmental conditions; and (3) an animal's movement speed and directionality toward refugia. Similarly, relevant temporal scales depend on the size, behavior, and physiological response of the organism. While miniaturization of dataloggers has significantly improved, several significant limitations still exist, many of which relate to difficulties in recording behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions. We discuss recent innovations in monitoring and modeling intertidal temperatures, and the important role that they have played in bridging ecological and physiological studies of ongoing impacts of climate change.",,,,"Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019","Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414; Choi, Francis/0000-0003-4389-8087",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 1635989],This research was supported by NSF grant OCE 1635989 to BH.

This paper focuses on the latter strategy. Most of those predatory mite species are generalist predators; they are naturally present in agro-ecosystems both on crops and adjacent natural vegetation. Because of such characteristics, their occurrence is usually associated with the use of fewer pesticides, providing relief to ecosystem services. As a first baseline for managing their occurrence in agro-ecosystems, a review of the present knowledge of plants and predatory mite interactions and predator dispersal ability is proposed. In addition, based on the author's own occurrence database, the study aims at analyzing (i) plant traits and the potential co-evolutionary relationships between plants and predatory mite species and (ii) how this can be used to forecast favorable plants to key predatory mites. For this, some examples were taken, i.e., vine and citrus crops, and three species, Kampimodromus aberrans, Euseius stipulates, and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri. The main conclusion is that the occurrence database can help in determining the probability of finding predatory mite species on crops and non-crop plants. However, because some elements are lacking, especially predatory mite density, plant traits and the true overall distribution, it is currently, difficult to associate plant traits and plant phylogeny to Phytoseiidae diversity. Additional meta-analyses in collaboration with plant specialists would be required. Finally, the paper presents some examples of agroecosystem management at different scales (intercropping, agroforestry, borders management, landscape).",,,,,,,,,,5,5,1,9,,,,2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Al-though numerous correlations between environmental variables such as food abundance or sea surface temperature have been proposed in the past, few are operational in a fisheries management context today. Reasons for this may include many-but spurious-correlations, the use of higher-level climate-change indicators, and misconceived perception of causal relationships. In the present study, we demonstrate how modelled oceanographic data describing local conditions, combined with a simple probabilistic risk assessment, can be used to forecast fish recruitment. We used the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus in the North Sea as an example, and focussed on the circulation patterns experienced by the first-feeding larvae on the Dogger Bank. A strong link between the net direction of water transport at the surface and unusually strong year-classes of sandeel was found. For example, the most extreme recruitments only took place in years with a particular type of flow regime in February, which may be associated with the occasional reversals of the North Sea circulation. Using risk ratios, we show the potential for using flow regime in probabilistic short-term forecasts of unusually strong year-classes. Lastly, we propose a hypothesis for recruitment in sandeel which could be extended to other species, and thereby contribute to future studies of predictors in recruitment forecasting.",,,,"Henriksen, Ole/X-1941-2019","Henriksen, Ole/0000-0002-0486-8451",COFASP ERA-NET partners; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [321553]; national funding agency of Denmark; European Fisheries Foundation [33113-B-16-080],"The contributions by M.v.D., S.J., and B.R.M. in this investigation were supported in part by the COFASP ERA-NET partners, which has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Program for research, technological development, and demonstration under grant agreement no. 321553 (GOFORIT project), and by the national funding agency of Denmark.

However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e. local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.",,,,"Fronhofer, Emanuel A./J-9784-2013; Harvey, Eric/L-7029-2019","Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Harvey, Eric/0000-0002-8601-7326; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958; Gounand, Isabelle/0000-0002-0675-3973","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PP00P3_150698, PP00P3_179089]; University of Zurich; Eawag","Funding is from the Swiss National Science Foundation grant no.

In addition, the success of colonization and the risk of extinction are expected to be influenced by the proximity to habitat boundary. We address here the influence of boundary vicinity for a contact-process model of population dynamics in a percolating habitat lattice. To separate the influence of boundary vicinity from that of fragment area, we investigate population dynamics in the very large spanning cluster of the percolating habitat. The geometry of the spanning cluster varies when habitat density in the lattice is tuned away from the percolation threshold. We expect that the colonization success decreases closer to the boundary, leading to depleted site occupancy in the cluster, and that this effect is even more pronounced near the extinction threshold of the contact process. For the set of suitable sites of the cluster and unsuitable sites next to its boundary, we quantify the boundary density, sigma, as the probability to draw a pair of suitable and unsuitable sites. The cluster boundary is most rugged and a is maximal close to the percolation threshold of the habitat. We expect that the global influence of boundary on population dynamics in the cluster is greater when the boundary is more rugged. We thus investigate population dynamics in the spanning cluster for varying values of sigma. We determine the stationary properties of population dynamics in the spanning cluster according to sigma and to the species-specific ratio of extinction and colonization rates, denoted r. Using both numerical simulations and a pair-approximation model, we assess global species persistence and site occupancy patterns in the spanning cluster. We show that the extinction threshold r(c) depends crucially on sigma, i.e., increasing sigma limits global species persistence. Furthermore, increasing sigma decreases the probability of site occupancy in the spanning cluster. A key result is that this influence extends to sites far from the boundary when r gets close to r(c). Therefore, species that are at risk of extinction are more sensitive to the influence of habitat boundary. These results are of both theoretical and practical interest for understanding and forecasting species viability in heterogeneous and fragmented habitats.",,,,,,Scientific Council of the University of Montpellier 2; RNSC (Reseau National des Systemes Complexes); University of Montpellier [CF-RM05]; LabeX NUMEV [AAP2017-1-08]; UC Berkeley's Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF),"GH was funded by a doctoral grant from the Scientific Council of the University of Montpellier 2, and by RNSC (Reseau National des Systemes Complexes).

The influence of spatial information and environmental factors on forecasting error is not often considered. I propose a forecasting method called spatiotemporally explicit model averaging (STEMA) to combine spatial and temporal information through model averaging. I examine the performance of STEMA against two popular forecasting models and a modern spatial prediction model: the autoregressive integrated moving averages with explanatory variables (ARIMAX) model, the Bayesian hierarchical model, and the varying coefficient model. I focus on applying the methods to four species of Alaskan groundfish for which catch data are available. My method reduces forecasting errors significantly for most of the tested models when compared to ARIMAX, Bayesian, and varying coefficient methods. I also consider the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on the forecasting of catch, as multiple studies reveal a potential influence of water temperature on the survival and growth of juvenile groundfish. For most of the preferred models, inclusion of SST in the model improved forecasting of catch. It is advisable to consider both spatial information and relevant environmental factors in forecasting models to obtain more accurate projections of population abundance. The STEMA method is capable of accounting for spatial information in forecasting and can be applied to various types of data because of its flexible varying coefficient model structure. It is therefore a suitable forecasting method for application to many fields including ecology, epidemiology, and climatology.",,,,,"Correia, Hannah/0000-0003-3476-3674",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1414475],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1414475",,,1,1,0,1,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We test whether physiological constraints on maximum metabolic rate and the factor by which endotherms can elevate their metabolism (metabolic expansibility) influence cold range limits for mammal and bird species. We examine metabolic expansibility at the cold range boundary (MECRB) and whether species' traits can predict variability in MECRB and then use MECRB as an initial approach to project range shifts for 210 mammal and 61 bird species. We find evidence for metabolic constraints: the distributions of metabolic expansibility at the cold range boundary peak at similar values for birds (2.7) and mammals (3.2). The right skewed distributions suggest some species have adapted to elevate or evade metabolic constraints. Mammals exhibit greater skew than birds, consistent with their diverse thermoregulatory adaptations and behaviors. Mammal and bird species that are small and occupy low trophic levels exhibit high levels of MECRB. Mammals with high MECRB tend to hibernate or use torpor. Predicted metabolic rates at the cold range boundaries represent large energetic expenditures (>50% of maximum metabolic rates). We project species to shift their cold range boundaries poleward by an average of 3.9 degrees latitude by 2070 if metabolic constraints remain constant. Our analysis suggests that metabolic constraints provide a viable mechanism for initial projections of the cold range boundaries for endotherms. However, errors and approximations in estimating metabolic constraints (e.g., acclimation responses) and evasion of these constraints (e.g., torpor/hibernation, microclimate selection) highlight the need for more detailed, taxa-specific mechanistic models. Even coarse considerations of metabolism will likely lead to improved predictions over exclusively considering thermal tolerance for endotherms.",,,,"Hof, Christian/J-8888-2014","Hof, Christian/0000-0002-7763-1885","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1349865, OIA-1632810]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DBI-1349865 and OIA-1632810",,,5,5,3,16,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Ecological niche models (ENMs) are frequently used to show modern ranges and forecast future range changes. These models, however, assume that a species will exhibit niche conservatism, though this is rarely tested. Here, we examine a woodpecker species with a well-documented recent range expansion to assess the effectiveness of predictive models by comparing the pre- and post-expansion climate/habitat niche using ENMs and multivariate principal components analysis. Occurrence data for the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) were obtained from the pre-expansion (1910-1939; n = 299) and post-expansion (1980-2009; n = 868) time periods. Ecological niche models were constructed using GIS layers describing climate data and crop cover for the pre- and post-expansion time periods. We then used the pre-expansion ENM to forecast the distribution of Red-bellied Woodpeckers into the post-expansion time period, and vice versa, and calculated the niche overlap of the projected distributions and the actual distributions in those time periods to determine whether pre- and post-expansion niches were similar. Predictive ENMs did not closely match the actual distributions in the pre- and post-expansion time periods, respectively, and the pre-expansion and post-expansion niches were significantly different from each other (Schoener's D = 0.745, P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the present-day niche encompasses the past niche and that Red-bellied Woodpeckers today have broader temperature and precipitation tolerances and are found in both more- and less-forested areas than they were in the pre-expansion era. Our analyses reveal that Red-bellied Woodpeckers are not exhibiting climate or habitat niche conservatism, explaining why predictive ENMs for this species could not effectively track their range shift.

Along urban-to-rural transects in three regions of the northeastern United States, we recorded the presence of ragweed in 308 plots with different land uses: agriculture, developed, and forest. We also analyzed the effects of plot-level soil moisture, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and canopy cover on ragweed occurrence. Ragweed varied among land uses, but the effect of land use depended on the level of urbanization. The probability of ragweed occurrence was highest in urban forests, rural developed areas, and agricultural areas. Plot-level abiotic variables were not related to ragweed occurrence. Our results suggest that ragweed distributions are influenced to a greater extent by landscape-scale processes, such as propagule pressure and disturbance, than by macro-environmental effects of urbanization.

Some behaviors will be more robust, or developmentally stable, than others in the face of the environmental novelties of captivity. Here, we investigated developmental stability of foraging behavior by quantifying bamboo feeding behavior in captive-bred and wild-born giant pandas, Ailuropoda melanleuca. As an energy-limited species adapted to a low-nutrition diet, any reductions in feeding efficiency may compromise post-release survival. Using video of 22 captive pandas, we measured several components of the panda's elaborate bamboo feeding behavior repertoire. We found that captive-born and wild-born pandas displayed the same repertoire of feeding behaviors, suggesting developmental stability in these motor patterns, but that they employed them differently with different parts of the bamboo. Captive-born pandas devoted less time and effort to handling and chewing leaves while allocating more effort to the consumption of large culms than did wild-born pandas. Captive-born pandas also handled small culm and stripped small culms to prepare them for consumption less often than did wild-born pandas. All of these behavioral differences indicate that wild-born pandas in captivity behave in a manner more similar to wild pandas, and focus their behavioral effort on more nutritious bamboo. Thus, these aspects of captive-born panda feeding behavior may be compromised, and were not developmentally stable in the captive environment. These behavioral differences are cause for concern and should be the subject of future study to determine whether they forecast compromised fitness in translocations. Evaluating developmental stability and behavioral competence should be a key component of captive-release translocation programs, serving to guide pre-release training and selection of individuals to be released.",,,,"Swaisgood, Ronald R/AAL-3198-2020","Swaisgood, Ronald R/0000-0001-5353-2148; Martin, Meghan/0000-0002-7300-7073",,,,,4,4,9,21,,,,1367-9430,1469-1795,,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

Because the cane toad has taken several decades to colonise northern Australia, due to the large size of the continent and the east-west invasion axis, there is scope for making testable predictions about how toads will invade new areas. The western toad invasion front is far from linear, providing clear evidence for heterogeneity in invasion speed. Aims Several ad hoc hypotheses have been offered to explain this heterogeneity, including the evolution of traits that could facilitate dispersal, and spatial heterogeneity in climate patterns. Here an alternative hypothesis is offered, and a prediction generated for the spatiotemporal pattern of invasion into the Kimberley Region - the next frontier for the invading toads in Australia. Methods Using observations of spatiotemporal patterns of cane toad colonisation in northern Australia over the last 15 years, a conceptual model is offered, based on the orientation of wet season river flows relative to the invasion axis, as well as toad rafting and floating behaviour during the wet season. Key results Our model predicts that toads will invade southern areas before northern areas; an alternative model based on rainfall amounts makes the opposite prediction. The models can now be tested by monitoring the spread of invasion front over the next 5-10 years. Conclusions Our conceptual models present a pleuralistic approach to understanding the spatiotemporal invasion dynamics of toads; such an approach and evaluation of the models could prove useful for managing other invasive species. Implications Although control of cane toads has largely proved ineffective, knowledge of the spatiotemporal pattern of the toad invasion in the Kimberley could: (1) facilitate potential management tools for slowing the spread of toads; (2) inform stakeholders in the local planning for the invasion; (3) provide researchers with a temporal context for quantifying toad impacts on animal communities; and (4) reveal the mechanism(s) causing the heterogeneity in invasion speed.",,,,,"Clulow, Simon/0000-0002-5700-6345",Jane Fenwick foundation,"The manuscript benefitted from discussions with B.

Habitat use often differs between sexes, however few studies on sexually monomorphic species document this difference, resulting in misleading ecological interpretations and non-targeted management actions. The aim of this study was to test for sex-specific differences in the seasonal habitat use of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) off Bunbury, Australia. Systematic, boat-based, photographic identification dolphin surveys (n=587) were conducted across seasons over 6years during 2007-2013. Generalised additive models explored relationships between the presence-absence of dolphins and sex, water depth and benthic habitat type. Results highlighted that: (i) habitat use differed seasonally for males and females, (ii) depth had a strong influence on habitat use, which differed between sexes for summer, winter and spring, and (iii) there were no sex differences in habitat use in autumn, which coincides with the peak breeding season. In summer and autumn dolphins were concentrated in shallow, near-shore waters predominantly over reef and sand, and in winter and spring dolphins had a broader distribution over reef and mud/silt with the use of deeper, offshore waters. This pattern is consistent with the seasonally-dependent dolphin abundance that has been documented for this population. Identification of sex differences in habitat use provides management agencies with insights to implement informed actions for the conservation of this coastal dolphin population which is forecast to decline by 50% in the next two decades.",,,,"Bejder, Lars/D-1772-2017; Sprogis, Kate/N-1212-2017; Kobryn, Halina/E-5051-2012","Bejder, Lars/0000-0001-8138-8606; Sprogis, Kate/0000-0002-9050-3028; Kobryn, Halina/0000-0003-1004-7593; Raudino, Holly/0000-0002-2661-6431",South West Marine Research Program (SWMRP); Bemax Cable Sands; BHP Billiton Worsley Alumina Ltd; Bunbury Dolphin Discovery Centre; Bunbury Port Authority; City of Bunbury; Cristal Global; Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife; Iluka; Millard Marine; Naturaliste Charters; Newmont Boddington Gold; South West Development Commission; WA Plantation Resources; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Murdoch University Research Excellence Scholarship; SWMRP Scholarship,"Thank you to Dr T.

It is especially useful in the conservation of avian scavengers inhabiting regions where livestock move on a regular basis (transhumance). Important management decisions can be taken on the basis of theoretical analyses that need to be regularly checked. In this case study, we consider models of Griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus and bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus populations in a part of Spain with one of the highest densities of scavenging birds, and where traditional fanning practices remain. We applied bioinspired Population Dynamic P System models (PDP) to assess these species' population trends against the distribution, quantity and availability of carrion for food. We show asymmetries in the availability of food resources, which are substantially higher in summer due to transhumant movements. In the study area, a lack of food resources in winter leads to a seasonal reduction in food supplies to levels unable to meet the energetic requirements of the most abundant vulture species, the Griffon vulture. Our results suggest that regardless of active management (e.g. supplementary feeding sites) and the birds' use of other potential food resources not included in the model, Griffon vultures are able to find important alternative food resources in more remote areas. We show the importance of variations at spatio-temporal scales in the objective forecasting of population trends, and in the correct application of management actions. Because of the importance of robust assessments for management applications, we discuss the advantages and limitations of ecological modelling for avian scavengers, highlighting the importance of transhumance processes and transboundary approaches.",,,,"Margalida, Antoni/AAG-5337-2020",,"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RYC-2012-11867]; University of Lleida; MAGRAMA, Government of Navarra [Necropir-EFA 130/09]; MINECO [CGL2015-66966-C2-2-R]","A.

Tools to slow the proliferation of aquatic invasive species are still needed to guide the allocation of limited resources more effectively and efficiently once a species is already established. Here we develop mechanistic models to recreate the invasion history of the rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus in the John Day River (JDR) basin, forecast its future distribution, and evaluate the management efficiency of, and trade-offs among, population control actions. Location Methods John Day River Basin, Oregon. The spread and control of rusty crayfish in the JDR was simulated with a spatially explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) whereby the life history of each crayfish in the population is modelled in response to environmental conditions that vary across space and time. The model was calibrated by comparing modelled rusty crayfish spread throughout the JDR to known occurrences according to three comprehensive surveys. Results Main conclusion Our model accurately reproduced historical rusty crayfish distribution data for 2005, 2010, and 2016 with a specificity and sensitivity of similar to 80%. Leveraging this realistic model of the spread of rusty crayfish, we show that rapid management actions to the initial invasion would have resulted in an opportunity to slow the spread of rusty crayfish. We instead predict that rusty crayfish will reach the mainstem of the Columbia River by 2025, at which our model predicts that the crayfish population will number on the order of 10(8) individuals over more than 1100 km of river throughout the watershed and progress into critical salmon spawning habitat. This study demonstrates that SEIBMs can provide unique insight into the future distribution of aquatic invasive species and concretely support decision-makers in choosing an optimal control strategy.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Messager, Mathis/0000-0002-3051-8068",Society for Freshwater Science; Crustacean Society; School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences; University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington,Society for Freshwater Science; The Crustacean Society; School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences; University of Washington,,,3,3,2,8,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Yet, effective pathogen control strategies are notoriously difficult to identify, in part because quantifying and forecasting pathogen spread and disease dynamics is challenging. Following an outbreak, hosts must cope with the presence of the pathogen, leading to host-pathogen coexistence or extirpation. Despite decades of research, little is known about host-pathogen coexistence post-outbreak when low host abundances and cryptic species make these interactions difficult to study. Using a novel disease-structured N-mixture model, we evaluate empirical support for three host-pathogen coexistence hypotheses (source-sink, eco-evolutionary rescue, and spatial variation in pathogen transmission) in a Neotropical amphibian community decimated by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in 2004. During 2010-2014, we surveyed amphibians in Parque Nacional G. D. Omar Torrijos Herrera, Cocle Province, El Cope, Panama. We found that the primary driver of host-pathogen coexistence was eco-evolutionary rescue, as evidenced by similar amphibian survival and recruitment rates between infected and uninfected hosts. Average apparent monthly survival rates of uninfected and infected hosts were both close to 96%, and the expected number of uninfected and infected hosts recruited (via immigration/reproduction) was less than one host per disease state per 20-m site. The secondary driver of host-pathogen coexistence was spatial variation in pathogen transmission as we found that transmission was highest in areas of low abundance but there was no support for the source-sink hypothesis. Our results indicate that changes in the host community (i.e., through genetic or species composition) can reduce the impacts of emerging infectious disease post-outbreak. Our disease-structured N-mixture model represents a valuable advancement for conservation managers trying to understand underlying host-pathogen interactions and provides new opportunities to study disease dynamics in remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens.",,,,"Longo, Ana V./AAH-1522-2020","Longo, Ana V./0000-0002-5112-1246; Zipkin, Elise/0000-0003-4155-6139; DiRenzo, Graziella/0000-0001-5264-4762",National Science Foundation (DEB)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1120161]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Latin-American Studies office at the University of Maryland,"We thank the National Science Foundation (DEB #1120161 to K.

We develop a PVA model that incorporates autocorrelation into the analysis of local demographic information to produce spatially explicit estimates of demography and viability at relatively fine spatial scales across a large spatial extent. We use a hierarchical, spatial, autoregressive model for capture-recapture data from multiple locations to obtain spatially explicit estimates of adult survival (phi(ad)), juvenile survival (phi(juv)), and juvenile-to-adult transition rates (psi), and a spatial autoregressive model for recruitment data from multiple locations to obtain spatially explicit estimates of recruitment (R). We combine local estimates of demographic rates in stage-structured population models to estimate the rate of population change (lambda), then use estimates of lambda (and its uncertainty) to forecast changes in local abundance and produce spatially explicit estimates of viability (probability of extirpation, P-ex). We apply the model to demographic data for the Sonoran desert tortoise (Gopherus morafkai) collected across its geographic range in Arizona. There was modest spatial variation in lambda<^> (0.94-1.03), which reflected spatial variation in phi<^>ad (0.85-0.95), phi<^>juv (0.70-0.89), and psi<^> (0.07-0.13). Recruitment data were too sparse for spatially explicit estimates; therefore, we used a range-wide estimate (R<^> = 0.32 1-yr-old females per female per year). Spatial patterns in demographic rates were complex, but phi<^>ad, phi<^>juv, and lambda<^> tended to be lower and psi<^> higher in the northwestern portion of the range. Spatial patterns in P-ex varied with local abundance. For local abundances >500, P-ex was near zero (<0.05) across most of the range after 100 yr; as abundances decreased, however, P-ex approached one in the northwestern portion of the range and remained low elsewhere. When local abundances were <50, western and southern populations were vulnerable (P-ex > 0.25). This approach to PVA offers the potential to reveal spatial patterns in demography and viability that can inform conservation and management at multiple spatial scales, provide insight into scale-related investigations in population ecology, and improve basic ecological knowledge of landscape-level phenomena.",,,,,"Zylstra, Erin/0000-0002-2536-0403; Steidl, Robert/0000-0001-7330-5380",U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Arizona Game and Fish Department,This work was funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

However, within an ecosystem, F-s can vary based on site structure and function, which can be affected by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. This becomes particularly important when an ecosystem is faced with disturbances, such as drought or fire. Site-specific compensatory responses to disturbances may therefore alter C mineralization, as well as root respiration. Hence, single location F-s estimates may not be a representative for ecosystems across their distributional ranges. We conducted a 6-year study along an edaphic moisture gradient of longleaf pine ecosystems that were maintained with prescribed fire, using eddy covariance and soil respiration measurements to address how F-s varies with changes in ecosystem structure and function, as well as disturbances. Lower air temperatures (T-air) decreased F-s at all sites, but that response was also affected by productivity and SWC. Productivity significantly altered F-s rates at all sites, especially when we accounted for changes in temperature and SWC. Plant regrowth post-fire temporarily increased F-s (10-40%), whereas drought reduced F-s at all sites. Our results show that site productivity, F-s and the degree to which ecosystems adapt to climate variations and disturbance can be site specific. Hence, model forecasting of carbon dynamics would strongly benefit from multi-location measurements of F-s across the distributional range of an ecosystem.",,,,,,Joseph W.

An approach adopting functional responses (FR) and the Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric may offer considerable insight and predictive power regarding invader impacts, which may include losses in ecosystem function and biodiversity. We aim to evaluate the use of FRs and the RIP metric in predicting impact in non-native, data-deficient bivalves. Very little is known about the potential impacts of the Gulf wedge clam, Rangia cuneata outside of its native range, and as a rapidly spreading non-native species, it is highly suitable for this study. Comparisons of feeding activity and abundance between non-native species and functionally analogous native species may produce reliable impact predictions where significant disparity in these factors exists. We conducted field abundance surveys and laboratory feeding studies on R. cuneata, in order to quantify FRs and the RIP metric. Clearance rates and FRs were calculated for R. cuneata and the sympatric, native unionid duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, across a range of algal concentrations at 1.0 ppt salinity. Mean +/- SE clearance rates (ml g DW-1 hr(-1)) were found to be significantly greater for R. cuneata (294.31 +/- 65.17) than for A. anatina (125.99 +/- 29.59) with both species exhibiting a type I functional response. As a result of far greater field abundance of R. cuneata compared with A. anatina (37.7 m(-2) +/- 6.1 versus 0.7 m(-2) +/- 0.4 at sympatric sites) and a significantly higher feeding rate, the RIP score for R. cuneata was high (11.61) signifying likely ecological impact. Calculating the probability density function for the RIP includes uncertainty in the metric and also yielded a very high value (38.14), and these results provide the first evidence that R. cuneata should be considered a high-risk invasive species. The results of our analyses firmly support the assertion that R. cuneata will likely continue to have significant impact in its introduced range if management action is not taken. The rate of spread of R. cuneata, its established densities and RIP score are all comparable to severely invasive bivalves; therefore, R. cuneata may pose a significant threat to both freshwater and brackish water biodiversity and function. We conclude that FRs and the RIP metric may be extremely beneficial to making reliable impact predictions for non-native species and are particularly well suited for estimating the potential impacts of data-deficient novel and emerging non-natives.",,,,,,,,,,6,6,3,20,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Process-based Earth system models (ESMs) attribute enhanced vegetation productivity (greening) to CO2 fertilisation. However, the models poorly reproduce observed spatial patterns of greening, suggesting that they ignore crucial processes. Here, we explore whether fine-scale land cover dynamics, as modified by ecological and land-use processes, can explain the discrepancy between models and satellite-based estimates of greening. We used 500 m satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) to quantify greening. We focus on semi-natural vegetation in Europe, and distinguish between conservation areas and unprotected land. Within these ecological and land-use categories, we then explored the relationships between vegetation change and major climatic gradients. Despite the relatively short time-series (15 years), we found a strong overall increase in LAI (i.e., greening) across all European semi-natural vegetation types. The spatial pattern of vegetation change identifies land-use change, particularly land abandonment, as a major initiator of vegetation change both in- and outside of protected areas. The strongest LAI increases were observed in mild climates, consistent with more vigorous woody regrowth after cessation of intensive management in these environments. Surprisingly, rates of vegetation change within protected areas did not differ significantly from unprotected semi-natural vegetation. Overall, the detected LAI increases are consistent with previous, coarser-scale, studies. The evidence indicates that woody regrowth following land abandonment is an important driver of land surface greening throughout Europe. The results offer an explanation for the large discrepancies between ESM-derived and satellite-derived greening estimates and thus generate new avenues for improving the ESMs on which we rely for crucial climate forecasts.",,,,"Normand, Signe/A-1561-2012; Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019","Normand, Signe/0000-0002-8782-4154; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Buitenwerf, Robert/0000-0003-3356-2301",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [640176]; Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation [CF16-0005]; VILLUM FONDEN [16549],"European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, Grant/Award Number: 640176; Carlsberg Foundation, Grant/Award Number: CF16-0005; VILLUM FONDEN, Grant/Award Number: 16549",,,6,6,7,28,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, all three aspects of global change also acted independently to alter different functional groups in our flow-through marine rock-pool mesocosms. Specifically, warming reduced macroalgal biomass and assemblage productivity, whereas enrichment led to increased abundance of meso-invertebrate consumers, and loss of predator species led to increased gastropod grazer biomass. This disparity in responses, both across trophic levels (macroalgae and intermediate consumers), and between detecting additive effects on aggregate measures of ecosystem functioning, yet interactive effects on community composition, illustrates that our forecasting ability depends strongly on the level of ecological complexity incorporated within global change experiments. We conclude that biodiversity change-and loss of predator species in particular-plays a critical and overarching role in determining how ecological communities respond to stressors.",,,,"white, lydia/AAL-8460-2020","white, lydia/0000-0002-7531-5168; O'Connor, Nessa/0000-0002-3133-0913; Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448",Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland; Trinity College Dublin; Royal Society Research GrantRoyal Society of London [RG 120432],This study was completed as part of a PhD funded by the Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland with additional funding from Trinity College Dublin and a Royal Society Research Grant (RG 120432),,,4,4,6,48,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The limited taxonomic diversity and duration of most phenological datasets, however, have impeded a comprehensive, systematic determination of the best predictors of flowering phenology. Additionally, many studies of the relationship between climate conditions and plant phenology have included only a limited set of climate parameters that are often chosen a priori and may therefore overlook those parameters to which plants are most phenologically sensitive. This study harnesses 894,392 digital herbarium records and 1,959 in situ observations to produce the first assessment of the effects of a large number (25) of climate parameters on the flowering time of a very large number (2,468) of angiosperm taxa throughout North America. In addition, we compare the predictive capacity of phenological models constructed from the collection dates of herbarium specimens vs. repeated in situ observations of individual plants using a regression approach-elastic net regularization-that has not previously been used in phenological modeling, but exhibits several advantages over ordinary least squares and stepwise regression. When herbarium-derived data and in situ phenological observations were used to predict flowering onset, the multivariate models based on each of these data sources had similar predictive capacity (R-2 = 0.27). Further, apart from mean maximum temperature (TMAX), the two best predictors of flowering time have not commonly been included in phenological models: the number of frost-free days (NFFD) and the quantity of precipitation as snow (PAS) in the seasons preceding flowering. By vetting these models across an unprecedented number of taxa, this work demonstrates a new approach to phenological modeling.",,,,,"Park, Isaac/0000-0001-5539-1641",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1556768],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1556768",,,8,9,3,32,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Thus, understanding how species cope with contrasting climates may inform us about their potential for thermal adaptation and which processes may hamper that ability (e.g. evolutionary trade-offs, phenology or behavioural thermoregulation). In addition to temperature, time constraints may also exert important selective pressures. Here, we compare the thermal sensitivity of locomotion of metamorphic and adult European common frogs (Rana temporaria) originating from populations along an elevational gradient. We employed the template mode of variation (TMV) analysis to decompose the thermal sensitivity of locomotion and explore the existence of trade-offs ('hotter is better' and 'specialist-generalist') and the degree of local adaptation. To that end, we studied the relationship between TMV parameters and local environmental conditions. Further, we compared preferred temperatures to assess whether behavioural thermoregulation could dampen the effects of thermal variation, reducing the intensity of selection and limiting thermal adaptation (i.e. 'Bogert effect'). We suggest that behavioural thermoregulation has promoted the conservatism of thermal sensitivity in R. temporaria. Yet, we observed a trend towards narrower thermal niches shifted towards warmer temperature in populations with severe temporal constraints, conforming to the 'generalist-specialist' trade-off. Apparently, this enables time-constrained populations - especially in the case of metamorphs - to effectively exploit resources during the warmest periods. The limited potential of R. temporaria for thermal adaptation suggests that forecasts of global warming should incorporate thermoregulation and explore its potential to buffer species from rising temperatures.",,,,"Gonzalez-Nicieza, Alfredo Cesar/L-6285-2014; Enriquez-Urzelai, Urtzi/H-9778-2016","Gonzalez-Nicieza, Alfredo Cesar/0000-0003-4062-569X; Enriquez-Urzelai, Urtzi/0000-0001-5958-2250; Palacio, Antonio S/0000-0002-9511-6342",MINECO [CGL2012-40246-C02-02]; MECSpanish Government [BES-2013-063203],We thank Michael Jennions and two anonymous reviewers for greatly improving the paper.

Acquisition of parcels for a large terrestrial reserve is difficult because it typically occurs over a long timeframe and thus invokes consideration of future conditions such as climate and urbanization changes. In central Florida, the U.S. government has authorized a new protected area, the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge. The new refuge will host important threatened and endangered species and habitats, and will be located to allow for species adaptation from climate change impacts. For this study we combined habitat objectives defined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and projections from two urbanization models to provide guidance for Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge design. We used Marxan with Zones to find near-optimal solutions for protecting explicit amounts of five target habitats. We identified parcels for inclusion into the reserve design that the models allocated among two zones representing different methods of protection: fee-simple purchase (up to 20,234 ha authorized by the U.S. government), and conservation easement agreements (up to 40,469 ha authorized). As expected, for all scenarios we found an increase in costs as the proportion of fee-simple purchases was increased, reflecting the lesser cost of easements, but the number of parcels required for protection differed little among scenarios. The two urbanization models showed considerable agreement over which habitat patches they did not forecast to be developed, and some agreement over which parcels might be developed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may benefit from focusing on parcels that our analyses select frequently under both urban scenarios because these parcels are more likely to be in areas where there are fewer urbanization threats and a lower demand for land. The reserve designs we generated met U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service habitat goals within fee and easement zone restrictions, and we found reserve configurations that fell well below the mandated size limit.",,,,,,U.S. Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center,"The U.S. Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center provided funding for this work.

Here, we examine the trophic ecology and habitat use of North Atlantic leatherback turtles (St. Croix nesting population) and investigate the effects of large-scale oceanographic conditions on leatherback foraging dynamics. We used bulk and compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) to estimate leatherback trophic position (TP) over an 18-year period, compare these estimates with TP estimates from a Pacific leatherback population, and elucidate the pre-nesting habitat use patterns of leatherbacks. Our secondary objective was to use oceanographic indices and nesting information from St. Croix leatherbacks to evaluate relationships between trophic ecology, nesting parameters, and regional environmental conditions measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. We found no change in leatherback TP over time and no difference in TP between Atlantic and Pacific leatherbacks, indicating that differences in trophic ecology between populations are an unlikely driver of the population dichotomy between Pacific and Atlantic leatherbacks. Isotope data suggested that St. Croix leatherbacks inhabit multiple oceanic regions prior to nesting, although, like their conspecifics in the Pacific, individuals exhibit fidelity to specific foraging regions. Leatherback nesting parameters were weakly related to the NAO, which may suggest that positive NAO phases benefit St. Croix leatherbacks, potentially through increases in resource availability in their foraging areas. Our data contribute to the understanding of leatherback turtle ecology and potential mechanistic drivers of the dichotomy between populations of this protected species.",,,,,,Inter-university training in continental-scale ecology award from the National Science Foundation [1137336]; Boyd Lyon Sea Turtle Fund; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 GM007240]; Jean Marie Messier Memorial Foundation,"We would like to thank Dr. Kelly Stewart, Dr. Jeanne Garner, Claudia Lombard, Mike Evans, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The US Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources, and all employees and volunteers who assisted in field work at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge.

The modeling system includes the following components: (1) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), (2) Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), (3) Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC), and (4) Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The previously developed Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C), an advanced user interface, integrated EPIC with the WRF model and CMAQ. The FEST-C system, driven by process-based WRF weather simulations, includes atmospheric N additions to agricultural cropland and agricultural cropland contributions to ammonia emissions. This study focuses on integrating the watershed hydrology and water quality model with FEST-C system so that a full multimedia assessment on water quality in large river basins to address impacts of fertilization, meteorology, and atmospheric N deposition on water quality can be achieved. Objectives of this paper are to describe how to expand the previous effort by integrating the SWAT model with the FEST-C (CMAQ/WRF/EPIC) modeling system, as well as to demonstrate application of the Integrated Modeling System (IMS) to the Mississippi River basin (MRB) to simulate streamflow and dissolved N loadings to the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). IMS simulation results generally agree with US Geological Survey (USGS) observations/estimations; the annual simulated streamflow is 218.9 mm and USGS observation is 211.1 mm and the annual simulated dissolved N is 2.1 kg ha(-1) and the USGS estimation is 2.8 kg ha(-1). Integrating SWAT with the CMAQ/WRF/EPIC modeling system allows for its use within large river basins without losing EPIC's more detailed biogeochemistry processes, which will strengthen the assessment of impacts of future climate scenarios, regulatory and voluntary programs for N oxide air emissions, and land use and land management on N transport and transformation in large river basins.",,,,"Srinivasan, Raghavan/D-3937-2009; Wang, Ruoyu/D-2626-2014","Srinivasan, Raghavan/0000-0001-8375-6038; Wang, Ruoyu/0000-0003-3463-5939",United States Environmental Protection Agency through its Office of Research and DevelopmentUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency through its Office of Research and Development funded and managed the research described here.

We provide hourly fluxes of CO2 as net ecosystem exchange (NEE; mu molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) on a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid by adapting the Vegetation, Photosynthesis, and Respiration Model (VPRM) to the eastern half of China for the time period from 2005 to 2009; the minimal empirical parameterization of the VPRM-CHINA makes it well suited for inverse modeling approaches. This study diverges from previous VPRM applications in that it is applied at a large scale to China's ecosystems for the first time, incorporating a novel processing framework not previously applied to existing VPRM versions. In addition, the VPRM-CHINA model prescribes methods for addressing dual-cropping regions that have two separate growing-season modes applied to the same model grid cell. We evaluate the VPRM-CHINA performance during the growing season and compare to other biospheric models. We calibrate the VPRM-CHINA with ChinaFlux and FluxNet data and scale up regionally using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model v3.6.1 meteorology and MODIS surface reflectances. When combined with an anthropogenic emissions model in a Lagrangian particle transport framework, we compare the ability of VPRM-CHINA relative to an ensemble mean of global hourly flux models (NASA CMS - Carbon Monitoring System) to reproduce observations made at a site in northern China. The measurements are heavily influenced by the northern China administrative region. Modeled hourly time series using vegetation fluxes prescribed by VPRM-CHINA exhibit low bias relative to measurements during the May-September growing season. Compared to NASA CMS subset over the study region, VPRM-CHINA agrees significantly better with measurements. NASA CMS consistently underestimates regional uptake in the growing season. We find that during the peak growing season, when the heavily cropped North China Plain significantly influences measurements, VPRM-CHINA models a CO2 uptake signal comparable in magnitude to the modeled anthropogenic signal. In addition to demonstrating efficacy as a low-bias prior for top-down CO2 inventory optimization studies using ground-based measurements, high spatiotemporal resolution models such as the VPRM are critical for interpreting retrievals from global CO2 remote-sensing platforms such as OCO-2 and OCO-3 (planned). Depending on the satellite time of day and season of crossover, efforts to interpret the relative contribution of the vegetation and anthropogenic components to the measured signal are critical in key emitting regions such as northern China - where the magnitude of the vegetation CO2 signal is shown to be equivalent to the anthropogenic signal.",,,,"Nehrkorn, Thomas/R-9711-2019; Wang, Yuxuan/C-6902-2014; Munger, J William/H-4502-2013","Nehrkorn, Thomas/0000-0003-0637-3468; Wang, Yuxuan/0000-0002-1649-6974; Munger, J William/0000-0002-1042-8452; Dayalu, Archana/0000-0001-8663-9646",Harvard Global Institute; CDIAC; ICOS Ecosystem Thematic Center; OzFlux office; ChinaFlux office; AsiaFlux office; Harvard-China Project,"We thank the Harvard-China Project and the Harvard Global Institute for funding this study; Zhiming Kuang for providing computational resources; Lu Hu, Jialin Liu, and Jenna Samra for helpful discussion; Mary Haley for assistance with NCL; and Shiping Chen and Haijun Peng for providing assistance with eddy flux data from CN-Du2 and CN-Yuc, respectively.

In order to understand fall armyworm's year-round, global, potential distribution, we used evidence of the effects of temperature and precipitation on fall armyworm life-history, combined with data on native and African distributions to construct Species Distribution Models (SDMs). We also investigated the strength of trade and transportation pathways that could carry fall armyworm beyond Africa. Up till now, fall armyworm has only invaded areas that have a climate similar to the native distribution, validating the use of climatic SDMs. The strongest climatic limits on fall armyworm's year-round distribution are the coldest annual temperature and the amount of rain in the wet season. Much of sub-Saharan Africa can host year-round fall armyworm populations, but the likelihoods of colonising North Africa and seasonal migrations into Europe arc hard to predict.

The findings generally confirmed the failure of introductions of Gammarus pulex into sites previously dominated by the native Gammarus duebeni celticus even with high propagule pressure in terms of numbers of individual invaders released and repeated introductions. Despite this, the island-wide 2015 survey revealed that G. d. celticus occurred in fewer sites and G. pulex in more sites than a decade earlier, indicating at this island-wide scale, the displacement of G. pulex by G. d. celticus seems to be continuing. In addition, one of the introduction sites, Arbory Stream which contained G. d. celticus from 1951-2005 contained only G. pulex in 2015, showing that even after six decades, assumptions cannot be made as to the limits of invader range expansion. Multivariate analysis of physico-chemical data from the 2015 island-wide survey revealed water quality as a crucial environmental gradient that influences the distributions of the native and invader species, with the former in higher organic water quality sites than sites with the invader or where invader and native co-occurred. The North American amphipod Crangonyx pseudogracilis had expanded its range since 2005, including invading low biological water quality sites previously devoid of both Gammarus spp.. Pollution from historic metal mining is implicated as a potential major factor excluding amphipods. This deliberate ecological experiment, through long-term monitoring, continues to provide insights into the factors determining the distributions of natives and invaders.",,,,,,Open Access Publishing Fund of the International Association for Open Knowledge on Invasive Alien Species (INVASIVESNET),The publication of this article is supported by the Open Access Publishing Fund of the International Association for Open Knowledge on Invasive Alien Species (INVASIVESNET).,,,1,1,2,6,,,,1798-6540,1818-5487,,AQUAT INVASIONS,Aquat.

It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Wuest, Rafael O/G-6070-2012; Schroder, Boris/N-7250-2019; Calabrese, Justin/B-9131-2012; Warton, David/B-5791-2009","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Wuest, Rafael O/0000-0001-6047-1945; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Calabrese, Justin/0000-0003-0575-6408; Warton, David/0000-0001-9441-6645; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794; Barton, Kamil/0000-0001-5562-8274; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950; Matechou, Eleni/0000-0003-3626-844X","German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [DO 786/9-1]; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DO 786/10-1, SCHR1000/6-2, SCHR1000/8-2, FZT 118]; Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council [FT120100501]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through the German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; ARCAustralian Research Council [DE160100904, FT0991640, DP160101003]; Australia's National Environmental Research Program (NERP) Environmental Decisions Hub; National Science Center [DEC-2015/16/S/NZ8/00158]; German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [BMBF 01LL0901A]; European Research Council under the European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [281422]","We are grateful to five meticulous reviewers and the editor for providing substantial and constructive feedback, which greatly improved the previous versions of this manuscript.

This problem has been studied extensively in a different context by theoreticians evaluating the coexistence of species in spatially heterogeneous environments. Here, we show how spatial coexistence theory can be adapted to provide a mathematical framework for understanding species persistence in competitive communities under climate change. We first show how the spatial low-density growth rate provides the relevant metric of species persistence along a climate gradient. We then analyse a model of multiple migrating competitors to show how mechanisms contributing to low-density growth rates quantify the effect of different competitive processes on persistence, and how these processes change in strength with species' asynchronous migration under climate change. Finally, we outline the empirical utility of the framework, showing how the theory can scale up from local measurements of species performance and competitive interactions to range-scale metrics of persistence. Treating species' range dynamics as a geographical-scale coexistence problem presents its own set of challenges, but building from a well-established body of theory may greatly improve the predictability of species persistence in competitive communities under climate change.",,,,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014",,Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_173210],The authors acknowledge support from Swiss National Science Foundation award 31003A_173210.

However, the dispersal process is multi-causal, which currently hinders predictions regarding a species' resilience to global change. We used a multifaceted approach to disentangle the relative importance of a suite of dispersal-related factors in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus, including condition- (morphology and behavior) and context- (environmental) dependent factors. Experiments were conducted at an experimental platform dedicated to study dispersal, the Metatron, to record emigration propensity in two-patch experimental metapopulations under different environmental conditions. The butterflies' individual condition was subsequently assessed in the laboratory. Individual condition did not generally influence emigration propensity. We detected a significant sex bias in emigration propensity, being generally higher in females than in males, but in a context-dependent manner. The environmental context affected emigration propensity, which was higher when habitat quality was poor. Our results show that emigration is not random in L. tityrus, but is rather an active process triggered by sex and habitat quality. Our main finding was that individual condition, and particularly flight ability measured by a performance test, was not related to emigration propensity in experimental metapopulations. Our results may have important implications for forecasting future species distributions, as deteriorating environmental contexts are likely to increase emigration whatever the individual condition is.",,,,,,"DFG research training group RESPONSEGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG GRK 2010]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) through the INDHET grant; Laboratoire d'Excellence TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41]; ""Investissements d'avenir"" program from the Agence Nationale de la rechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-INBS-0001AnaEE-Services]","We thank Delphine Legrand, Olivier Guillaume, Olivier Calvez, and Julien Cote for technical support and helpful suggestions, and two anonymous reviewers and Simon Ducatez for constructive criticism on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Uncertainty over the causes of such non-additivity among multiple stressors confounds forecasts of their net ecological impact. Although stressors can interact directly within the environment to mediate their combined effects on communities, species interactions likely also play key roles. Here, we use a simulation model to explore how species interactions cause community responses (changes in species richness and total biomass) to paired stressors to differ from what we would expect based on the individual effects of each stressor (the additive effect). We demonstrate how interspecific interactions cause communities to respond non-additively to stressors, and how this depends on whether these interactions are negative or positive and whether the stressors have positive or negative impacts on the community property of interest. When pairwise species interactions involve at least one negative interaction (i.e., competition or predation), stressors combine to have greater than expected negative impacts (e.g., species or biomass loss) and less than expected positive impacts (e.g., biomass increases). In contrast, reciprocally positive interactions between species (i.e., facilitation) generally cause stressors to have additive, or slightly less than additive, net effects on species richness and community biomass. While species interactions determine the nature of the combined impact of multiple stressors (i.e., greater than or less than expected), species co-tolerance and stressor timing (i.e., sequential vs simultaneous application) only modify the magnitude of this effect. These findings highlight how interactions among species can contribute to non-additive responses by communities to environmental change, in addition to those caused by interactions among stressors themselves.",,,,"Thompson, Patrick L/B-6213-2012","Thompson, Patrick L/0000-0002-5278-9045",Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,PLT is supported by a Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada Discovery grant awarded to RDV.,,,1,1,4,17,,,,2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,NOV,2018,9,11,,,,,,,e02518,10.1002/ecs2.2518,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000452621900003,,,,,

However, the responses to multiple stressors, such as those above, are often complex and there is contradictory evidence as to how they may interact. Here we used broad scale data from 494 lakes in central and northern Europe, to assess how cyanobacteria respond to nutrients (phosphorus), temperature and water retention time in different types of lakes. Eight lake types were examined based on factorial combinations of major factors that determine phytoplankton composition and sensitivity to nutrients: alkalinity (low and medium-high), colour (clear and humic) and mixing intensity (polymictic and stratified). In line with expectations, cyanobacteria increased with temperature and retention time in five of the eight lake types. Temperature effects were greatest in lake types situated at higher latitudes, suggesting that lakes currently not at risk could be affected by warming in the future. However, the sensitivity of cyanobacteria to temperature, retention time and phosphorus varied among lake types highlighting the complex responses of lakes to multiple stressors. For example, in polymictic, medium-high alkalinity, humic lakes cyanobacteria biovolume was positively explained by retention time and a synergy between TP and temperature, while in polymictic, medium-high alkalinity, clear lakes only retention time was identified as an explanatory variable. These results show that, although climate change will need to be accounted for when managing the risk of cyanobacteria in lakes, a ""one-size fits-all"" approach is not appropriate. When forecasting the response of cyanobacteria to future environmental change, including changes caused by climate and local management, it will be important to take this differential sensitivity of lakes into account.",,,,"Maberly, Stephen C/J-3361-2012; Moe, Jannicke/AAC-8121-2020; Taylor, Philip/E-5143-2015; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Hunter, Peter D/B-8010-2008; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009","Maberly, Stephen C/0000-0003-3541-5903; Moe, Jannicke/0000-0002-3681-3551; Taylor, Philip/0000-0003-1663-9426; Hunter, Peter D/0000-0001-7269-795X; Carvalho, Laurence/0000-0002-9768-9902; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Richardson, Jessica/0000-0002-3723-2361",Seventh Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU) [603378],"Seventh Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 603378",,,14,15,13,66,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Attempts are underway to reintroduce blight-resistant chestnut to its former range, but it is uncertain how current forest composition, climate, and atmospheric changes and disturbance regimes will interact to determine future forest dynamics and ecosystem services. The combination of novel environmental conditions (e.g. climate change), a reintroduced tree species and new disturbance regimes (e.g. exotic insect pests, fire suppression) have no analog in the past that can be used to parameterize phenomenological models. We therefore used a mechanistic approach within the LANDIS-II forest landscape model that relies on physiological first principles to project forest dynamics as the outcome of competition of tree cohorts for light and water as a function of temperature, precipitation, CO2 concentration, and life history traits. We conducted a factorial landscape simulation experiment to evaluate specific hypotheses about future forest dynamics in two study sites in the center of the former range of chestnut. Our results supported the hypotheses that climate change would favor chestnut because of its optimal temperature range and relative drought resistance, and that chestnut would be less competitive in the more mesic Appalachian Plateau province because competitors will be less stressed. The hypothesis that chestnut will increase carbon stocks was supported, although the increase was modest. Our results confirm that aggressive restoration is needed regardless of climate and soils, and that increased aggressiveness of chestnut restoration increased biomass accumulation. The hypothesis that chestnut restoration will increase both compositional and structural richness was not supported because chestnut displaced some species and age cohorts. Although chestnut restoration did not markedly enhance carbon stocks, our findings provide hope that this formerly important species can be successfully reintroduced and associated ecosystem services recovered.",,,,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774; Miranda, Brian/0000-0002-3506-8297; Gustafson, Eric/0000-0002-9506-3199; Jacobs, Douglass/0000-0002-5580-2516",National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [105321],"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 105321",,,2,2,3,29,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Adults, males and higher quality individuals typically arrive earlier, and across years, early arrival has been linked to warmer spring temperatures. However, the mechanisms and potential costs of early arrival are not well understood. To deepen the understanding of arrival date differences between individuals and years, we studied them in light of the preceding spring migration behaviour and atmospheric conditions en route. GPS and body acceleration (ACC) data were obtained for 35 adult white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over five years (2012-2016). ACC records were translated to energy expenditure estimates (overall dynamic body acceleration; ODBA) and to behavioural modes, and GPS fixes were coupled with environmental parameters. At the interindividual level (within years), early arrival was attributed primarily to departing earlier for migration and from more northern wintering sites (closer to breeding grounds), rather than to migration speed. In fact, early-departing birds flew slower, experienced weaker thermal uplifts and expended more energy during flight, but still arrived earlier, emphasizing the cost and the significance of early departure. Individuals that wintered further south arrived later at the breeding grounds but did not produce fewer fledglings, presumably due to positive carry-over effects of advantageous wintering conditions (increased precipitation, vegetation productivity and daylight time). Therefore, early arrival increased breeding success only after controlling for wintering latitude. Males arrived slightly ahead of females. Between years, late arrival was linked to colder temperatures en route through two different mechanisms: stronger headwinds causing slower migration and lower thermal uplifts resulting in longer stopovers. This study showed that distinct migratory properties underlie arrival time variation within and between years. It highlighted (a) an overlooked cost of early arrival induced by unfavourable atmospheric conditions during migration, (b) an important fitness trade-off in storks between arrival date and wintering habitat quality and (c) mechanistic explanations for the negative temperature-arrival date correlation in soaring birds. Such understanding of arrival time can facilitate forecasting migrating species responses to climate changes.",,,,"Sapir, Nir/V-9634-2019; Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008; Zurell, Damaris/E-2439-2012","Sapir, Nir/0000-0002-2477-0515; Zurell, Damaris/0000-0002-4628-3558","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [NA 846/1-1, WI 3576/1-1]; Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Ministry of Science and Technology","DFG, Grant/Award Number: NA 846/1-1 and WI 3576/1-1; Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Ministry of Science and Technology",,,8,8,7,65,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Given their vulnerability to local extinction, the reintroduction of megafauna species (often long-lived, ecologically influential and highly social) is an increasingly relevant conservation intervention. Studies that evaluate past megafauna reintroductions are both critical and rare. 2. Between 1981 and 1996, 12 cohorts of a total of 200 juvenile (< 5 years old) African savannah elephants Loxodonta africana africana were reintroduced to Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), South Africa, after 100 years of absence. Here, we model the population's long-term growth. We also present data on the current (2016) age class distribution and social dynamics of the population based on a year of intensive vehicle-based monitoring of 16 collared adult females and their family groups. 3. Exponential population growth (7.1% annual increase) between 1996 and 2014 suggests reintroduction success but has created concerns about overpopulation (with contraception of females implemented since 2014 to suppress reproduction). The age class distribution has normalized as the juveniles have aged; reproductive females (> 10 years old) composed 30% of the population in 2016. The population remains relatively young and forecasts suggest high potential for sustained growth over the next decade. 4. The first calf was born to a reintroduced female in 1990 and since then mother-calf units have gradually developed into semi-independent multi-generation families (7-15 individuals in size in 2016). The size of observed cow-calf groups was highly variable (mean = 21.4 individuals, range: 7-109), with repeat observation of individual collared females revealing fusion and fission among different family groups through time, as is typical of more natural elephant populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. From an unusual founder population of reintroduced juvenile elephants, we document rapid population growth and the development of normal sociality over 35 years. While this may be an encouragement for megaherbivore reintroductions in general, the potential for exponential population growth must be carefully considered when ecologically influential species are introduced to closed systems. Our study provides key long-term insights for elephant translocations, which are becoming increasingly necessary due to overpopulation in some areas and local extinction in others.",,,,,"Druce, Dave/0000-0003-2976-6029; Kuiper, Timothy/0000-0003-2502-4028",Rufford Foundation [20964-1]; Gower Trust South Africa; EKZNW,"Rufford Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 20964-1; Gower Trust South Africa; EKZNW",,,0,0,3,27,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Models can help anticipate the consequences on future biotic dynamics, e.g. vegetation. In rugged terrain, forecasts should consider fine-scale spatial variability in environmental conditions that are proximally linked to plant performance. Here, we forecasted Arctic plant community response to future climate change using high-resolution environmental variables. Location Methods Zackenberg in the High Arctic of Greenland. Using a combination of remote-sensing data and field measurements, we interpolated soil moisture and temperature at 1 m resolution together with spatial data on snow cover and solar radiation. We calibrated stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) with data from 200 vegetation plots. To explore the sensitivity of Arctic communities to climate change, we forecasted these models under simulated increases in temperature and changes (positive or negative) in snow cover and soil moisture, corresponding to more winter and/or summer precipitation and higher frequencies of summer droughts. Results Main conclusions S-SDMs associated with high-resolution environmental variables were able to reproduce the spatial variation in species richness and plant community structure along a mountain slope in Zackenberg. Model forecasts under climate change revealed that most species reacted to a combination of changes in soil moisture and temperature, and changes in these two variables resulted in an extensive restructuring of the distributions of species assemblages. In most scenarios, a gradual homogenization of communities was forecasted due to shrub expansion. Increasing temperatures and altered soil moisture were predicted to turn the currently highly heterogeneous tundra landscape at Zackenberg into homogenous dwarf-shrub tundra. Such homogenization of vegetation communities may have profound ramifications for species, interaction webs, and ecosystem processes via modifications to the surface albedo, energy and water balance, as well as snow accumulation and permafrost.",,,,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020; Schmidt, Niels Martin/G-3843-2011","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Schmidt, Niels Martin/0000-0002-4166-6218",Maersk Oil Kalaallit Nunaat A/S; Danish Environmental Protection Agency; VILLUM FONDEN [16549],"Maersk Oil Kalaallit Nunaat A/S; Danish Environmental Protection Agency; VILLUM FONDEN, Grant/Award Number: 16549",,,3,3,5,29,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Biotic stressors such as hemiparasites have a profound impact on forest functioning. However, predicting the future incidence of these stressors on forests remains challenging because climate-based distribution does not consider tree-hemiparasite interactions or the impacts of extreme climate events on stressors' performance. 2. We use species distribution models (SDMs) and ecophysiological and demographic field data to assess whether climatic suitability is a proxy for the performance of the hemiparasite mistletoe (Viscum album) in two forests with contrasting climatic conditions. Two host tree species representing wet-cold (Scots pine) and dry-warm (Aleppo pine) conditions were selected. We fitted SDMs based on climate variables, and measured different ecophysiological variables capturing cold- (photoinhibition) and drought tolerance (intrinsic water-use efficiency, iWUE). We also assessed demographic variables related to seed germination and establishment rates of mistletoe through a translocation experiment. 3. Species distribution models showed a high climatic suitability of mistletoe in both forests. Mistletoes living in the Scots pines site presented a higher cold tolerance, while those inhabiting the Aleppo pine site showed a higher iWUE. Seedlings coming from local seeds showed a lower mortality than seedlings coming from translocated seeds. Germination and seedling establishment showed temporal mismatches when comparing local and translocated seeds. 4. Synthesis. Habitat suitability predicted by SDMs based on climate data and field performance were related in this mistletoe species. However, ecophysiological and demographic variables indicated a lower fitness of mistletoe in the dry-warm site associated with drought stress. In conclusion, predicted climate suitability based on SDMs forecasts should be refined using field data on actual performance and considering plant-to-plant interactions and extreme climate events.",,,,"Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015; Peguero-Pina, Jose Javier/M-4494-2014; Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio/M-5129-2014","Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543; Peguero-Pina, Jose Javier/0000-0002-8903-2935; Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio/0000-0002-4053-6681; Sanguesa-Barreda, Gabriel/0000-0002-7722-2424",Spanish Ministry of Economy [CGL2015-69186-C2-1-R],"Spanish Ministry of Economy, Grant/Award Number: CGL2015-69186-C2-1-R",,,3,3,1,12,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Whilst many studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on aboveground plant-insect interactions, those belowground remain relatively unexplored. Root herbivores can be the dominant taxa in grasslands, potentially altering plant community dynamics. To better predict the impact of climate change on grasslands, we subjected four Australian pasture grasses (Cynodon dactylon, Paspalum dilatatum, Microlaena stipoides and Lolium perenne) to contrasting rainfall regimes [a press drought (i.e. sustained, moderate water stress), a pulse drought (water stress followed by periodic, infrequent deluge event) and a well-watered control], with and without root herbivores; a manual root cutting treatment was also included for comparison. Plant growth, rooting strategy, phenology and biochemistry were measured to evaluate above and belowground treatment responses. Watering treatments had a larger effect on plant productivity than root damage treatments: press drought and pulse drought treatments reduced biomass by 58% and 47%, respectively. Root herbivore damage effects were species dependent and were not always equivalent to root cutting. The combination of pulse drought and root herbivory resulted in increased root:shoot ratios for both P. dilatatum and L. perenne, as well as decreased biomass and delayed flowering time for P. dilatatum. Plant biomass responses to root damage were greatest under well-watered conditions; however, root damage also delayed or prevented investment in reproduction in at least one species. Our findings highlight the important role of soil-dwelling invertebrates for forecasting growth responses of grassland communities to future rainfall regime changes.",,,,,"Johnson, Scott/0000-0002-8388-8345",,,,,0,0,4,28,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2018,188,3,,,,,777,789,,10.1007/s00442-018-4244-x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000447870100012,30099604,,,,

Maintaining long-term studies capable of estimating demographic parameters for long-lived, slow-reproducing species is challenging. Insights into the effects of research intensity on the statistical power to estimate demographic parameters are limited. Here, we investigate implications of survey effort on estimating abundance, home range sizes, and reproductive output of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), using a 3-year subsample of a long-term, capture-recapture study off Bunbury, Western Australia. Photo-identification on individual dolphins was collected following Pollock's Robust Design, where seasons were defined as ""primary periods"", each consisting of multiple ""secondary periods."" The full dataset consisted of 12 primary periods and 72 secondary periods, resulting in the study area being surveyed 24 times/year. We simulated reduced survey effort by randomly removing one, two, or three secondary periods per primary period. Capture-recapture models were used to assess the effect of survey intensity on the power to detect trends in population abundance, while individual dolphin sighting histories were used to assess the ability to conduct home range analyses. We used sighting records of adult females and their calving histories to assess survey effort on quantifying reproductive output. A 50% reduction in survey effort resulted in (a) up to a 36% decline in population abundance at the time of detection; (b) a reduced ability to estimate home range sizes, by increasing the time for individuals to be sighted on >= 30 occasions (an often-used metric for home range analyses) from 7.74 to 14.32 years; and (c) 33%, 24%, and 33% of annual calving events across three years going undocumented, respectively.

Because processes at different scales are explicit in such models, careful assessments of their predictive abilities can provide valuable insights that will be relevant to functionally similar species. However, there are surprisingly few comprehensive field tests of mechanistic niche models in the literature. We applied a general, thermodynamically grounded modeling framework to determine the fundamental niche of an extremely well-studied herbivorous ectotherm, the sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa. We then compared the model predictions with detailed long-term field observations that included sub-hourly data on microclimate, activity levels, home ranges, and body temperatures as well as annual to decadal patterns of body condition and growth. Body temperature predictions inferred from gridded climatic data were within 10% of empirically observed values and explained >70% of observed daytime activity patterns across all lizards. However, some periods of activity restriction were explained by predicted desiccation level rather than by temperature, and metabolically driven activity requirements were much lower than potential activity time. Decadal trajectories of field growth and body condition could also be explained to within 10% of observed values, with the variance in trajectories being attributable to whether individuals had access to permanent water. Continent-wide applications of the model partly captured the inland distribution limit, but only after accounting for water limitations. Predicted changes in habitat suitability under six climate change scenarios were generally positive within the species' current range, but varied strongly with predicted rainfall. Temperature is regarded as the major factor that will restrict the distribution and abundance of lizards and other terrestrial ectotherms under climate change. Yet our findings show how water can be more important than temperature in constraining the activity, habitat requirements, and distribution limits of terrestrial ectotherms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of first-principles computation of the climatic limits on terrestrial animals from gridded environmental data, providing a coherent picture for how species will respond to climate change at different scales of space and time.",,,,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017; Munns, Suzy/B-8276-2013","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Munns, Suzy/0000-0002-5688-4680; Malishev, Matthew/0000-0002-8507-4433","ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [DP140101240, DP110102813, DP0877384]; Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative (Melbourne Bioinformatics); Australia and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 13/5]","This work was supported by ARC Discovery grants DP140101240 and DP110102813 to M.

Having the potential to outcompete or consume native species, it is particularly important to remove them from islands harbouring unique flora and fauna. Lord Howe Island, a World Heritage listed area to the east of the Australian mainland, is in the midst of a long-term weed management project, where the most prolific invasive species is cherry guava, with over 700,000 plants removed so far. In such projects, it is critical to have a good understanding of the invasion dynamics and removal process to have reliable estimates of project timeline and success, and to ensure the best removal strategies are being utilised. In this paper we model cherry guava growth, spread and removal on Lord Howe Island, fitting our model to 12 years of removal data. Our mean estimate is that there are 102,091 plants remaining on the island, which will take approximately 25 years to remove at current levels of eradication effort. Altering the strategy to search every year, rather than biennially, reduces the eradication time to 20 years, which falls within the project target, while also decreasing the total search effort. However, simply increasing search effort to finish faster actually increases the total eradication effort. This shows that the benefits of making careful adjustments to a strategy can far out-weight the benefit of simply investing more money into control. This project exemplifies how high-quality removal record-keeping can be used to generate models that provide important long-term forecasts of project success and suggest effective strategic improvements.",,,,"Bode, Michael/P-1333-2019","Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Baker, Christopher/0000-0001-9449-3632",Science and Industry Endowment Fund; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,The authors would like to thank Jose Lahoz-Monfort for his advice.

However, other environmental factors (for example, nutrient availability) may alter how seagrasses respond to CO2(aq) by regulating the supply of additional resources required to support growth. Thus, questions remain in regard to how other factors influence CO2(aq) effects on submerged vegetation. This study factorially manipulated CO2(aq) and nutrient availability, in situ, within a subtropical seagrass bed for 350days, and examined treatment effects on leaf productivity, shoot density, above- and belowground biomass, nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, and sediment organic carbon (C-org). Clear, open-top chambers were used to replicate CO2(aq) forecasts for the year 2100, whereas nutrient availability was manipulated via sediment amendments of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer. We provide modest evidence of a CO2 effect, which increased seagrass aboveground biomass. CO2(aq) enrichment had no effect on nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, or sediment C-org content. Nutrient addition increased leaf productivity and leaf N content, however did not alter above- or belowground biomass, shoot density, carbohydrate storage, or C-org content. Treatment interactions were not significant, and thus NP availability did not influence seagrass responses to elevated CO2(aq). This study demonstrates that long-term carbon enrichment may alter the structure of shallow seagrass meadows, even in relatively nutrient-poor, oligotrophic systems.",,,,"Fourqurean, James/B-4606-2008","Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500",National Science Foundation through the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecologi-cal Research Program [DBI-0620409]; Graduate School Doctoral Evidence Acquisition Fellowship by Florida International University,"We thank Dr. Patrick Rice and the Florida Keys Community College for logistical support.

Consequently, understanding what drives variation in forest microclimate is critical to forecasting ecosystem responses to global change, particularly in the tropics where many species already operate close to their thermal limits and rapid land-use transformation is profoundly altering local environments. Yet our ability to characterize forest microclimate at ecologically meaningful scales remains limited, as understorey conditions cannot be directly measured from outside the canopy. To address this challenge, we established a network of microclimate sensors across a land-use intensity gradient spanning from old-growth forests to oil-palm plantations in Borneo. We then combined these observations with high-resolution airborne laser scanning data to characterize how topography and canopy structure shape variation in microclimate both locally and across the landscape. In the processes, we generated high-resolution microclimate surfaces spanning over 350 km(2), which we used to explore the potential impacts of habitat degradation on forest regeneration under both current and future climate scenarios. We found that topography and vegetation structure were strong predictors of local microclimate, with elevation and terrain curvature primarily constraining daily mean temperatures and vapour pressure deficit (VPD), whereas canopy height had a clear dampening effect on microclimate extremes. This buffering effect was particularly pronounced on wind-exposed slopes but tended to saturate once canopy height exceeded 20 m-suggesting that despite intensive logging, secondary forests remain largely thermally buffered. Nonetheless, at a landscape-scale microclimate was highly heterogeneous, with maximum daily temperatures ranging between 24.2 and 37.2 degrees C and VPD spanning two orders of magnitude. Based on this, we estimate that by the end of the century forest regeneration could be hampered in degraded secondary forests that characterize much of Borneo's lowlands if temperatures continue to rise following projected trends.",,,,"Elias, Dafydd M/L-6532-2018; Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Swinfield, Tom/AAA-1518-2020","Elias, Dafydd M/0000-0002-2674-9285; Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Swinfield, Tom/0000-0001-9354-5090",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K016377/1]; Sime Darby Foundation,"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/K016377/1; Sime Darby Foundation",,,14,14,7,43,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Sediment accumulation rates determined by counting and measurement of annual laminations (varves) provide an accurate and precise chronology, enabling the minimum recovery time after a tephra fall to be determined. In most cases, pollen accumulation rate was reduced after the tephra fall, indicating reduced vegetation productivity. Tephra deposition events also led to changes in vegetation composition, although these varied in magnitude. The magnitude and duration of the impacts upon the vegetation were related to the thickness of the tephra layer deposited, the thickest layers examined (>250mm) having minimum recovery times of up to a century and thicker layers generally having greater impacts upon pollen productivity and vegetation composition. Tephra chemistry also influenced the persistence of the impact. The nature of the prevailing vegetation prior to the tephra fall influenced the degree and persistence of the impact. Tephra layers <30mm thick had minimum recovery times of up to 90years when they fell on wooded steppe vegetation, whereas cold steppe recovered much more quickly, as did forest. The relative sensitivity of wooded steppe was contrary to our expectations. Of individual pollen taxa, Cupressaceae emerged as particularly sensitive to tephra deposition.Synthesis. Applying absolute pollen analytical methods to a sediment record with a well-supported and precise chronology obtained from a lake in a volcanic region where the vegetation has been subject to numerous tephra deposition events enabled us to explore the impacts of such events. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts upon individual plant taxa and of differential sensitivity of three vegetation types that have prevailed in the region during the last glacial-interglacial cycle.

Identifying ecological niche filters that shape species community composition is a critical first step in understanding the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring communities. Systems with harsh ecological filters often have a more deterministic basis to community structure. Although these filters are often treated as static, investigations into their stability through time are rare, particularly in combination with extreme forms of environmental change such as drought. 2. We examined the richness and composition of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities from 36 ponds over 4 years during the onset of a megadrought to answer the following questions: (a) what are the relative influences of non-native fish presence and pond permanence in structuring communities? And (b) how do the magnitudes of such filters vary through time? 3. As predicted, fish presence had a strong, negative effect on both alpha and gamma diversity, lowering average invertebrate richness in pond communities by 23%. However, fish presence and sample year interacted to determine both richness and taxa composition: as drought conditions intensified, the effects of fish weakened such that there were no differences in the richness or composition between fish and fishless ponds by the later sampling years. Moreover, large-bodied invertebrate groups-often considered highly vulnerable to fish predation-were detected within fish-occupied sites by the final year of the study. 4. This pattern was associated with progressive decreases in precipitation due to a severe drought in California, emphasising the importance of exogenous, regional factors in moderating the strength of biotic niche filters on local community structure over time. Given that all detected fish species were non-native, these results also have application to understanding and forecasting changes in the diversity of aquatic invertebrates in response to biological invasions.",,,,,,"Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [080841758, 1149308]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM109499]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation","Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 080841758, 1149308; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01GM109499; David and Lucile Packard Foundation",,,1,1,1,20,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Understanding and predicting widespread tree mortality events in the future is vital as they affect ecosystem goods and services provided by forests and woodlands, including carbon storage needed to help offset warming. Additionally, if extensive enough, tree die-off events can influence not only local climate but also climate and vegetation elsewhere via ecoclimate teleconnections. Consequently, recent efforts have focused on improving predictions of tree mortality. One of the most commercially important genera of trees is Pinus, and the most studied species globally for drought-induced tree mortality is pinon pine, Pinus edulis. Numerous metrics have been developed in association with predicting mortality thresholds or variations in mortality for this species. In this article, we compiled metrics associated with drought and warming related mortality that were developed for P. edulis or for which P. edulis was a key example species used in a calculation or prediction. We grouped these metrics into three categories: (i) those related to simple climate variables, (ii) those related to physiological responses, and (iii) those that require multi-step calculations or modeling using climate, ecohydrological, and/or ecophysiological data; and we identified the spatial-temporal scale of each of these metrics. We also compiled factors shown to modify rates or sensitivities of mortality. The metrics to predict mortality include empirical ones which often have implicit linkages to expected mechanisms, and more mechanistic ones related to physiological drivers. The metrics for P. edulis have similarities with those available for other species of Pinus. Expected future mortality events will provide an opportunity to observationally and experimentally test and compare these metrics related to tree mortality for P. edulis via near-term ecological forecasting. The metrics for P. edulis may also be useful as potential analogs for other genera. Improving predictions of tree mortality for this species and others will be increasingly important as an aid to move toward anticipatory management.",,,,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1833529, DEB-1833502, DEB-1833505];  [EF-1340624];  [EF-1550756];  [EAR-1331408];  [EAR-1659546];  [OISE-1748275];  [OISE-1748204]","This work was supported primarily by NSF DEB-1833529 to Colorado State University, DEB-1833502 to University of Arizona, and DEB-1833505 to Northern Arizona University.

This was done by combining the best available information from observations and chemical transport models. Specifically, by (1) incorporating PM10 surface daily concentrations and model results from the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) ensemble; and (2) spreading the forecast corrections from the observation locations to the entire gridded domain covered by model forecasts by means of a data regularization approach. Results were verified against independent PM10 observations measured at 169 stations by local Environmental Protection Agencies. Twelve months of observations were matched in time and space, from January to December 2017, with air pollution model results. The studied domain encompassed the Po Valley, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, and that still does not meet the air quality criteria for the annual average concentration and the maximum number of exceedances allowed for the particulate matter. Raw model data were found to be affected by a bias with a strong seasonal dependency: a large negative bias in winter and a small bias in the summer months. The data assimilation approach, embedded into a Bayesian hierarchical approach, was able to drastically reduce the bias. Furthermore, an advanced computational approach, based on the variational Bayes method coupled with the minimization of the Kullback Leibler divergence to approximate the optimal solution, made it possible to cost-effectively assimilate data throughout the period under consideration. By using stratified cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R-2 ( = 0.83) and an average decrease of about two-thirds of the root mean square error. Assimilated data were used to produce daily resolved cumulative population exposures. The Po Valley, in relation to the interim targets (ITs) defined by the World Health Organization, accomplishes the IT-2 level, that is to say that the average annual concentration is lower than 50 mu g/m(3), but it is still very far from the IT-3 level, corresponding to an average annual concentration of less than 30 mu g/m(3). Moreover, most of the Po Valley still has a high number of days in which the average daily concentration is higher than 50 mu g/m(3), well above the maximum limit of 35 days established by European and Italian legislation. Our results demonstrate that PM10 can be reproduced reliably using this assimilation approach, combining different sources of information, so as to perform a thorough diagnosis of air quality over a spatially and temporally uniform area.",,,,"Riccio, Angelo/F-7795-2012","Riccio, Angelo/0000-0001-7775-5565",,,,,5,5,0,11,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Similarly, the ability to attach quantitative statements of uncertainty around model forecasts is crucial for model assessment and interpretation and for setting field research priorities. Bayesian methods provide a rigorous data assimilation framework for these applications, especially for problems with multiple data constraints. However, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques underlying most Bayesian calibration can be prohibitive for computationally demanding models and large datasets. We employ an alternative method, Bayesian model emulation of sufficient statistics, that can approximate the full joint posterior density, is more amenable to parallelization, and provides an estimate of parameter sensitivity. Analysis involved informative priors constructed from a meta-analysis of the primary literature and specification of both model and data uncertainties, and it introduced novel approaches to autocorrelation corrections on multiple data streams and emulating the sufficient statistics surface. We report the integration of this method within an ecological workflow management software, Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), and its application and validation with two process-based terrestrial ecosystem models: SIPNET and ED2. In a test against a synthetic dataset, the emulator was able to retrieve the true parameter values. A comparison of the emulator approach to standard ""bruteforce"" MCMC involving multiple data constraints showed that the emulator method was able to constrain the faster and simpler SIPNET model's parameters with comparable performance to the brute-force approach but reduced computation time by more than 2 orders of magnitude. The emulator was then applied to calibration of the ED2 model, whose complexity precludes standard (brute-force) Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Both models are constrained after assimilation of the observational data with the emulator method, reducing the uncertainty around their predictions. Performance metrics showed increased agreement between model predictions and data. Our study furthers efforts toward reducing model uncertainties, showing that the emulator method makes it possible to efficiently calibrate complex models.",,,,"Richardson, Andrew D./F-5691-2011; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009","Richardson, Andrew D./0000-0002-0148-6714; Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; fer, istem/0000-0001-8236-303X","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1318164, 1241891]; NASA Terrestrial Ecosystems; NSF (ABI) [1062547, 1458021]; Energy Biosciences Institute; Amazon AWS education grant; USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1114804]; Northeastern States Research Cooperative; DOE NICCRUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-06ER64157]; NSF (DIBBS)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1261582]","Istem Fer was funded by grants to Michael C.

However, the effects of climate change forecasts on biotic interactions remain poorly studied. In cactus species, pollination constitutes a fundamental process in the production of fruits and seeds. Thus, we aimed to analyse the impact of future climate change on the geographical distributions of 11 cactus species from the southern Central Andes and their spatial match with their pollinators. We used species distribution modelling to forecast the geographic range shifts of these cactus species and their pollinators under two future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for the years 2050 and 2070. We predicted geographic range contractions under future scenarios that reached almost 80% for some cactus species. Our results indicate that the geographical distributions of cacti would be constrained by the presence of the pollinator species on which they depend in the present; however, climate change would not cause spatial mismatch between cacti and their animal pollinators in the future. For most cactus species, we predicted an increase in the spatial match with their mutualists under future scenarios. This is the first study that estimates the geographic range of cacti using both abiotic and biotic factors.

We review recent work that quantifies variation in high temperature tolerance across bioclimatic gradients, and we explore the implications for vulnerability to climate change. For some sources of variation, including differences in the evolutionary potential of heat tolerance across latitude, the typical biogeographic pattern of high vulnerability in the tropics is exacerbated. For other sources of variation, including certain types of plastic variation in heat tolerance, the biogeographic pattern of high tropical vulnerability is diminished.

Along elevation gradients, a trade-off between species tolerance to cold climates and metabolic rates dictates that cold adapted organisms display a lower efficiency in decomposition, growth or herbivory. As a consequence, if dispersal or evolution under climate change is systematically faster for agents of one compartment (e.g. insect herbivores, or soil microbes, respectively) compared to others, novel and more efficient functions will arise in the alpine systems and increase fluxes of elements to and through this compartment. We illustrate this potential decoupling using a mechanistic model, where the efficiency of agents in the compartments follows the metabolic theory. To detect and forecast ecosystem decoupling under climate change, we argue that the current efficiency of agents should be measured systematically along elevation gradients.

The full extent of Australia's temperate coastline. MethodsWe assessed relationships between climatic and non-climatic environmental data known to influence seaweed, and the presence of 15 habitat-forming seaweeds. Distributional data (herbarium records) were analysed with MAXENT and generalized linear and additive models, to construct species distribution models at 0.2 degrees spatial resolution, and project possible distribution shifts under the RCP 6.0 (medium) and 2.6 (conservative) emissions scenarios of ocean warming for 2100. ResultsSummer temperatures, and to a lesser extent winter temperatures, were the strongest distribution predictors for temperate habitat-forming seaweeds in Australia. Projections for 2100 predicted major poleward shifts for 13 of the 15 species, on average losing 78% (range: 36%-100%) of their current distributions under RCP 6.0 and 62% (range: 27%-100%) under RCP 2.6. The giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and three prominent fucoids (Durvillaea potatorum, Xiphophora chondrophylla and Phyllospora comosa) were predicted to become extinct from Australia under RCP 6.0. Many species currently distributed up the west and east coasts, including the dominant kelp Ecklonia radiata (71% and 49% estimated loss for RPC 6.0 and 2.6, respectively), were predicted to become restricted to the south coast. Main conclusionsIn close accordance with emerging observations in Australia and globally, our study predicted major range contractions of temperate seaweeds in coming decades.

We tested the effect on species habitat suitabilities of alternative climate change scenarios and varying amounts of forest set-aside from production over the coming century. ResultsWith 3.6% of forest area set-aside from production and assuming no climate change, overall habitat suitabilities for all six species were projected to increase in response to maturing spruce in set-aside forest. However, overall habitat suitabilities for all six species were projected to decline under climate change scenario RCP4.5 (intermediate-low emissions), with even greater declines projected under RCP 8.5 (high emissions). Increasing the amount of forest set-aside to 16% resulted in significant increases in overall habitat suitability, with one species showing an increase. A further increase to 32% forest set-aside resulted in considerably more positive trends, with three of six species increasing. Main conclusionsThere is interspecific variation in the importance of future macroclimate and resource availability on species occurrence.

However, modelling -diversity is challenging, especially for multiple diversity facets (i.e., taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity), and current methods have important limitations. Here, we present a new approach for predicting the response of multifaceted -diversity to the environment, called Multifaceted Biodiversity Modelling (MBM). We illustrate the approach using both a plant diversity dataset from the French Alps and a set of simulated data. We also provide an implementation via an R package. LocationFrench Alps. MethodsFor both the French Alps and the simulated communities, we compute -diversity indices (e.g., SOrensen dissimilarity, mean functional/phylogenetic pairwise distance) among site pairs. We then apply Gaussian process regression, a flexible nonlinear modelling technique, to predict -diversity in response to environmental distance among site pairs. For comparison, we also perform similar analyses using Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM), a well-established method for modelling -diversity in response to environmental distance. ResultsIn the Alps, we observed a general increase in taxonomic (TD) and functional (FD) -diversity (i.e., site pairs were more different from each other) as the climatic distance between site pairs increased. GDM performed better for TD and FD when fitting to calibration data, whereas MBM performed better for both when predicting to a validation dataset.

However, results from experiments often are inconsistent with observations made under natural conditions, suggesting the need for rigorous comparisons of experimental and observational studies. We conducted such a reality check for a grassland ecosystem by compiling results from nine independently conducted climate change experiments. Each experiment manipulated growing season precipitation (GSP) and measured responses in aboveground net primary production (ANPP). We compared results from experiments with long-term (33-yr) annual precipitation and ANPP records to ask if collectively (n=44 experiment-years) experiments yielded estimates of ANPP, rain-use efficiency (RUE, grams per square meter ANPP per mm precipitation), and the relationship between GSP and ANPP comparable to observations. We found that mean ANPP and RUE from experiments did not deviate from observations. Experiments and observational data also yielded similar functional relationships between ANPP and GSP, but only within the range of historically observed GSP. Fewer experiments imposed extreme levels of GSP (outside the observed 33-yr record), but when these were included, they altered the GSP-ANPP relationship. This result underscores the need for more experiments imposing extreme precipitation levels to resolve how forecast changes in climate regimes will affect ecosystem function in the future.",,,,"Slette, Ingrid/AAL-8634-2020; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008","Slette, Ingrid/0000-0002-7707-3246; Felton, Andrew/0000-0002-1533-6071",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Support was provided by US National Science Foundation funded projects: The Konza Prairie LTER program, The Extreme Drought in Grasslands (EDGE) and Integrating NEON ANPP Data with Existing Long-term Data projects (Macrosystems Biology), Drought-Net (a Research Coordination Network), and The RaMPs project (Ecosystem Science, LTREB).",,,9,10,5,56,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2018,99,10,,,,,2145,2151,,10.1002/ecy.2474,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000446270400002,30054917,,,,

Here we present a framework that links productivity dynamics and ecosystem state transitions based on a spatially continuous dataset of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) from the temperate grassland of China. Across a regional precipitation gradient, we quantified spatial patterns in ANPP dynamics (variability, asymmetry and sensitivity to rainfall) and related these to transitions from desert to semi-arid to mesic steppe. We show that these three indices of ANPP dynamics displayed distinct spatial patterns, with peaks signalling transitions between grassland types.

However, most studies of shrub expansion have focused on dryland ecosystems (e.g., savannas, rangelands, grasslands), or in tundra regions (e.g., arctic, alpine). However, shrubs play a key role in other systems, such as the understory of temperate forests. In the Appalachian forests of the eastern United States, rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is the most prevalent species constituent of the understory evergreen shrub community and can affect forest diversity and structure by altering light and moisture regimes, and changing soil chemical and physical properties. We examine the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of the evergreen shrub layer within a mid-Appalachian forest over the period from 1986 to 2011 using Landsat TM data to explore how shrub expansion is related to landscape position (e.g., elevation, aspect, and distance-to-stream). We use a combination of remotely sensed vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, tasseled cap indices) derived from snow-free, leaf-off Landsat 5 surface reflectance data from 1986 to 2011 paired with a Random Forest classification model to examine shrub dynamics in the Weimer Run watershed near Canaan Valley, West Virginia, a first-order, high-altitude watershed. We show extensive increases in winter greenness we attribute to expansion of the evergreen shrub community. From 1986 to 2011, there is a 0.14 increase in winter NDVI, with a 52% relative increase in shrub coverage over 25 yr. Shrub expansion is most notable at lower elevations, along streams, and on southerly oriented slopes. We argue that changes in shrub abundance are due to decreased moisture limitations driven by changing climate. There is an increased effort to reintroduce native conifers to this region, but changes in the shrub community jeopardize this effort, as rhododendron inhibits the growth and dispersal of these conifers (e.g., red spruce). Our results show that rhododendron shrubs are expanding into areas of the forest from which they have previously been restricted. Use of these remote sensing methods may allow better habitat suitability mapping, leading to better targeted restoration efforts and more-informed ecosystem forecasts.",,,,,,Canaan Valley Institute; University of Virginia Department of Environmental Sciences,"We would like to thank Margaret Seibers, JC Neblett, Jon Walter, and JJ Frost for their input and contributions to this study.

High mountain lakes are a network of sentinels, sensitive to any events occurring within their waterbodies, their surrounding catchments and their airsheds. By modifying nutrient balance and availability in water, both local and global changes are expected to alter primary productivity and to trigger strong ecological impacts in these ecosystems. 2. Predicting ecological trajectories under future change is a key challenge for both scientists and conservation managers. French alpine lakes, in the most southern and western part of the European Alps, have received surprisingly little attention to date. In this article, we address how variations in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply are likely to impact the area's phytoplankton growth. We performed N and/or P enrichment microcosm experiments under controlled conditions on 12 phytoplankton assemblages sampled during the summer 2016 in four French alpine lakes with contrasting catchments and N-deposition regimes. 3. The nutrients limiting phytoplankton growth varied according to the nutrient stoichiometry of the lake water. In the lakes exposed to high N-deposition rates 0700 kg N km(2) year 1 ), the water contained more N than P and phytoplankton growth in microcosms was either limited by P or not limited by either N or P. In the lakes exposed to low N-deposition rates 0500 kg N km(2) year 1 ), N availability relative to P was lower in the lake with vegetated catchment than in the lake with rocky catchment, resulting in a switch from P to NP colimitation of the phytoplankton in microcosms. 4. Our data clearly indicate that French alpine lakes do not host the same diversity and structure of phytoplankton communities and that phytoplankton composition influenced phytoplankton growth in microcosms. First, we show that nonmotile colonial chlorophytes appeared in late summer assemblages, with lower growth rates but P-storage abilities. Second, our findings indicate that the growth of phytoplankton assemblages dominated by diatoms was increasingly limited by silica (SiO2) throughout the summer, along with a 70% decrease in SiO2 concentration in lake water. 5. The forecast global changes in the French Alps should increase phytoplankton growth in most high mountain lakes where P is the main limiting nutrient, before NP colimitation. These changes are likely to be of lesser extent in lakes with large vegetated catchments in the northern area with lower N-deposition rates and of greater extent in the southern area with higher N-deposition rates and future P-deposition rates. 6. By investigating the relationship between nutrient availability, phytoplankton composition and phytoplankton growth rate, this experimental laboratory microcosm study will help interpret current multifactorial data from in situ monitoring networks in the Alps. It will also be helpful to develop models to better predict the sentinel lake responses to local and global changes.",,,,,"Jacquemin, Coralie/0000-0001-9778-6879",French National Agency for Biodiversity,French National Agency for Biodiversity,,,2,2,1,15,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Under the worst-case scenario, Posidonia oceanica might lose 75% of suitable habitat by 2050 and is at risk of functional extinction by 2100, whereas Cymodocea nodosa would lose only 46.5% in that scenario as losses are compensated with gained and stable areas in the Atlantic. Besides, we predict that erosion of present genetic diversity and vicariant processes can happen, as all Mediterranean genetic regions could decrease considerably in extension in future warming scenarios.

We explored the properties of different plant niches in a biodiversity hotspot, over a wide span of elevational and latitudinal ranges, to assess the relationship between niche characteristics and the modelled distributional shifts due to climate change. Location Methods We assessed the niche breadth and position of 118 plant species of South American temperate forests, using an Outlying Mean Index (OMI). Bioclimatic information was gathered for each species from WorldClim, and both present and future distributions were modelled using BIOMOD, considering migration constraints with MIGCLIM. The relationships between niche properties and shifts in elevational and latitudinal distributions were explored using linear regressions. Results South American temperate forests. Main conclusions Niche differences among species were related to two bioclimatic dimensions: the first one correlated with the mean diurnal temperature range and precipitation seasonality following the mediterranean-temperate-sub-Antarctic climatic gradient; the second one correlated with minimum winter temperature along a gradient from oceanic-influenced habitats to cold tree line habitats. The projected elevational shifts were inversely related to niche breadth and the forecast latitudinal shifts were directly related to niche breadth. The shifts in elevation and latitude for understorey plants were not consistent with the shifts of dominant trees. The plant niches were successfully discerned by OMI analyses and they were associated with specific morphological or physiological traits. South American temperate forest plants showed an inverse relationship between niche breadth and elevational shifts, but a positive relationship regarding expected latitudinal shifts. This may be related to the fact that niche drivers followed a latitudinal orientation and the species showed the Rapoport's effect. Thus, the niche breadth and latitudinal position of the species should be considered in climatic change studies.",,,,"Alarcon, Diego/I-1990-2016","Alarcon, Diego/0000-0003-3751-047X",Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (IEB) [PFB-023 CONICYT]; Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research,"Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (IEB, http://www.ieb-chile.cl), Grant/Award Number: PFB-023 CONICYT; Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (http://www.conicyt.cl), Grant/Award Number: Doctoral grant",,,3,3,5,40,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

These types can be grouped into series representing dry-to-wet conditions for tropical and temperate vegetation. Methods We used climate exposure analysis to compare current and future climate parameters for the major vegetation types of Oaxaca. This technique integrates a recent vegetation map with historical climate data (1981-2010) to produce a baseline climate layer that is compared to climate projections made with five different global circulation models for near-future (2015-2039) and end-century (2075-2099) periods using two emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). We classified the frequency distribution of the baseline climate into five exposure classes where the closer values are to mean climate conditions, the lower the exposure. Future exposure was estimated by classifying the vegetation pixels into the same exposure classes, now based on future climate values. Increased exposure risk was assessed based on the fraction of pixels that moved into higher exposure classes from one period to another. Results and main conclusions Our analysis showed four general trends: (a) the higher, current track emissions scenario produced much larger end-century climate exposure; (b) for the tropical vegetation series, tropical evergreen forests are projected as most exposed by end-century; (c) for the temperate vegetation series the matorral-shrubland and conifer forests are the most impacted; and (d) the five GCMs considered showed some convergence in their end-century climate exposure predictions, with coastal and low-elevation areas of the State projected to experience the greatest exposure, and the interior mountain slopes and central region projected to experience the least exposure and be the most climatically stable.",,,,"Schwartz, Mark/G-1066-2011","Schwartz, Mark/0000-0002-3739-6542; Choe, Hyeyeong/0000-0003-2130-1622; Thorne, James/0000-0002-9130-9921; Rivera Garcia, Raul/0000-0002-1622-8160",University of California Institute for Mexico; University of California Institute for United States,University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States,,,1,1,2,7,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Understanding the combined effects of stressors on process rates mediated by individuals in ecosystems would greatly improve our ability to predict organismal multifunctionality (e.g. multiple consumer-mediated functions). We conducted a laboratory experiment to test direct and indirect, as well as immediate and delayed effects of a heat wave (pulsed stress) and micropollutants (MPs) (prolonged stress) on individual consumers (the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) and their multifunctionality (i.e. consumption of basal resources, growth, reproduction, nutrient excretion and organic-matter cycling). We found that stressful conditions increased the process rates of multiple functions mediated by individual consumers. Specifically, the artificial heat wave increased process rates in the majority of the quantified functions (either directly or indirectly), whereas exposure to MPs increased consumption of basal resources which led to increases in the release of nutrients and fine particulate organic matter. Moreover, snails exposed to a heat wave showed decreased reproduction and nutrient excretion after the heat-wave, indicating the potential for ecologically relevant delayed effects. Our study indicates that the immediate and delayed effects of stressors on individual organisms may directly and indirectly impact multiple ecosystem functions. In particular, delayed effects of environmental stress on individual consumers may cumulatively impede recovery due to decreased functioning following a perturbation.

The capacity of vegetation to use soil water depends on its root distribution (RD). However, RD is extremely variable in space and difficult to measure in the field, which hinders accurate predictions of water fluxes and vegetation dynamics. We propose a new method to estimate RD within water balance models, assuming that vegetation is at eco-hydrological equilibrium (EHE). EHE conditions imply that vegetation optimizes RD such that transpiration is maximized within the limits of bearable drought stress, characterized here by species-specific hydraulic thresholds. Optimized RD estimates were validated against RD estimates obtained by model calibration from sap flow or soil moisture from 38 forest plots in Catalonia (NE Spain). In water-limited plots, optimized RD was similar to calibrated RD, but estimates diverged with higher water availability, suggesting that the EHE may not be assumed when water is not limiting. Thereafter, we applied the optimization procedure at the regional scale, to estimate RD for the water-limited forests of Catalonia. Regional variations of optimum RD reproduced many expected patterns in response to climate, soil physical properties, forest structure, and species hydraulic traits. We conclude that RD optimization, based on the EHE hypothesis and a simple description of plant hydraulics, produces realistic estimates of RD that can be used for model parameterization and shows promise to improve our ability to forecast vegetation dynamics under increased drought.",,,,"De Caceres, Miquel/I-1279-2016; Poyatos, Rafael/F-8305-2010; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; de Aragon, Juan Martinez/K-2631-2014; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/D-3385-2014","De Caceres, Miquel/0000-0001-7132-2080; Poyatos, Rafael/0000-0003-0521-2523; de Aragon, Juan Martinez/0000-0001-5663-2080; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/0000-0002-2332-7298; Cabon, Antoine/0000-0001-6426-1726","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2015-66001-C3-1-R, BES-2015-071350, CGL2013-46808-R, CGL2014-5583-JIN, CGL2014-59742-C2-2-R, RYC-2012-11109]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Numbers: AGL2015-66001-C3-1-R, BES-2015-071350, CGL2013-46808-R, CGL2014-5583-JIN, CGL2014-59742-C2-2-R and RYC-2012-11109",,,5,5,2,25,,,,1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,OCT,2018,11,7,,,,,,,UNSP e2015,10.1002/eco.2015,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,,,WOS:000446431200030,,,,,

Most studies focus on changes in species ranges or plastic responses like phenology, but adaptive evolution could be equally important. Studying evolutionary responses is challenging given limited historical data and a poor understanding of genetically variable traits under selection. We take advantage of a historical dataset to test for an adaptive response to climate change in a widespread, polymorphic amphibian, the eastern red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus. We resurveyed color morph frequencies across New England to test for an adaptive shift in response to climate change. We modeled historical and present-day morph proportions as a function of climate and tested the accuracy of predictions both within and across different time periods. Our models showed moderate accuracy when predicting morph frequencies within time periods, but poor accuracy across time periods. Despite substantial changes in climate and significant relationships between morph frequency and climate variables within periods, we found no evidence for the predicted shift in morph frequencies across New England. The relationship between climate and color morph frequencies is likely more complex than originally suggested, potentially involving the interplay of additional factors such as microclimate variation, land use changes, and frequency-dependent selection. Model extrapolation and changes in the correlation structure of climate variables also likely contributed to poor predictive ability. Evolution could provide a means to moderate the effects of climate change on many species. However, we often do not understand the direct links between climate variation, traits, and fitness. Therefore, forecasting climate-mediated evolution remains an ongoing and important challenge for understanding climate change threats to species.",,,,"Urban, Mark/Y-2430-2019",,"American Museum of Natural History (Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Fund grant); UConn EEB Zoology Grant; Duke Univ.

However, not much is known about how these factors are perceived, and whether people's perceptions match realities. We surveyed 307 people involved in the restoration of native vegetation across Australia to identify their perceptions on the factors influencing the success of restoration projects. We found that weather (particularly drought and flooding) has realized impacts on the success of restoration projects, but is not perceived to be an important risk when planning new projects. This highlights the need for better recognition and management of weather risk in restoration and a potential role of seasonal forecasting. We used restoration case studies across Australia to assess the ability of seasonal forecasts provided by the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia, version M24 (POAMA-2) to detect unfavorable weather with sufficient skill and lead time to be useful for restoration projects. We found that rainfall and temperature variables in POAMA-2 predicted 88% of the weather issues encountered in restoration case studies apart from strong winds and cyclones. Of those restoration case studies with predictable weather issues, POAMA-2 had the forecast skill to predict the dominant or first-encountered issue in 67% of cases. We explored the challenges associated with uptake of forecast products through consultation with restoration practitioners and developed a prototype forecast product using a local case study. Integrating seasonal forecasting into decision making through (1) identifying risk management strategies during restoration planning, (2) accessing the forecast a month prior to revegetation activities, and (3) adapting decisions if extreme weather is forecasted, is expected to improve the establishment success of restoration.",,,,"Wilson, Kerrie/W-4181-2019; Wilson, Kerrie A/C-8058-2009; Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; Shoo, Luke P/A-2715-2009","Wilson, Kerrie/0000-0002-0092-935X; Wilson, Kerrie A/0000-0002-0092-935X; Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; Hagger, Valerie/0000-0001-8408-8449",CSIROCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian Government's Linkage Programme,"We acknowledge all the individuals that participated in the survey and A.

For alpine lakes, which are exposed to both exacerbated atmospheric warming and intense episodic weather events, future conditions might not be appropriately forecast by only climate change trends, i.e. warming, if extreme events have the potential to deflect their thermal and metabolic states from their seasonal ranges. We used high-frequency monitoring data over three open-water seasons with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the high-altitude Lake Muzelle (France) to show that rainstorms or windstorms, notwithstanding their intensity, did not trigger long-lasting consequences to the lake characteristics when light penetration into the lake was not modified. In contrast, storms associated with high turbidity input from the watershed (turbid storms) strongly modified the lacustrine hydrodynamics and metabolism for the rest of the open-water season through reduced light penetration. The long-lasting effects of turbid storms were related to the inputs and in-lake persistence of very light glacial suspensoids from the watershed. The occurrence of the observed turbid storms was not related to the wind or rain intensities during the events. Instead, the turbid storms occurred after dry and atypically warm spells, i.e. meteorological conditions expected to be more frequent in this alpine region in the upcoming decades. Consequently, storm events, notwithstanding their intensity, are expected to strongly imprint the future ecological status of alpine lakes under climate warming.",,,,,"Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Bruel, Rosalie/0000-0001-8351-7539",SOERE OLA for the monitoring program; USMB; EDF-Segula,SOERE OLA for the monitoring program; USMB funding to RB; EDF-Segula funding to YG,,,7,7,5,21,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

While climate changes have been widely used in systematic conservation planning (SCP), biological invasions are rarely considered. Here, we combine the effects of climate changes and Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) invasion on the SCP for endemic aromatic fruit tree species from the Atlantic Forest (EFAF). We tested the effect of invasion on SCP measures of species turnover, biotic stability, and irreplaceability. Ecological niche models were used to establish species environmental suitability for the preindustrial period for both invasive species and EFAF and to forecast to the end of the century (2080-2100). We calculated the niche overlap between the invasive species and EFAF and tested the overlap significance using a null model. We tested the biological invasion effect on the results using results with no species invasion correction. The niche overlap between A. heterophyllus and EFAF was significant for 50% of species in the preindustrial period and for 33% in the future. The spatial patterns of species turnover, biotic stability, and irreplaceability had significant effects on biological invasion changing the spatial pattern in both shape and magnitude, which can misplace and overvalue conservation priorities. We showed that the disregard of biological invasion on SCP can cause negative effects on SCP under climate change.

Yet our ability to measure, monitor and forecast biodiversity change - crucial to addressing it - remains limited. Biodiversity monitoring systems are being developed to improve this capacity by deriving metrics of change from an array of insitu data (e.g. field plots or species occurrence records) and Earth observations (EO; e.g. satellite or airborne imagery). However, there are few ecologically based frameworks for integrating these data into meaningful metrics of biodiversity change. Here, I describe how concepts of pattern and scale in ecology could be used to design such a framework. I review three core topics: the role of scale in measuring and modelling biodiversity patterns with EO, scale-dependent challenges linking insitu and EO data and opportunities to apply concepts of pattern and scale to EO to improve biodiversity mapping. From this analysis emerges an actionable approach for measuring, monitoring and forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting key opportunities to establish EO as the backbone of global-scale, science-driven conservation.",,,,,"Anderson, Christopher/0000-0001-7392-4368",Bing-Mooney Fellowship in Environmental Science and Conservation at Stanford University's Department of Biology,"This work was supported by the Bing-Mooney Fellowship in Environmental Science and Conservation at Stanford University's Department of Biology.

Ecosystem impacts of woody mortality depend on both the number and sizes of trees that die, but a limited capacity to predict mortality risk for individual trees hinders the capacity to forecast drought effects on tree population demography and ecosystem processes. We remotely measured leaf area of living Ashe juniper trees at three savanna sites in central Texas, USA to characterize the frequency-size distribution (FSD) of juniper populations and evaluate mortality risk from drought as a function of tree size. Mortality risk of individuals was assessed from the deviation in leaf area per tree from that of a similarly sized individual with near maximal leaf area using correlations among leaf area, growth rate, and mortality measured during a prior drought. We found that the FSD of juniper trees is bell-shaped at each site. Mortality risk from drought exceeded 25% of emergent (>4m height) trees in savanna juniper populations, but was highest for largest trees. Mortality risk was greatest at a grazed savanna, exceeding 50% of trees with projected canopy area >20m(2). Results imply that severe drought could kill a large fraction (18-85%) of intermediate- to large-sized Ashe juniper trees in central Texas savannas.

Several research studies delineated advantages of Mesonet weather information for efficient agricultural decision-making. However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center. The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006-2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006-2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.

Based on climate models, a multitude of studies project that certain species will not be able to migrate fast enough to keep up with changing environmental conditions, presenting a greater risk of their possible extinction. However, many of these studies are based on correlative climate niche models that represent the current living conditions of species and may not consider their ability to tolerate projected changes in future climate, including the stimulative effects of rising CO2 for plant growth and drought tolerance. SDMs also are not usually run with sufficiently detailed spatial data to account for refugia. These and other aspects of model-based niche studies can potentially combine to mischaracterize the risk to species due to climate change. Even a SDM that perfectly predicts future equilibrium geographic range following climate change, however, does not yield a direct estimate of extinction risk. The key question is ""What is the transient response to a climate disequilibrium situation?"" The concept of relaxation is introduced to evaluate time-scales for responses at the trailing edge of species' ranges. Simulation of relaxation at a forest ecotone shows the relaxation response in some cases can be hundreds of years.

Increasingly, public databases of species observation records are being used to quantify changes in NAS distributions across space and time, and are becoming an important resource for researchers, managers, and policy-makers. Here we use publicly available data to describe trends in NAS introduction and spread across the conterminous United States over more than two centuries of observation records. Available data on first records of NAS reveal significant shifts in dominance of particular introduction patterns over time, both in terms of recipient regions and likely sources. These spatiotemporal trends at the continental scale may be subject to biases associated with regional variation in sampling effort, reporting, and data curation. We therefore also examined two additional metrics, the number of individual records and the spatial coverage of those records, which are likely to be more closely associated with sampling effort. Our results suggest that broad-scale patterns may mask considerable variation across regions, time periods, and even entities contributing to NAS sampling. In some cases, observed temporal shifts in species discovery may be influenced by dramatic fluctuations in the number and spatial extent of individual observations, reflecting the possibility that shifts in sampling effort may obscure underlying rates of NAS introduction.",,,,"Neilson, Matthew/B-4501-2009","Neilson, Matthew/0000-0002-5139-5677; Davis, Amy/0000-0001-6178-1734","United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through Office of Research and Development","The authors wish to thank A.

Of the approximately 1150 bat species (Chiroptera) recognized by the IUCN, 17 percent are categorized as Data Deficient. Here, we show that large trait databases in combination with a comprehensive phylogeny can identify which traits are important for assessing extinction risk in bats. Using phylogenetic logistic regressions, we show that geographic range and island endemism are the strongest correlates of binary extinction risk. We also show that simulations using two models that trade-off between data complexity and data coverage provide similar estimates of extinction risk for species that have received a Red List assessment. We then use our model parameters to provide quantitative predictions of extinction risk for 60 species that have not received risk assessments by the IUCN.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report, we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a data set of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural network-based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource.

This is particularly true when the scale of the disturbance no longer matches the regeneration strategy of the dominant vegetation. In the yellow pine and mixed conifer forests of California, over a century of fire exclusion and the warming climate are increasing the incidence and extent of stand-replacing wildfire; such changes in severity patterns are altering regeneration dynamics by dramatically increasing the distance from live tree seed sources. This has raised concerns about limitations to natural reforestation and the potential for conversion to non-forested vegetation types, which in turn has implications for shifts in many ecological processes and ecosystem services. We used a California region-wide data set with 1,848 plots across 24 wildfires in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests to build a spatially explicit habitat suitability model for forecasting postfire forest regeneration. To model the effect of seed availability, the critical initial biological filter for regeneration, we used a novel approach to predicting spatial patterns of seed availability by estimating annual seed production from existing basal area and burn severity maps. The probability of observing any conifer seedling in a 60-m(2) area (the field plot scale) was highly dependent on 30-yr average annual precipitation, burn severity, and seed availability. We then used this model to predict regeneration probabilities across the entire extent of a new fire (the 2014 King Fire), which highlights the spatial variability inherent in postfire regeneration patterns. Such forecasts of postfire regeneration patterns are of importance to land managers and conservationists interested in maintaining forest cover on the landscape. Our tool can also help anticipate shifts in ecosystem properties, supporting researchers interested in investigating questions surrounding alternative stable states, and the interaction of altered disturbance regimes and the changing climate.",,,,"O'Hara, Kevin/AAH-6002-2020","O'Hara, Kevin/0000-0002-3800-9188","USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest RegionUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; University of California, BerkeleyUniversity of California System","This work was funded by a cost-share agreement between the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region and the University of California, Berkeley.

The aim of this study was to investigate how such flow alterations affect bio-geomorphological processes and habitat suitability of several fluvial plant and animal species. This is done with a numerical model representing dynamic interactions between morphodynamic processes and riparian vegetation coupled to habitat suitability models of fluvial species. We compared a control run with natural flow regime to altered flow for two scenarios with different dam operating regimes, two scenarios with climate change, and for combinations of dams and climate change. Results show that flow stabilization leads to incision, acute reduced seedling recruitment and decline of riparian vegetation. Climate change generates a gradual response, where high flow extremes counteract an otherwise reduced seedling recruitment of pioneer vegetation, while drying reduces riparian vegetation recruitment and causes vegetation shifts towards lower elevations on the floodplain. Modelled habitat availability for facilitated plant and animal species declines most when the synchronicity between critical life history events and habitat requirements is disrupted by altered flow conditions, with opposite effects for different species. Dynamic interactions between bio-geo-morphological processes with somewhat different characteristic timescales create non-linear and adaptive behaviour of morphology, habitat patterns and facilitated species habitat. This implies that only models that include bio-geo-morphological feedbacks can forecast impacts of multiple flow alteration pressures, whereas addition of single-pressure regime effects is overly simplistic.",,,,,,REFORM (FP7 Grant) [282656],"We kindly thank Dr. Gerben van Geest (Deltares) for contributing to the dose-effect relations of macrophytes and helophytes.

We outline a Bayesian approach to separate the probability of species co-occurrence, interaction and detectability in influencing interaction betadiversity. We use a multi-year hummingbird-plant time series, divided into training and testing data, to show that including models of detectability and occurrence improves forecasts of mutualistic interactions. We then extend our model to explore interaction betadiversity across two distinct seasons. Despite differences in the observed interactions among seasons, there was no significant change in hummingbird occurrence or interaction frequency between hummingbirds and plants. These results highlight the challenge of inferring the causes of interaction betadiversity when interaction detectability is low. Finally, we highlight potential applications of our model for integrating observations of local interactions with biogeographic and evolutionary histories of co-occurring species.

However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. ApproachFindingsWe present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species' co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusionsMoving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.",,,,"Lischke, Heike/J-5719-2013; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Schmidt, Susanne/Q-1657-2015; Pinkert, Stefan/J-3602-2019; Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Schmidt, Susanne/0000-0003-0051-6480; Pinkert, Stefan/0000-0002-8348-2337; Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Pagel, Jorn/0000-0002-4817-1920; Moretti, Marco/0000-0002-5845-3198; Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794; Steinbauer, Manuel/0000-0002-7142-9272","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DO786/10-1, SH 924/1-1, DE 2754/1-1]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie action [700796, 707491]; Danish Carlsbergfondet [CF14-0148]; Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Weiterbildung und Kultur Rheinland-Pfalz","German Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DO786/10-1, SH 924/1-1 and DE 2754/1-1; Marie Sklodowska-Curie action, Grant/Award Number: 700796 and 707491; Danish Carlsbergfondet, Grant/Award Number: CF14-0148; Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Weiterbildung und Kultur Rheinland-Pfalz",,,23,23,9,33,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Invasive tree pests are increasingly threatening forest ecosystems. Understanding and controlling their spread presents a major challenge for managers, researchers, and policy makers. In 1999, the pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, causal agent of pine wilt disease and native to North America, was first detected in Europe, more precisely in south-western Portugal. Since then, it has spread to more than 30% of the country, producing large-scale damages in Portuguese forests. 2. We applied a new spatio-temporal network-based model to predict, at yearly intervals, the natural spread of the PWN on the Iberian Peninsula, as dispersed by the longhorn beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis, its only known vector in Europe. We compared the model predictions with independent observations of the natural spread of pine wilt disease in Portugal between 2005 and 2015. We simulated the effect of potential containment measures on the disease spread. 3. The model predicted the status (infected or non-infected) of forest areas with 93% accuracy, had 93% sensitivity and specificity, and AUC=0.96 (averages for 8 years with validation data). 4. Simulated clear-cut belts stopped the spread only if they were wider than 30 km, although thinner belts delayed invasion. Furthermore, clear-cuts were much more effective in slowing down the invasion when reinforced, in the adjacent areas, by the reduction in the vector beetle population through mass trapping and by the early detection and removal of infected trees. 5. Model projections identified areas through which the nematode is most likely to invade, by natural means, the phytosanitary buffer zone established along the Portuguese border, and Spain. 6. Synthesis and applications. In the absence of effective containment measures, the pine wood nematode may naturally spread into Spain in about 5 years. In less than 10 years, it may reach the major forest and climatic corridors that provide a gateway for subsequent expansion towards the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and, in the longer term, towards other European countries. Our model can considerably support management efforts by forecasting when areas are at highest risk of vector-mediated invasion as well as the effects of specific control measures on the disease spread.",,,,"Saura, Santiago/A-9994-2008","Saura, Santiago/0000-0002-5239-0763",,,,,13,13,7,45,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Most naturalised and invasive alien plant species were originally introduced to regions for horticultural purposes. However, many regions now face an invasion debt from ornamental alien species, which have not yet naturalised. In this regard, climate change represents a threat as it may lower the barriers to naturalisation for some ornamental alien species. Identifying those species is extremely important for anticipating impending invasions. 2. To identify predictors of naturalisation, we modelled the effects of climate, nursery availability and species characteristics on the current European naturalisation success of 2,073 ornamental aliens commonly planted in European gardens. We then used the resulting model together with climate projections for 2050 to forecast future naturalisation risks for the 1,583 species not yet naturalised in Europe. 3. We found that non-European naturalised range size, climatic suitability, propagule pressure, having a dioecious sexual system and plant height jointly explained current naturalisation success in Europe. By 2050, naturalisation probability projections increased by more than 0.1 for 41 species, and only decreased by more than 0.1 for one species. 4. Policy implications. Using predictions based on our integrated model of alien ornamental naturalisation success, we identified species with high future naturalisation risk and species with high projected increases in naturalisation potential in Europe under climate change. This species list allows for prioritisation of monitoring and regulation of ornamental plants to mitigate the invasion debt.",,,,"Pysek, Petr/B-1957-2012; Roquet, Cristina/AAB-4031-2019; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012; Kreft, Holger/A-4736-2008; Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Pergl, Jan/H-1071-2011; Weigelt, Patrick/E-2122-2014","Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758; Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Pergl, Jan/0000-0002-0045-1974; Weigelt, Patrick/0000-0002-2485-3708; Van der Veken, Sebastiaan/0000-0001-8897-4464; Roquet, Cristina/0000-0001-8748-3743; van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Dullinger, Iwona/0000-0002-2692-2973",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KL 1866/6-1]; Biodiversa [BiodivERsA2013-99]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR); DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG); FWFAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Centre of Excellence PLADIAS [14-15414S]; RVO [67985939]; NAKI II project [DG16P02M041],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: KL 1866/6-1; Biodiversa, Grant/Award Number: BiodivERsA2013-99; ANR; DFG; FWF; Centre of Excellence PLADIAS, Grant/Award Number: 14-15414S; RVO, Grant/Award Number: 67985939; NAKI II project, Grant/Award Number: DG16P02M041",,,7,8,12,46,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Two factors that may cause variation in range shifts across species are dispersal ability and varying rates of climate change through time and across space. Here, we assess patterns of range shifts during the late Quaternary and estimate how the velocity of climate change and the dispersal ability of a species affect the magnitude of species range shifts in response to climate change. Location: North America. Methods: We hindcast species distribution models for 122 North American mammals to five times over the past 17,000 years and forecast them to two future times given two emissions scenarios. Generalized additive models were constructed to quantify the importance of dispersal ability and the velocity of temperature and precipitation in determining the magnitude of range shift expected for individual species. Results: Hindcasted and forecasted ranges demonstrate the variety of responses to climate change. In general, species shifted their ranges in a northerly direction (NW, N, NE) regardless of the type of climate change (i.e., warming vs. cooling). The highest rates of range shifts during the past occurred during periods of relatively rapid climate change (Last Glacial Maximum/Bolling-Allerod and Bolling-Allerod/Younger Dryas transitions). Rates of range shifts for the future are projected to be significantly higher than any of the past intervals. The velocity of climate change is significantly associated with the magnitude of range shifts during climate transitions that occur over longer time-scales, while maximum dispersal distance is important during periods of rapid climate change. Main Conclusions: Our results suggest that both the dispersal ability and the velocity of climate change are significantly associated with species' range shifts.

Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are an increasingly popular technique to infer interaction strengths between species in a community and to predict the community response to environmental change. The most commonly employed MAR(1) models, with one time lag, can be viewed either as multispecies competition models with Gompertz density dependence or, more generally, as a linear approximation of more complex, nonlinear dynamics around stable equilibria. This latter interpretation allows for broader applicability, but may come at a cost in terms of interpretation of estimates and reliability of both short- and long-term predictions. 2. We investigate what these costs might be by fitting MAR(1) models to simulated 2-species competition, consumer-resource and host-parasitoid systems, as well as a larger food web influenced by the environment. We review how MAR(1) coefficients can be interpreted and evaluate how reliable are estimates of interaction strength, rank, or sign; accuracy of short-term forecasts; as well as the ability of MAR(1) models to predict the long-term responses of communities submitted to environmental change such as PRESS perturbations. 3. The net effects of species j on species i are usually (90%-95%) well recovered in terms of sign or rank, with the notable exception of overcompensatory dynamics. In actual values, net effects of species j on species i are not well recovered when the underlying dynamics are nonlinear. MAR(1) models are better at making short-term qualitative forecasts (next point going up or down) than at predicting long-term responses to environmental perturbations, which can be severely over- as well as underestimated. 4. We conclude that when applying MAR(1) models to ecological data, inferences on net effects among species should be limited to signs, or the Gompertz assumption should be tested and discussed. This particular assumption on density-dependence (log-linearity) is also required for unbiased long-term predictions. Overall, we think that MAR(1) models are highly useful tools to resolve and characterize community dynamics, but we recommend to use them in conjunction with alternative, nonlinear models resembling the ecological context in order to improve their interpretation in specific applications.",,,,"Barraquand, Frederic/G-1599-2011","Barraquand, Frederic/0000-0002-4759-0269","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas [217-2013-1315]; LabEx COTE [ANR-10-LABX-45]","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning, Grant/Award Number: 217-2013-1315; LabEx COTE, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-45",,,3,3,2,11,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Although the confidence intervals for local predictions are very narrow, the corresponding prediction intervals are very wide.

Recent studies developed models that integrate temperature and photoperiod signals into the network of floral regulatory genes, and predicted the shortening of flowering duration under warming based on the expression dynamics of major flowering-time genes in the perennial herb Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Nevertheless, empirical testing of the model prediction is still lacking. We performed temperature manipulation experiments and common garden experiments to test the model predictions using plants from two distant populations of A. halleri. We also quantified expression levels of two major flowering-time genes and compared the observed and predicted gene expression patterns. Our experiments in the laboratory and the field demonstrated that flowering duration of A. halleri was significantly shortened under warming conditions. Our results also revealed that the end of flowering was more sensitive to the climate warming than the onset of flowering in A. halleri. The observed gene expression dynamics in the warming condition were predicted well by the gene regulatory model. The transplant experiment of plants from Hokkaido, the northernmost island, to the subtropical field site in Okinawa, Japan, showed that plants flowered without significant activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T, a floral integrator crucial for the accelerated flowering in long days.

Here, we develop a forecast for the biomass change in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests of the southeastern United States and evaluate the relative contribution of different forms of uncertainty to the total forecast uncertainty. Specifically, we assimilated observations of carbon and flux stocks and fluxes from sites across the region, including global change experiments, into a forest ecosystem model to calibrate the parameter distributions and estimate the process uncertainty (i.e., model structure uncertainty revealed in the residuals of the calibration). Using this calibration, we forecasted the change in biomass within each 12-digit Hydrologic (H12) unit across the native range of loblolly pine between 2010 and 2055 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Averaged across the region, productivity is predicted to increase by a mean of 31% between 2010 and 2055 with an average forecast 95% quantile interval of +/- 15 percentage units. The largest increases were predicted in cooler locations, corresponding to the largest projected changes in temperature. The forecasted mean change varied considerably among the H12 units (3-80% productivity increase), but only units in the warmest and driest extents of the loblolly pine range had forecast distributions with probabilities of a decline in productivity that exceeded 5%. By isolating the individual components of the forecast uncertainty, we found that ecosystem model process uncertainty made the largest individual contribution. Ecosystem model parameter and climate model uncertainty had similar contributions to the overall forecast uncertainty, but with differing spatial patterns across the study region. The probabilistic framework developed here could be modified to include additional sources of uncertainty, including changes due to fire, insects, and pests: processes that would result in lower productivity changes than forecasted here. Overall, this study presents an ecological forecast at the ecosystem management scale so that land managers can explicitly account for uncertainty in decision analysis. Furthermore, it highlights that future work should focus on quantifying, propagating, and reducing ecosystem model process uncertainty.",,,,"Wynne, Randolph H/A-8966-2009","Wynne, Randolph H/0000-0003-3649-835X; Thomas, R.

Species' traits could indicate their capacity to undergo range shifts. However, it is not clear how range-shift capacity influences risk. We used traits from a recent evidence review to measure the relative potential of species to track changing climatic conditions. Location: Europe. Time period: Baseline period (1961-1990) and forecast period (2035-2064). Major taxa studied: 62 mammal species. Methods: We modelled species distributions using two general circulation models and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to calculate three metrics of ""exposure"" to climate change: range area gained, range area lost and distance moved by the range margin. We identified traits that could inform species' range-shift capacity (i.e., potential to establish new populations and proliferate, and thus undertake range shifts), from a recent evidence-based framework. The traits represent ecological generalization and reproductive strategy. We ranked species according to each metric of exposure and range-shift capacity, calculating sensitivity to ranking methods, and synthesized both exposure and range-shift capacity into ""risk syndromes."" Results: Many species studied whose survival depends on colonizing new areas were relatively unlikely to undergo range shifts. Under the worst-case scenario, 62% of species studied were relatively highly exposed. 47% were highly exposed and had relatively low range-shift capacity. Only 14% of species faced both low exposure and high range-shift capacity. Both range-shift and exposure metrics had a greater effect on risk assessments than climate models. Main conclusions: The degree to which species' potential ranges will be altered by climate change often does not correspond to species' range-shift capacities. Both exposure and range-shift capacity should be considered when evaluating biodiversity risk from climate change.",,,,"ESTRADA, ALBA/A-9632-2018","ESTRADA, ALBA/0000-0003-2727-1970; Hordley, Lisbeth/0000-0002-4924-6920",ERA-Net BiodivERsA,ERA-Net BiodivERsA,,,4,4,0,19,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Depending upon the environmental context, saltmarsh plants can facilitate or suppress mangrove recruitment. A field study was conducted within a mosaic saltmarsh at the edge of a mangrove forest fringing Tampa Bay, FL, USA, to investigate whether mangrove recruitment is influenced by the species composition of saltmarsh patches within which mangroves develop. Propagules of Avicennia germinans were emplaced into experimental plots at the same tidal elevation representing 3 saltmarsh treatments: (1) Distichlis littoralis in monoculture, (2) Sporobolus virginicus in monoculture, and (3) polycultures containing D. littoralis, S. virginicus, and at least one other species. Significantly fewer seedlings established in S. virginicus monocultures than in D. littoralis monocultures. Seedling establishment within the saltmarsh polyculture was intermediate to the grass monoculture treatments. Herbivory was the most commonly observed source of mortality for mangrove propagules, and propagules were more susceptible to herbivory within monocultures of S. virginicus relative to D. littoralis monocultures. Our results suggest that patch-scale heterogeneity in saltmarsh groundcover may influence spatial patterns of mangrove herbivory and recruitment at landward forest margins. This study builds on prior investigations and demonstrates that interactions between the same mangrove and saltmarsh species may differ between sites. Understanding these context-dependent interactions among saltmarsh plants and mangrove recruits can be useful for forecasting distributional shifts of mangrove populations and for implementing mangrove restoration.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,5,17,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

However, it has been proposed that taxa with sufficient standing genetic and ecologic diversity will better withstand climate change. These taxa are typically more broadly distributed in geographic and ecological niche space, therefore they are likely to endure higher levels of populations loss than more restricted, less diverse taxa before the effects of those losses impact their overall diversity and resilience. Here, we explore the potential relationship between intraspecific genetic and ecological diversity and future resilience, using the cold-adapted plant Primula farinosa. We employ high-throughput sequencing to assess the genomic diversity of phylogeographic lineages in P. farinosa. Additionally, we use current climatic variables to define niche breadth and niche differentiation across lineages. Finally, we calibrate species distribution models (SDMs) and project the climatic preferences of each lineage on future climate to predict lineage-specific shifts in climatically suitable habitats. Our study predicts relative persistence of future suitable habitats for the most genetically and ecologically diverse lineages of the cold-adapted P. farinosa, but significant reduction of them for two out of its four lineages. While we do not provide specific experiments aimed at identifying the causal links between genetic diversity and resilience to climate change, our results indicate that greater genetic diversity and wider ecological breadth may buffer species responses to rapid climatic changes.

To support those decisions, the roles that freshwater scientists must fulfil are rapidly evolving, and now is a good time to ask: What roles must scientists fulfil to best support those decisions? What are the major barriers to seeing those roles fulfilled? How can those barriers be removed? We offer potential answers to these questions. To ensure our arguments are grounded within real policy and decision problems, they are framed within the context of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin Planlegislation to guide the management of environmental flowsand its associated Watering Strategy. These problems are not unique, so the challenges and solutions we identify have broader applicability to flow management. Indeed, many of the policy and decision problems we present are common to all ecosystem types, so our arguments will likely be applicable beyond freshwater ecosystems. We argue that scientists must fulfil four roles to support flows management: (1) Monitoring and evaluation of ecosystems to support scientifically defensible reporting of outcomes, and to reduce uncertainty through adaptive management. (2) Modelling to support spatial and temporal projections of ecosystem change under different flow scenarios, resulting in more effective management decisions; improved causal inference about flow effects; identification of threats to the efficacy of flow management; and scaling flow-response dynamics to broader spatial extents. (3) Fundamental research, resulting in improved outcomes through the identification of non-flow management interventions that work in synergy with environmental flows and improved understanding of the ecological limitations of current policy. (4) Decision science, leading to more defensible environmental flow decisions and more efficient use of resources. We identify key barriers specific to each role and offer possible remedies. We argue that a major impediment to seeing these roles fulfilled is the ad hoc nature of much of the current research effort. Investment in research must (1) be developed at the basin scale, to ensure science supports decision problems that span multiple scales; (2) be developed as a collaboration between all stakeholders to ensure that science investments remain aligned with decision problems; (3) recognise the need to build and maintain technical capacity within the four roles.",,,,"Bond, Nick/A-1129-2016; Nicol, Sam/I-1074-2012","Bond, Nick/0000-0003-4294-6008; Nicol, Sam/0000-0002-1160-7444; Stoffels, Rick/0000-0003-4888-5875",Murray-Darling Basin Joint Governments,Murray-Darling Basin Joint Governments,,,7,7,5,18,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Human activities exert stress on and create disturbances to ecosystems, decreasing their diversity, resilience and ultimately the health of ecosystems and their vegetation. In environments with rapid changes in vegetation health (VH), progress is needed when it comes to monitoring these changes and underlying causes. There are different approaches to monitoring VH such as in situ species approaches and the remote-sensing approach. 2. Here we provide an overview of in situ species approaches, that is, the biological, the phylogenetic, and the morphological species concept, as well as an overview of the remote-sensing spectral trait/spectral trait variations concept to monitor the status of VH as well as processes of stress, disturbances, and resource limitations affecting VH. The approaches are compared with regard to their suitability for monitoring VH, and their advantages, disadvantages, potential, and requirements for being linked are discussed. 3. No single approach is sufficient to monitor the complexity and multidimensionality of VH over the short to long term and on local to global scales. Rather, every approach has its pros and cons, making it all the more necessary to link approaches. In this paper, we present a framework and list crucial requirements for coupling approaches and integrating additional monitoring elements to form a multisource vegetation health monitoring network (MUSO-VH-MN). 4. When it comes to linking the different approaches, data, information, models or platforms in a MUSO-VH-MN, big data with its complexity and syntactic and semantic heterogeneity and the lack of standardized approaches and VH protocols pose the greatest challenge.

Spatiotemporal ecological modelling of terrestrial ecosystems relies on climatological and biophysical Earth observations. Due to their increasing availability, global coverage, frequent acquisition and high spatial resolution, satellite remote sensing (SRS) products are frequently integrated to in situ data in the development of ecosystem models (EMs) quantifying the interaction among the vegetation component and the hydrological, energy and nutrient cycles. This review highlights the main advances achieved in the last decade in combining SRS data with EMs, with particular attention to the challenges modellers face for applications at local scales (e.g. small watersheds). 2. We critically review the literature on progress made towards integration of SRS data into terrestrial EMs: (1) as input to define model drivers; (2) as reference to validate model results; and (3) as a tool to sequentially update the state variables, and to quantify and reduce model uncertainty. 3. The number of applications provided in the literature shows that EMs may profit greatly from the inclusion of spatial parameters and forcings provided by vegetation and climatic-related SRS products. Limiting factors for the application of such models to local scales are: (1) mismatch between the resolution of SRS products and model grid; (2) unavailability of specific products in free and public online repositories; (3) temporal gaps in SRS data; and (4) quantification of model and measurement uncertainties. This review provides examples of possible solutions adopted in recent literature, with particular reference to the spatiotemporal scales of analysis and data accuracy. We propose that analysis methods such as stochastic downscaling techniques and multi-sensor/multi-platform fusion approaches are necessary to improve the quality of SRS data for local applications. Moreover, we suggest coupling models with data assimilation techniques to improve their forecast abilities. 4. This review encourages the use of SRS data in EMs for local applications, and underlines the necessity for a closer collaboration among EM developers and remote sensing scientists. With more upcoming satellite missions, especially the Sentinel platforms, concerted efforts to further integrate SRS into modelling are in great demand and these types of applications will certainly proliferate.",,,,"Casagrandi, Renato/L-3985-2013; Bustamante, Javier/C-2735-2008; Domingo-Marimon, Cristina/R-2076-2019; Karnieli, Arnon/F-1782-2012; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Poursanidis, Dimitris/M-8957-2013; Pasetto, Damiano/R-3973-2016; Chrysoulakis, Nektarios/AAG-6092-2020; Bustamante, Javier/AAA-7273-2019; Domingo-Marimon, Cristina/J-4870-2017; Arenas-Castro, Salvador/I-4024-2013; Manakos, Ioannis/AAD-5404-2019; Palazzi, Elisa/C-7048-2015; Monteiro, Antonio/L-8710-2013","Casagrandi, Renato/0000-0001-5177-803X; Bustamante, Javier/0000-0001-7515-0677; Domingo-Marimon, Cristina/0000-0001-6822-8704; Karnieli, Arnon/0000-0001-8065-9793; Poursanidis, Dimitris/0000-0003-3228-280X; Pasetto, Damiano/0000-0001-6892-9826; Chrysoulakis, Nektarios/0000-0002-5208-626X; Bustamante, Javier/0000-0001-7515-0677; Domingo-Marimon, Cristina/0000-0001-6822-8704; Arenas-Castro, Salvador/0000-0001-8671-4968; Palazzi, Elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; Terzago, Silvia/0000-0001-7867-0440; Monteiro, Antonio/0000-0002-9462-5938; Ziemba, Alexander/0000-0002-8293-6376; Cord, Anna/0000-0003-3183-8482",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [641762],"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 641762",,,14,15,6,44,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The models currently used, such as metapopulation models, population dynamics [e.g., the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model] with diffusion process, and models using individual-based mechanisms, require specific parameters according to the assumed mechanisms. These parameters are difficult to obtain immediately after the first infestation is detected, although subsequent pandemics of novel pathogens and non-indigenous pest organisms can be fatal to humans and damage agriculture and native ecosystems. Innovation: A simple machine-learning approach was developed. The future distribution of the target species was predicted by composing the spreading patterns of the previous range expansions of various alien species similar to the target species. A matrix representing the early-late relationship of infestation between regions was used to compare and compose various range expansion patterns. The eigenvector of the composed matrix gives the predicted order of infestation. Spreading speed was considered using the standard deviation of infestation dates, and future infestation dates were calculated by a reduced major axis with the eigenvector. In the feasibility assessment, the study area (Japan) was divided into many small regions (prefectures), and the dates of infestation in these regions were predicted. Our method successfully predicted the infestation dates of various alien species and the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. Main conclusions: Our method is less complex and requires simpler information than other methods and is applicable to all organisms. Constructing a database of the range expansions of alien species, including novel pathogens and agricultural and environmental pests, at the global level and with high spatial resolution, such as at the county or city level, will facilitate the prediction of future range expansions of hazardous organisms.",,,,"Koike, Fumito/F-5774-2011","Koike, Fumito/0000-0002-6588-6485","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Global COE (Center of Excellence) Program ""Global Eco-Risk Management from Asian Viewpoints"" [E03]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25440234]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Global COE (Center of Excellence) Program E03 ""Global Eco-Risk Management from Asian Viewpoints""; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), Grant/Award Number: 25440234",,,0,0,1,5,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

This study spans several decades of temperature recordings and is carried out in ten grapevine-growing areas. A time-varying distributed delay with attrition model, linked to a grapevine phenology model, is used to simulate the development of S. titanus populations and produce an annual Climatic Suitability Index (CSI). Area-specific CSI time series were obtained. The Breusch-Godfrey test revealed few significant partial autocorrelations in nine areas and the occurrence of six consecutive - first decreasing and then increasing - partial correlations in one case only. The occurrence of abrupt and gradual changes of the index were studied via multiple least square regression analyses. In general, the climatic suitability of all areas tended to improve through time. However, gradual and abrupt temperature changes were not consistently reflected in gradual and abrupt CSI patterns: abrupt and gradual CSI changes were observed in two areas, abrupt changes were detected in three areas, and exclusively gradual changes in the remaining five. Pest control institutions of the region under study may deal with different scenarios of pest status such as long-time presence and increasing risks, high colonization risks or limited colonization risks for the foreseeable future. Institutions charged with pest control elsewhere are advised to use a mechanistic demographic model to study area-specific infestation patterns and colonization risks because the results obtained here cannot be transferred to other areas without site-specific evaluations.",,,,"Mariani, Luigi/AAB-9464-2019; cola, gabriele/AAM-2498-2020","cola, gabriele/0000-0003-2561-0908",,,,,0,0,2,11,,,,1146-609X,1873-6238,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

In recent years, the potential for existing and emerging pathogens of agricultural crops to cause increased yield losses as a consequence of changing climatic patterns has raised considerable concern. In contrast, the response of naturally occurring, endemic pathogens to a warming climate has received little attention. Here, we report on the impact of a signature variable of global climate change - increasing temperature - on the long-term epidemiology of a natural host-pathogen association involving the rust pathogen Triphragmium ulmariae and its host plant Filipendula ulmaria. In a host-pathogen metapopulation involving approximately 230 host populations growing on an archipelago of islands in the Gulf of Bothnia we assessed changes in host population size and pathogen epidemiological measures over a 25-year period. We show how the incidence of disease and its severity declines over that period and most importantly demonstrate a positive association between a long-term trend of increasing extinction rates in individual pathogen populations of the metapopulation and increasing temperature. Our results are highly suggestive that changing climatic patterns, particularly mean monthly growing season (April-November) temperature, are markedly influencing the epidemiology of plant disease in this host-pathogen association. Given the important role plant pathogens have in shaping the structure of communities, changes in the epidemiology of pathogens have potentially far-reaching impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes. For these reasons, it is essential to increase understanding of pathogen epidemiology, its response to warming, and to invoke these responses in forecasts for the future.",,,,,"Burdon, Jeremy/0000-0002-4792-4986",Swedish Natural Science Research Council; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council,Swedish Natural Science Research Council; Swedish Research Council,,,4,4,4,41,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Climate novelty challenges models that correlate ecological patterns to climate variables and then use these relationships to forecast ecological responses to future climate change. Here, we quantify the magnitude and ecological significance of future climate novelty by comparing it to novel climates over the past 21,000 years in North America. We then use relationships between model performance and climate novelty derived from the fossil pollen record from eastern North America to estimate the expected decrease in predictive skill of ecological forecasting models as future climate novelty increases. We show that, in the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) and by late 21st century, future climate novelty is similar to or higher than peak levels of climate novelty over the last 21,000 years. The accuracy of ecological forecasting models is projected to decline steadily over the coming decades in response to increasing climate novelty, although models that incorporate co-occurrences among species may retain somewhat higher predictive skill. In addition to quantifying future climate novelty in the context of late Quaternary climate change, this work underscores the challenges of making reliable forecasts to an increasingly novel future, while highlighting the need to assess potential avenues for improvement, such as increased reliance on geological analogs for future novel climates and improving existing models by pooling data through time and incorporating assemblage-level information.",,,,"Fitzpatrick, Matt/F-7620-2010; Lugilde, Diego Nieto/A-2617-2009","Fitzpatrick, Matt/0000-0003-1911-8407; Lugilde, Diego Nieto/0000-0003-4135-2881; Williams, John/0000-0001-6046-9634","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1257033, DEB-1257164, DEB-1257508]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1257033, DEB-1257164, DEB-1257508",,,13,13,4,21,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We assessed the effects of these factors on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) balance in biocrusted soils using a sequence of manipulations over a 9-year period. We warmed biocrusted soils by 2 and, later, by 4 degrees C to better capture updated forecasts of future temperature at a site on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We also watered soils to alter monsoon-season precipitation amount and frequency and had plots that received both warming and altered precipitation treatments. Within treatment plots, we used 20 automated flux chambers to monitor net soil exchange (NSE) of CO2 hourly, first in 2006-2007 and then again in 2013-2014, for a total of 39 months. Net CO2 efflux from biocrusted soils in the warming treatment increased a year after the experiment began (2006-2007). However, after 9 years and even greater warming (4 degrees C), results were more mixed, with a reversal of the increase in 2013 (i.e., controls showed higher net CO2 efflux than treatment plots) and with similarly high rates in all treatments during 2014, a wet year. Over the longer term, we saw evidence of reduced photosynthetic capacity of the biocrusts in response to both the temperature and altered precipitation treatments. Patterns in biocrusted soil CO2 exchange under experimentally altered climate suggest that (1) warming stimulation of CO2 efflux was diminished later in the experiment, even in the face of greater warming; and (2) treatment effects on CO2 flux patterns were likely driven by changes in biocrust species composition and by changes in root respiration due to vascular plant responses.",,,,"Darrouzet-Nardi, Anthony/K-4054-2019","Darrouzet-Nardi, Anthony/0000-0002-2825-7962; Grote, Edmund/0000-0002-9103-9482; Reed, Sasha/0000-0002-8597-8619","U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC-0008168]; U.S. Geological Survey's Climate and Land Use and Ecosystems Mission Areas","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program, under award number DE-SC-0008168, as well as U.S. Geological Survey's Climate and Land Use and Ecosystems Mission Areas.

We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species' responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging withmetrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned inmeasuring phenotypic responses to short-termclimate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change.",,,,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1558056]; UC Davis Animal Behavior Graduate Group; Institutional Development Award (IDeA) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P20GM103395],CW acknowledges funding from the National Science Foundation grant (IOS-1558056).

Can hydrodynamic and geomorphological features be used to predict the establishment of macrophyte communities at the shoreline scale? LocationsTwo large, shallow lakes, southwest France. MethodsBased on field observations (vegetation occurrence and anthropogenic modifications of the shore) and data generated by a geographic information system (wave exposure, wave-induced sediment re-suspension, slope and land cover), we defined sites and community groups using cluster and indicator species analyses. The groups were then analysed by means of a statistical classifier (Random Forest). These different steps in data treatment enabled us to characterize the importance of each physical factor in determining macrophyte occurrence and distribution. As a result, a predictive map to forecast aquatic plant distribution at the shoreline scale was obtained. ResultsAnthropogenic disturbances were less important parameters than natural physical variables in structuring the distribution of lakeshore macrophytes. Within natural factors, wave-induced sediment re-suspension and slope had the most impact; nevertheless, the presence of swimming areas seemed to have a strong impact on aquatic habitats, being correlated with the total absence of aquatic vegetation. The predictive map obtained through the model spatially defined the position and occurrence of suitable sites for the settlement of both invasive and rare and endangered species. ConclusionsIn this study, natural disturbances play a major role in structuring aquatic plant distribution over physical anthropogenic factors. The model contributes to improving knowledge on plant communities with respect to local hydrodynamic and morphological features of lakeshores. Furthermore, the model provides a predictive map as a useful tool for the management of aquatic vegetation in temperate shallow lakes.",,,,"Boutry, Sebastien/AAC-2141-2020","Boutry, Sebastien/0000-0001-8046-585X; Alard, Didier/0000-0003-2703-908X",Office National des Forets (ONF); Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (AEAG); Conseil Regional Nouvelle Aquitaine (CCRRDT); Regional Research and Development Program (PSDR),Office National des Forets (ONF); Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (AEAG); Conseil Regional Nouvelle Aquitaine (CCRRDT); Regional Research and Development Program (PSDR),,,2,2,2,20,,,,1402-2001,1654-109X,,APPL VEG SCI,Appl.

The majority of SDMs use climate data or other abiotic variables to forecast the potential distribution of a species in geographic space. Biotic interactions can affect the predicted spatial distribution of a species in many ways across multiple spatial scales, and incorporating these predictors in an SDM is a current topic in the scientific literature. Constrictotermes cyphergaster is a widely distributed termite in the Neotropics. This termite species nests in plants and more frequently nests in some arboreal species. Thus, this species is an excellent model to evaluate the influence of biotic interactions in SDMs. We evaluate the influences of climate and the geographic distribution of host plants on the potential distribution of C.cyphergaster. Three correlative models (MaxEnt) were built to predict the geographic distribution of the termite: (1) climate data, (2) biotic data (i.e., the geographic distribution of host plants), and (3) climate and biotic data. The models that were generated indicate that the potential geographic distribution of C.cyphergaster is concentrated in the Cerrado and Caatinga regions. In addition, path analysis and multiple regression revealed the importance of the direct effects of biological interactions in the geographic distribution of the termite, while climate affected the distribution of the termite mainly through indirect effects by influencing the geographic distributions of host plants. The current study endorses the importance of including biological interactions in SDMs. We recommend using biotic predictors in SDM studies of insect species, mainly because insects have important environmental services and biotic interaction data can improve the macroecological studies of this group. Resumo Os modelos de distribuicAo de especies (SDMs) tem sido amplamente utilizados na literatura cientifica.

Interacoes bioticas podem afetar a distribuicAo espacial predita de uma especie de varias maneiras em multiplas escalas espaciais, incorporar esses preditores em um SDM e um topico atual. Constrictotermes cyphergaster e uma especie de cupim com ampla distribuicAo no Neotropico. Esta especie nidifica em especies de plantas, principalmente de porte arboreo. Assim, esta especie e um excelente modelo para avaliar a influencia das interacoes bioticas em SDMs. Avaliamos a influencia do clima e da distribuicAo geografica das plantas hospedeiras sobre a distribuicAo potencial de C.cyphergaster.

Os modelos que foram gerados indicam que a distribuicAo geografica potencial de C.cyphergaster esta concentrada no Cerrado e na Caatinga. Alem disso, a analise de caminho e a regressAo multipla revelaram a importancia dos efeitos diretos das interacoes biologicas na distribuicAo geografica dos cupins, enquanto o clima afetou a distribuicAo do cupim principalmente atraves de efeitos indiretos influenciando a distribuicAo geografica das plantas hospedeiras.

We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and a change-point model to examine the long-term dynamics of a desert rodent community undergoing compositional change over a 38-yr span. Our approach detected three rapid reorganization events, where changes in the relative abundances of dominant and rare species occurred, and a separate period of increased variance in the structure of the community. These events coincided with time periods, possibly related to climate events, where the total abundance of rodents was extremely low. There are a variety of processes that could link low abundance events with a higher probability of rapid ecological transitions, including higher importance of stochastic processes (i.e., competitive interactions or priority effects) and the removal of structuring effects of competitive dominants or incumbent species.

Within a climatic regime, topography, soil characteristics, and vegetation are expected to determine how the combined effects of precipitation, temperature, and evaporative demand of the atmosphere shape the spatial and temporal patterns of water within the soil profile and across a landscape. To forecast how desert landscapes may respond to future dimatic conditions, it is imperative to improve our understanding of these ecohydrologic processes. Here, we report on 27 yr of monthly soil volumetric water content (VWC) measurements and associated soils data from a site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert of North America. The dataset includes VWC and soil properties measured to 3 m in depth across 15 locations that encompass a range of Chihuahuan Desert vegetation types. We use this unique dataset (1) to generate insights into general temporal and depth patterns in VWC, (2) to analyze how VWC corresponds to measures of climatic conditions, and (3) to qualitatively evaluate the relative importance of soils, topographic setting, and vegetation type in mediating temporal patterns in VWC. Analyses of this unique dataset emphasize the importance of soil and topographic setting in determining depth and temporal patterns in VWC across time. Results emphasize the episodic nature of deep wetting events in our study system-essentially limited to three large events over the 27-yr record driven primarily by wetter than normal winters. Comparison of soil water dynamics between mesquite shrub coppice dunes and interspace soils suggests the ""island of fertility"" concept does not extend to soil water. Median VWC was strongly coupled to climatic conditions over surprisingly long windows at most locations (6-18 months), suggesting that soil water at depth is decoupled from short climatic pulses. However, VWC dynamics and VWC-climate relationships varied among locations, depths, and seasons, with unexpected similarities in ecohydrologic dynamics observed among very different vegetation types (e.g., an eroded creosote shrubland and a playa grassland). These results further underscore the importance of ecohydrological investigations in these ecosystems, given forecasts for a warmer and more variable climate in deserts globally.",,,,,"Duniway, Michael/0000-0002-9643-2785",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 12-35828]; USDA-ARS CRIS Project at the Jornada Experimental Range [6235-11210-007]; U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area,"This research was funded by National Science Foundation grants to New Mexico State University for the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 12-35828), the USDA-ARS CRIS Project at the Jornada Experimental Range (#6235-11210-007), and to the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area.

It is well known that root system inputs are the source of most grassland SOC, but the impact of grazing on partitioning of carbon allocation to root tissue production compared to fine root exudation is unclear. Given that different forms of root C have differing implications for SOC synthesis and decomposition, this represents a significant gap in knowledge. Root exudates should contribute to SOC primarily after microbial assimilation, and thus promote microbial contributions to SOC based on stabilization of microbial necromass, whereas root litter deposition contributes directly as plant-derived SOC following microbial decomposition. Here, we used insitu isotope pulse-chase methodology paired with plant and soil sampling to link plant carbon allocation patterns with SOC pools in replicated long-term grazing exclosures in subtropical pasture in Florida, USA. We quantified allocation of carbon to root tissue and measured root exudation across grazed and ungrazed plots and quantified lignin phenols to assess the relative contribution of microbial vs. plant products to total SOC. We found that grazing exclusion was associated with dramatically less overall belowground allocation, with lower root biomass, fine root exudates, and microbial biomass. Concurrently, grazed pasture contained greater total SOC, and a larger fraction of SOC that originated from plant tissue deposition, suggesting that higher root litter deposition under grazing promotes greater SOC. We conclude that grazing effects on SOC depend on root system biomass, a pattern that may generalize to other C4-dominated grasslands, especially in the subtropics. Improved understanding of ecological factors underlying root system biomass may be the key to forecasting SOC and optimizing grazing management to enhance SOC accumulation.",,,,"Strickland, Michael/B-7137-2016; Bianchi, Thomas/L-4060-2014","Strickland, Michael/0000-0001-5349-0363; Bianchi, Thomas/0000-0002-3068-2933; Hutchings, Jack/0000-0003-3396-6787; Wilson, Chris/0000-0001-7695-8299",Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1501686]; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1501686],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/ Award Number: 1501686; NSF DDIG, Grant/Award Number: 1501686",,,18,18,33,154,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Understanding how functional traits, which are key for plant functioning, relate to demographic parameters of populations is central to tackle pending issues in plant ecology such as the forecast of the fate of populations and communities in a changing world, the quantification of community assembly processes or the improvement of species distribution models. We addressed this question in the case of species from a Mediterranean rangeland of southern France. 2. Changes in species abundance in response to management intensification (fertilization and increased grazing pressure) were followed over a 28-year period. Probabilities of presence, and elasticities of the changes in the probability of space occupancy to colonization and survival, which are analogues of demographic parameters, were calculated for 53 species from the time series of abundance data using a space occupancy model. Nine quantitative traits pertaining to resource use, plant morphology, regeneration and phenology were measured on these species and related to demographic parameters. 3. The long-term dynamics of species in response to management intensification was associated with major changes in functional traits and strategies. Changes in the probability of occurrence-analogous to population growth rate-were correlated with traits describing the fast-slow continuum of leaf functioning. The elasticity of population growth rate to colonization was significantly related to reproductive plant height and seed mass, and to a lower extent, to leaf carbon isotopic ratio. 4. Synthesis. The functional response of species to management intensification corresponds to a shift along the second axis of a recently identified global spectrum of plant form and function, which maps, to some extent, onto the fast-slow continuum of life-history strategies. By contrast, the elasticity of colonization relates to the global spectrum axis capturing the size of organs. Seed mass contributes to this axis and is assumed to relate to one of the important traits structuring the reproductive strategy axis of life histories as well, namely net reproductive rate. While this mapping between functional and life-history traits is appealing, further tests in contrasting types of communities are required to assess its degree of generality.",,,,"Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",H2020 European Research Council [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS]; DivHerbe project (EcoGER National Programme),"H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS; DivHerbe project (EcoGER National Programme)",,,6,6,7,35,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The abundance and distribution of mammalian species often change in response to environmental variability, losses or gains in suitable habitat and, in the case of pest species, control programs. Consequently, conventional distribution maps rapidly become out of date and fail to provide useful information for wildlife managers. For invasive brushtail possum populations in New Zealand, the main causes of change are control programs by central and local government agencies, and post-control recovery through recolonisation and in situ recruitment. Managers need to know current, and likely future, possum population levels relative to control targets to help assess success at preventing the spread of disease or for protecting indigenous species. Information on the outcomes of government-funded possum control needs to be readily available to members of the general public interested in issues such as conservation, disease management and animal welfare. Aims. To produce dynamic, scalable maps of the current and predicted future distribution and abundance of possums in New Zealand, taking into account changes due to control, and to use recent visualisation technology to make this information accessible to managers and the general public for assessing control strategies at multiple spatial scales. Methods. We updated an existing individual-based spatial model of possum population dynamics, extending it to represent all individuals in a national population of up to 40 million. In addition, we created a prototype interface for interactive web-based presentation of the model's predictions. Key results. The improved capability of the new model for assessing possum management at local-to-national scales provided for real-time, mapped updates and forecasts of the distribution and abundance of possums in New Zealand. The versatility of this platform was illustrated using scenarios for current and emerging issues in New Zealand. These are hypothetical incursions of possums, reinvasion of large areas cleared of possums, and impacts on animal welfare of national-scale management of possums as vectors of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Conclusions. The new individual-based spatial model for possum populations in New Zealand demonstrated the utility of combining models of wildlife population dynamics with high-speed computing capability to provide up-to-date, easily accessible information on a species' distribution and abundance. Applications include predictions for future changes in response to incursions, reinvasion and large-scale possum control. Similar models can be used for other species for which there are suitable demographic data, typically pest species, harvested species or species with a high conservation value.",,,,,,"Science and Innovation Group of New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [C09X0909]","Funding for this work was provided by the Science and Innovation Group of New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment through core funding (C09X0909) to New Zealand Crown Research Institutes.

Here we investigated the demographic history of the willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), and black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) through the Late Pleistocene using two complementary methods and whole genome data. Species distribution modeling (SDM) allowed us to estimate the total range size during the Last Interglacial (LIG) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) as well as to indicate potential population subdivisions. Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) allowed us to assess fluctuations in effective population size across the same period. Additionally, we used SDM to forecast the effect of future climate change on the three species over the next 50years. We found that SDM predicts the largest range size for the cold-adapted willow grouse and rock ptarmigan during the LGM. PSMC captured intraspecific population dynamics within the last glacial period, such that the willow grouse and rock ptarmigan showed multiple bottlenecks signifying recolonization events following the termination of the LGM. We also see signals of population subdivision during the last glacial period in the black grouse, but more data are needed to strengthen this hypothesis. All three species are likely to experience range contractions under future warming, with the strongest effect on willow grouse and rock ptarmigan due to their limited potential for northward expansion. Overall, by combining these two modeling approaches, we have provided a multifaceted examination of the biogeography of these species and how they have responded to climate change in the past.

As the climate continues to change, species are moving to track their climatic niches. Although we are gaining a clearer picture of where and how quickly species ranges are moving, a mechanistic understanding of these changes is still nascent. 2. Evolutionary changes in ranges and range-limiting traits over contemporary time-scales have received relatively little attention, possibly due to the mismatch in scale between rapid contemporary range shifts and the historical evolution of species ranges over millions of years. But recent experimental work has shown that range-limiting traits can evolve rapidly over decadal time-scales, effectively putting evolution back on the table towards the goal of a mechanistic understanding of contemporary range shifts. 3. Here, I review the role of evolution in shaping range shift responses to recent climate change from the perspective of the past (shared evolutionary history, or phylogenetic signal in range shifts and range-limiting traits), present (variation in range-limiting traits) and future (incorporating evolution of range-limiting traits into range forecasts from species distribution models). 4. In each of these areas, I found a critical role for evolution in understanding historical constraints and future changes in species ranges over contemporary time-scales: shared evolutionary history may constrain range shift responses for some taxa; compensatory mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution can modulate the range shift response; and incorporating evolution into species distribution models can qualitatively alter forecasts of future range shifts. 5. Yet, more can be done in this context, and so I conclude by outlining near- and long-term goals for improving our understanding of the role of evolution in shaping species ranges in a rapidly changing world.",,,,,,,,,,10,10,2,29,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

In contrast, many coral reef sponge species are able to tolerate climate change conditions projected for 2100. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning this tolerance, we explored the lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition of four sponge species with differing sensitivities to climate change, experimentally exposed to OW and OA levels predicted for 2100, under two CO2 Representative Concentration Pathways. Sponges with greater concentrations of storage lipid, phospholipids, sterols and elevated concentrations of n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LC PUFA), were more resistant to OW. Such biochemical constituents likely contribute to the ability of these sponges to maintain membrane function and cell homeostasis in the face of environmental change. Our results suggest that n-3 and n-6 LC PUFA are important components of the sponge stress response potentially via chain elongation and the eicosanoid stress-signalling pathways. The capacity for sponges to compositionally alter their membrane lipids in response to stress was also explored using a number of specific homeoviscous adaptation (HVA) indicators. This revealed a potential mechanism via which additional CO2 could facilitate the resistance of phototrophic sponges to thermal stress through an increased synthesis of membrane-stabilizing sterols. Finally, OW induced an increase in FA unsaturation in phototrophic sponges but a decrease in heterotrophic species, providing support for a difference in the thermal response pathway between the sponge host and the associated photosymbionts. Here we have shown that sponge lipids and FA are likely to be an important component of the sponge stress response and may play a role in facilitating sponge survival under future climate conditions.",,,,"Webster, Nicole S/G-4980-2011","Webster, Nicole S/0000-0002-4753-5278; Francis, David/0000-0002-4829-6926","Royal Society of New ZealandRoyal Society of New Zealand [VUW1505]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT120100480]; Australian Institute of Marine Science, Victoria University of Wellington; PADI foundation; Deakin University; VUW Doctoral Scholarship","Royal Society of New Zealand, Grant/Award Number: Marsden Fund (VUW1505); Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: FT120100480; Australian Institute of Marine Science, Victoria University of Wellington, the PADI foundation; Deakin University; VUW Doctoral Scholarship",,,11,11,2,24,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

These interactions are shaped by components of individual behavior, particularly foraging behaviors. However, few studies consider species' behavioral responses to warming to predict how species interactions will be affected by warming. We chose two complementary approaches to examine how climate warming may affect the behavior and interactions of aquatic intraguild predators. First, we measured behavioral responses to warming in six larval dragonfly species, expecting that feeding rate and activity would increase with temperature. Secondly, we conducted intraguild predation (IGP) trials with three species to understand how temperature affects IGP, and if species' behavioral responses to warming are indicative of the outcome of IGP interactions. Warming increased feeding rates by 42% on average across species but had no effect on activity rate. The magnitude of change in feeding rate was positively correlated with the maximum temperatures species experience across their ranges. Lastly, warming increased rates of IGP twofold, however, species' behavioral responses alone were not predictive of their susceptibility to become IG prey of other larvae at warmer temperatures. Our results provide evidence that IGP interactions may be greatly affected by future increases in temperature; however, activity responses to warming alone are weak predictors of the outcomes of these interactions.

Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) is an important invasive whose northern distribution appears to be limited by winter survival; however, kudzu's cold tolerance thresholds are uncertain. Here, we used biogeographic evidence to hypothesize that exposure to - 20 A degrees C is lethal for kudzu and thus determines its northern distribution limit. We evaluated this hypothesis using survival tests and electrolyte leakage to determine relative conductivity, a measure of cell damage, on 14 populations from eastern North America. Relative conductivity above 36% was lethal. Temperatures causing this damage averaged - 19.6 A degrees C for northern and - 14.4 A degrees C for southern populations, indicating kudzu acclimates to winter cold. To assess this, we measured relative conductivity of above- and belowground stems, and roots collected throughout the winter at a kudzu population in southern Ontario, Canada. Consistent with acclimation, the cold tolerance threshold of aboveground stems at the coldest time of year was - 26 A degrees C, while stems insulated from cold extremes survived to - 17 A degrees C-colder than the survival limits indicated by kudzu's biogeographic distribution. While these results do not rule out alternative cold limitations, they indicate kudzu can survive winters north of its current distribution. For kudzu, biogeography is not a proxy for climatic tolerance and continued northward migration is possible. Efforts to limit its spread are therefore prudent. These results demonstrate that physiological constraints inform predictions of climate-related changes in species distribution and should be considered where possible.",,,,,,National Sciences and Engineering Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Invasive Species Centre Partnership Fund from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Ontario Ministry of Education; University of TorontoUniversity of Toronto,"We are grateful to Karen Castro and the many other people who helped us locate and compile kudzu sites, and to Jessamyn Manson, Patrick Friesen, Murilo Peixoto, Florian Busch, and Jerri Lee, who assisted with field work.

Land abandonment predictions based on alternative future socioeconomic scenarios allow foretell the future of biota in Europe. From here, we predict how these forecasts may affect large-scale distribution of the Cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), an apex scavenger closely linked to Mediterranean agro-grazing systems. Location: Iberian Peninsula. Methods: Firstly, we modelled nest-site and foraging habitat selection in relation to variables quantifying physiography, trophic resources and human disturbance. Secondly, we evaluate to what extent land abandonment may affect the life traits of the species and finally we determined how potential future distribution of the species would vary according to asymmetric socioeconomic land-abandonment predictions for year 2040. Results: Cinereous vultures selected breeding areas with steep slopes and low human presence whereas foraging areas are characterized by high abundance of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and wild ungulates. Liberalization of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) could potentially transform positively 66% of the current nesting habitat, favouring the recovery of mature forest. Contrarily, land abandonment would negatively affect the 63% of the current foraging habitat reducing the availability of preferred food resources (wild European rabbit). On the other hand, the maintenance of the CAP would determine lower frequencies (24%-22%) of nesting and foraging habitat change. Main conclusions: Land abandonment may result into opposite effects on the focal species because of the increase in nesting habitats and wild ungulates populations and, on the other hand, lower availability of open areas with poorer densities of European rabbits. Land-abandonment models' scenarios are still coarse-grained; the apparition of new human uses in natural areas may take place at small-sized and medium-sized scales, ultimately adding complexity to the prediction on the future of biota and ecosystems.",,,,"Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Garcia-Baron, Isabel/L-1224-2019; Marques, Tiago A./M-3253-2019; CORTES-AVIZANDA, AINARA/O-3248-2019; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/B-3975-2009; Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara/C-6634-2013; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Garcia-Baron, Isabel/0000-0001-5962-0819; Marques, Tiago A./0000-0002-2581-1972; CORTES-AVIZANDA, AINARA/0000-0002-9674-6434; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/0000-0003-1043-1675; Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara/0000-0002-9674-6434; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104; Donazar, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-9433-9755","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2014-070597]; Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion [IJCI-2014-20744]; Programa Vicent Mut of Govern Balear, Spain [PD/039/2017]; Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empleo, Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [RNM-1925]; MINECO/FEDER EUEuropean Union (EU) [CGL2015-66966-C2-1-2-R]; Severo Ochoa Excellence Award from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2012-0262]; CEAUL; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAT/00006/2013]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: BES-2014-070597; Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion, Grant/Award Number: IJCI-2014-20744; Programa Vicent Mut of Govern Balear, Spain, Grant/Award Number: PD/039/2017; Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empleo, Junta de Andalucia, Grant/Award Number: RNM-1925; MINECO/FEDER EU, Grant/Award Number: CGL2015-66966-C2-1-2-R; Severo Ochoa Excellence Award from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: SEV-2012-0262; CEAUL; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Portugal, Grant/Award Number: UID/MAT/00006/2013",,,4,5,5,20,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

What controls the distribution and abundance of organisms? This question, at the heart of the dynamics of ecological communities, would have been familiar to the earliest ecologists. Having lain effectively abandoned for many years, community dynamics today is a vibrant research topic of great conceptual interest with practical import for conservation, ecological management, ecosystem services and the responses of ecological communities to climate change. 2.We describe how modern coexistence theory can be used to predict community dynamics through the use of demography. We explore the challenges that limit the deployment of this demographic framework, and the tools from phylogenetic and functional ecology that have been used to surmount them. 3. Finding existing tools not altogether sufficient, we propose the use of hard functional traits and physiological tolerances of environmental conditions and low resource availability to extend the demographic framework so that the dynamics of a broader range of ecological communities can be accurately predicted. 4. We illustrate these new approaches with two case studies. Given the urgent need to accurately forecast the dynamics of ecological communities, we hope that many ecologists will adopt these tools.",,,,"Duthie, A. Bradley/H-7211-2019; Paine, C. E.

We illustrate this point with an example of the Logan River, Utah, originally populated with endemic cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah), which compete with exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta). The coexistence equilibrium was disrupted by a large scale, experimental removal of the exotic species in 2009-2011 (on average, 8.2% of the stock each year), followed by an increase in the density of the native species. We built a spatially-explicit, reaction-diffusion model encompassing four key processes: population growth in heterogeneous habitat, competition, dispersal, and a management action. We calibrated the model with detailed long-term monitoring data (2001-2016) collected along the 35.4-km long river main channel. Our model, although simple, did a remarkable job reproducing the system steady state prior to the management action. Insights gained from the model independent predictions are consistent with available knowledge and indicate that the exotic species is more competitive; however, the native species still occupies more favorable habitat upstream. Dynamic runs of the model also recreated the observed increase of the native species following the management action. The model can simulate two possible distinct long-term outcomes: recovery or eradication of the exotic species. The processing of available knowledge using Bayesian methods allowed us to conclude that the chance for eradication of the invader was low at the beginning of the experimental removal (0.7% in 2009) and increased (20.5% in 2016) by using more recent monitoring data. We show that accessible mathematical and numerical tools can provide highly informative insights for managers (e.g., outcome of their conservation actions), identify knowledge gaps, and provide testable theory for researchers.",,,,,"Santoul, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-2172","Utah Division of Wildlife Resources; U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; U.S. Geological Survey Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research UnitUnited States Geological Survey; Ecology Center at Utah State University; INPT; Utah State University IACUC [2022]","The data collection component of this study was funded by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.

Private lands contain much of the world's biodiversity. Conservation of private land, especially agricultural land, is urgent yet challenging because of the diverse priorities of landowners. Local effects of farmland conservation programmes have been evaluated thoroughly, but population-level response to these programmes may depend on effects that extend beyond targeted land parcels. We investigated the landscape-scale effects of a grassland conservation initiative, the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), on a socially and economically important game bird, the Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus. 2. Barriers to assessing population-level response to conservation include determining the spatial scale at which a species responds to environmental change (the scale of effect) and untangling density-dependent processes. We performed point counts over 6 years at 247 sites with similar local CREP density but varying land-scape-scale CREP density. We used an open-population distance sampling model to evaluate population response to landscape-level CREP density and to forecast population densities under differing re-enrolment scenarios. Our model included kernel smoothing techniques to estimate scale of effect and an estimator of the strength of density dependence. 3. Density dependence moderated the effectiveness of the CREP, but overall populations responded positively to increasing landscape-scale CREP density. We estimated that at least 5% of the landscape needs to be in CREP to meet population density goals of 0.25 bobwhite/ha. Conservatively, we recommend 10% of the landscape to be in CREP. Our percent cover recommendations are based on a distance-weighted average of CREP around focal sites. 4. Landscape-scale effects diminished with distance. For example, assuming all else is equal, a CREP field 3,000 m away had 88% less of an effect on local abundance than a field 1,000 m away. Fields farther than 5,000 m away had no effect on local abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study underscores the importance of a landscape-scale approach to farmland conservation. Benefits of these programmes to wildlife can extend beyond the local scale, but their importance to local populationsdiminishes with distance. Estimating this relationship and incorporating it into a decision framework could help practitioners target land enrolment to meet broad-scale population objectives.",,,,"Yeiser, John/L-1736-2019","Yeiser, John/0000-0002-0053-0664",Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources; Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act; University of Georgia,Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources; Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman-Robertson); University of Georgia,,,3,3,0,15,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

These impacts can be exacerbated by synergism with other global change drivers, such as biological invasions. Furcraea foetida (Asparagaceae) is a CAM species native to Central America and northern South America that is currently invading coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil. The species propagates clonally by bulbils, forming dense clusters that exclude native species. We addressed whether warming may favor or impair development of F. foetida bulbils based on functional traits and assessed whether plant cover of native species influenced F. foetida establishment in a rocky shore ecosystem. We used open-top chambers during summer and autumn, which increased air temperature during daylight hours by 0.4 A degrees C relative to ambient conditions. This short-term warming effect increased the leaf length of bulbils but had no effect on number of leaves, dry mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). However, an increase in vegetation cover decreased LDMC and helped maintain high Fv/Fm, having an indirect positive effect on F. foetida establishment that suggests a facilitation interaction in this extreme environment. Even though the manipulated temperature did not reach IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) forecasts for 2100, our data show that even small, short-term changes in temperature affected plant performance. Thus, we suggest that F. foetida may be favored in a scenario of climate change, increasing its negative effects on biodiversity of coastal ecosystems.",,,,"Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Peroni, Nivaldo/G-2091-2012","Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; Peroni, Nivaldo/0000-0002-6770-5377","CAPES/CNPq ""Science without Borders'' Program through the project ""Plant interactions and community dynamics in tropical, seasonal systems'' [114A-2013]; Postgraduate Program in Ecology (PPGECO/UFSC); CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); CAPESCAPES","This research was supported by the CAPES/CNPq ""Science without Borders'' Program through the project ""Plant interactions and community dynamics in tropical, seasonal systems'' (No 114A-2013) and by the Postgraduate Program in Ecology (PPGECO/UFSC).

Land-use planners and managers are often responsible for providing access to natural areas for recreation while avoiding environmental impacts such as declines of threatened species. Since recreation can have harmful effects on biodiversity, reliable information about protected-area visitation patterns is vital for managers. Our goal was to quantify recreational use in a fragmented urban reserve network and identify factors that influenced visitation. We empirically measured visitation rates at 18 reserves in San Diego County, California. Using random forest models, we identified biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influenced spatial variation in visitation rates and made projections to 27 additional reserves, validating with an expert opinion survey. Visitation rates varied widely across the reserve network. Accessibility variables, such as numbers of housing units and parking lots, were key explanatory variables that had positive relationships with visitation rates. To illustrate the applications of our models, we assessed the exposure of 7 species and subspecies of conservation concern to recreation by comparing predicted occurrence to projected visitation intensities. We found that several species and subspecies, including the orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), western spadefoot (Spea hcunmondii), and the federally-threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), are likely exposed to high levels of recreational activity.

This species exhibits many behaviors that make coastal sharks difficult to manage, including aggregatory behavior, sexual segregation, and large-scale migrations through shallow coastal waters with many opportunities for human interactions. Sand tigers from the Western North Atlantic subpopulation are known to seasonally inhabit Delaware Bay and surrounding coastal waters. This region has been recommended as a habitat area of particular concern for the Western North Atlantic sand tiger population, and increased understanding of their movements and habitat requirements will facilitate management efforts. We developed models to predict sand tiger occupancy using spatially dynamic environmental predictors. Our models predicted sand tiger (juveniles, adult males, adult females, and all sharks combined) occurrences in 2 study regions, the Delaware Bay and the western Mid-Atlantic coastal ocean. Sea surface temperature, day of year, water depth, and remote sensing reflectance at 555 nm were the most important environmental predictors of occurrence, and correctly predicted 80-89% of sand tiger acoustic telemetry records in the 2 study regions. Our models predicted differences in the timing and location of occurrences among juveniles and adults, as well as areas where these life history stages overlap in the Mid-Atlantic coastal ocean. Our hope is that a daily forecast of sand tiger occurrence from our modeling efforts could be useful for conservation and management efforts in this important region, as well as for studying the spatial and behavioral ecology of this important top predator.",,,,"Haulsee, Danielle/W-7513-2019","Haulsee, Danielle/0000-0003-0691-0278",Lenfest Ocean Program [00026773],"We thank 3 anonymous reviewers whose comments and critiques greatly improved this manuscript.

Time-series analyses were used to assess the potential dependence of future waterbird abundances on current changes in herring spawning biomass, independent of underlying trends or other dynamics in waterbird numbers or herring activity. Forecasts of winter waterbird abundance were significantly improved by considering the lagged effects of changes in herring spawning biomass. Impulse-response functions provided strong evidence that the dynamics of winter waterbird abundances include 'echoes' of response over time to any unusual pulse of herring activity, with carryover effects leading to sustained increases in waterbird species' abundances over multiple years, and increases in the abundance of all waterbird species (combined) over the subsequent 3 winters. Increases in waterbird abundance consistent with variance-prone responses to the pulsed availability of prey were sustained by periods of conditional variance-aversion associated with subsequent declines in herring spawning biomass to expected long-term levels. Annual spawning activity was highly variable, and when the availability of roe was relatively high, the potential consumption of herring eggs could account for up to 64% of the collective energy needs of waterbirds (all species combined) over the 90 d herring season (mean +/- SE = 20 +/- 3.6%). Several waterbird species shifted their bay distributions in response to herring spawning events within 2 d; however, some species that did not concentrate in spawning areas exhibited sustained annual increases in bay-wide winter abundance in response to increased herring spawning biomass.",,,,,,Point Reyes National Seashore,"We deeply appreciate the generous financial support of research in Tomales Bay provided by an anonymous donor to Audubon Canyon Ranch (ACR).

Such manipulation experiments often use factorial designs, and the data are analyzed using factorial linear models. Factorial designs build on the fundamental assumption that the treatment factors arc independent and orthogonal. This assumption is, however, often violated because of variation within and in particular covariation between the performed experimental manipulations. For example, manipulation of temperature and precipitation in factorial setups has been widely applied in climate experiments, but manipulating soil temperature will likely have a strong impact on soil water content. Such dependency among environmental state variables will violate the assumed orthogonality in a factorial linear model and may lead to erroneous conclusions. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the assumption of orthogonality using simulated ecological responses that act on observed soil state variables from a large climate experiment with an apparent orthogonal design. More specifically, we explore the problematic consequences of analyzing ecological treatments as categorical variables in a linear model. Suitable alternative methods for the statistical analysis of manipulated ecological experiments are suggested. The key recommendation is to use the observed effects of the manipulations on the state variables directly in the analysis instead of the categories of treatments. For example, if soil water content and temperature are manipulated, then it is essential to measure the water content and temperature in the soil of all the manipulated plots.",,,,"Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010; Schmidt, Inger K/A-6230-2015; Larsen, Klaus S/C-7549-2015; Holmstrup, Martin/I-7463-2013","Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312; Schmidt, Inger K/0000-0003-3880-2060; Larsen, Klaus S/0000-0002-1421-6182; Holmstrup, Martin/0000-0001-8395-6582",Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation; Air Liquide Denmark A/S; DONG Energy,"The CLIMAITE project (CLIMate change effects on biological processes In Terrestrial Ecosystems) was funded by the Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation and further supported by Air Liquide Denmark A/S, DONG Energy and the participating institutions.",,,2,2,0,6,,,,2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUN,2018,9,6,,,,,,,e02322,10.1002/ecs2.2322,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000439997600033,,,,,

Rising global temperature is expected to increase alpine glacier mass loss with cascading effects on alpine habitats and biota. Currently, there is limited information on the effects of climate change on alpine riparian vegetation including quantitative assessments of geophysical habitat context. 2. We measured geomorphic conditions and riparian vegetation composition of alpine streams across a chronosequence of sites supported hydrologically by glaciers, permanent snowfields (PS) and seasonal snowfields (SS) in Glacier National Park (GNP), Montana, USA. Responses in the system to possible climate-driven shifts in hydrologic regime were identified using multivariate analyses. 3. Glacier-fed streams had higher discharge and stream power and lower substrate stability than streams fed by PS and SS. Streams fed by PS supported a higher number of species than other stream types. Glacier-fed streams were characterised by higher abundance of disturbance-adapted shrub species than PS and SS. 4. By applying projections from climate models that forecast total glacial loss in GNP by 2030 to our data, we predict that stream geophysical conditions will shift, resulting in a loss of physical habitat for shrub species, an increase in habitat for herbaceous species, and ultimately a homogenisation of riparian communities in the alpine zone. 5. Our study identifies glaciers as drivers of alpine riverine ecosystems and highlights the importance of examining geophysical habitat linked to hydrologic regimes and glaciers to better understand the impacts to biota under future climate scenarios.

Despite the importance for science and management communities, our ability to forecast tree mortality at landscape to continental scales is limited. However, two independent information streams have the potential to inform and improve mortality forecasts: repeat forest inventories and satellite remote sensing. Time series of tree-level growth patterns indicate that productivity declines and related temporal dynamics often precede mortality years to decades before death. Plot-level productivity, in turn, has been related to satellite-based indices such as the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Here we link these two data sources to show that early warning signals of mortality are evident in several NDVI-based metrics up to 24 years before death. We focus on two repeat forest inventories and three NDVI products across western boreal North America where productivity and mortality dynamics are influenced by periodic drought. These data sources capture a range of forest conditions and spatial resolution to highlight the sensitivity and limitations of our approach. Overall, results indicate potential to use satellite NDVI for early warning signals of mortality. Relationships are broadly consistent across inventories, species, and spatial resolutions, although the utility of coarse-scale imagery in the heterogeneous aspen parkland was limited. Longer-term NDVI data and annually remeasured sites with high mortality levels generate the strongest signals, although we still found robust relationships at sites remeasured at a typical 5 year frequency.

It is widely believed that the northern distribution of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in North America is limited by cold winter temperatures and deep snow. Under all climate change scenarios, it is likely that the adverse effects of winter will diminish, which may result in a northward expansion of the distribution of white-tailed deer. Aims The goal of this project was to quantify the drivers of white-tailed deer distribution identified from a set of climate and land cover variables. We wanted to forecast changes to the northern limit on white-tailed deer distribution under several climate change scenarios. Methods We used an occupancy-modelling approach to identify the variables or combination of variables that best estimated the occupancy of white-tailed deer across a 140-site camera-observation network operating from 2013 to 2015. We validated our model using data from a mammal atlas from 1993. We used available data from climate change scenarios to predict and map changes to the northern limit of white-tailed deer distribution for three time horizons up to 2100. Key results Our models indicated that both climate and land cover had a determining influence on the northern limit of white-tailed deer distribution in our study area. Variables describing winter climate, in particular temperature and snow depth, were most closely associated with the northern edge of white-tailed deer distribution, and land cover variables added explanatory power. Our predictions suggested that white-tailed deer distribution will expand northward, given the retreat of severe winters. Conclusions White-tailed deer distribution is controlled by land-based habitat indicators and limited at a northern boundary by the severity of winter climate. Current CO2 emission scenarios indicate that winter conditions will no longer limit the northern distribution of white-tailed deer in our study area by the year 2100. Implications Under all climate change scenarios, the influx of white-tailed deer to new northern environments will likely impact the dynamics of other wildlife populations. The management of species such as moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in these regions must anticipate the disruptive potential of white-tailed deer.",,,,"Bowman, Jeff/B-4147-2009","Bowman, Jeff/0000-0002-1892-4469",Climate Change Office and Wildlife Policy Section of the OMNRF,"We would like to thank L.

In this paper, we retrospectively assess the performance of simple phenomenological models that incorporate early sub-exponential growth dynamics to generate short-term forecasts of the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in the UK. For this purpose, we employed the generalized-growth model (GGM) for pre-peak predictions and the generalized-Richards model (GRM) for post-peak predictions. The epidemic exhibits a growth-decelerating pattern as the relative growth rate declines inversely with time. The uncertainty of the parameter estimates or and pthorn narrows down and becomes more precise using an increasing amount of data of the epidemic growth phase. Indeed, using only the first 10-15 days of the epidemic, the scaling of growth parameter (p) displays wide uncertainty with the confidence interval for p ranging from values *0.5 to 1.0, indicating that less than 15 epidemic days of data are not sufficient to discriminate between sub-exponential (i.e., p < 1) and exponential growth dynamics (i. e., p = 1). By contrast, using 20, 25, or 30 days of epidemic data, it is possible to recover estimates of p around 0.6 and the confidence interval is substantially below the exponential growth regime. Local and national bans on the movement of livestock and a nationwide cull of infected and contiguous premises likely contributed to the decelerating trajectory of the epidemic. The GGM and GRM provided useful 10-day forecasts of the epidemic before and after the peak of the epidemic, respectively. Short-term forecasts improved as the model was calibrated with an increasing length of the epidemic growth phase. Phenomenological models incorporating generalized-growth dynamics are useful tools to generate short-term forecasts of epidemic growth in near real time, particularly in the context of limited epidemiological data as well as information about transmission mechanisms and the effects of control interventions.",,,,"Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945",NSF grant as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M008894/1]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; Fondo Basal-CONICYT grant (2014) [FB-0002],Authors acknowledge financial support from the NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; and UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/M008894/1.

In drylands, biological soil crust (biocrust) contribution to ecosystem carbon fluxes may vary at a regional scale but is rarely quantified due to the difficulty of parameterizing process-based models or parsing biocrust (on the soil surface) from whole-soil flux measurements. We measured excised biocrust carbon fluxes across current and future predicted warmer summertime temperatures from dryland sites (grassland, shrubland, savanna, and woodland) and compared those to the ecosystem and soil fluxes from eddy flux towers. Overall, biocrust fluxes showed net carbon loss during the warm growing season temperatures, suggesting that cool-season photosynthesis is likely critical for maintaining positive biocrust carbon balance in these sites. Biocrust flux temperature responses differed by site: Grassland and shrubland biocrust gross photosynthesis was relatively invariant, while respiration increased with temperature; in the woodland and savanna, biocrust gross photosynthesis and respiration increased with temperature. Biocrust fluxes contributed <3% to the observed ecosystem gross primary productivity at 26 degrees C and ecosystem respiration at 19 degrees C in grassland, shrubland, and woodland, but contributed >10% of observed soil respiration in grassland and shrubland at 19 degrees C, reinforcing the need to separate biocrust activity from root and subsurface heterotroph activity to understand drivers of fluxes at different sites.

However, non-climate factors may also critically influence species distribution and biological community assembly. The aim of this paper was to study how fire-vegetation dynamics can modify our ability to predict the impact of climate change on bird communities, as described through a widely-used climate change indicator: the community thermal index (CTI). Potential changes in bird species assemblage were predicted using the spatially-explicit species assemblage modelling framework - SESAM - that applies successive filters to constrained predictions of richness and composition obtained by stacking species distribution models that hierarchically integrate climate change and wildfire-vegetation dynamics. We forecasted future values of CTI between current conditions and 2050, across a wide range of fire-vegetation and climate change scenarios. Fire-vegetation dynamics were simulated for Catalonia (Mediterranean basin) using a process-based model that reproduces the spatial interaction between wildfire, vegetation dynamics and wildfire management under two IPCC climate scenarios. Net increases in CTI caused by the concomitant impact of climate warming and an increasingly severe wildfire regime were predicted. However, the overall increase in the CTI could be partially counterbalanced by forest expansion via land abandonment and efficient wildfire suppression policies. CTI is thus strongly dependent on complex interactions between climate change and fire-vegetation dynamics. The potential impacts on bird communities may be underestimated if an overestimation of richness is predicted but not constrained. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly incorporate these interactions when using indicators to interpret and forecast climate change impact in dynamic ecosystems. In fire-prone systems, wildfire management and land-use policies can potentially offset or heighten the effects of climate change on biological communities, offering an opportunity to address the impact of global climate change proactively.",,,,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009; Regos, Adrian/M-5207-2014; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Regos, Adrian/0000-0003-1983-936X; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815",,,,,10,11,3,21,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JUN,2018,41,6,,,,,982,995,,10.1111/ecog.02990,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000434091800011,,,,,

Understanding how extreme drought alters spatial patterns and temporal stability in grassland biomass will become increasingly important by the end of the century when climate model forecasts suggest drought events will occur more frequently. In grassland landscapes where grazing is driven by fire (termed pyric herbivory), temporal stability in above-ground plant biomass at landscape scales typically coincides with greater spatial variability across local communities (time-since-fire patches), whereas variability within local communities is associated with lower temporal stability. 2. We assess the robustness of this relationship during one of the most severe droughts on modern record in the southern Great Plains. We use a long-term pyric herbivory experiment to test whether extreme drought (1) changes patterns of spatial variability in above-ground plant biomass among or within local communities, (2) changes the temporal stability in above-ground plant biomass and the relationship between spatial variability and temporal variability and (3) changes the underlying feedback mechanisms associated with pyric herbivory. 3. Ordination revealed a shift from spatially distinct patches before drought to a convergence of patches during drought in terms of above-ground plant biomass and crude protein. Permutation tests revealed that within-patch variability in above-ground plant biomass significantly increased during drought compared to pre-drought levels. Temporal stability in above-ground plant biomass decreased during drought and indeed corresponded with reduced variability in biomass among local communities and increased variability within local communities compared to pre-drought levels. 4. The results from this study strongly suggest that both positive and negative feedback loops responsible for pyric herbivory were maintained by scale-switching during periods of extreme drought and further reinforce the importance of scale in the study of pattern-process relationships.",,,,,"Bielski, Christine/0000-0003-1131-7102","Joint Fire Science Program [11-1-2-19, 13-1-06-8]","Joint Fire Science Program, Grant/Award Number: 11-1-2-19 and 13-1-06-8",,,3,3,1,29,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The species status assessment (SSA) process has three successive stages: 1) document the life history and ecological relationships of the species in question to provide the foundation for the assessment, 2) describe and hypothesize causes for the current condition of the species, and 3) forecast the species' future condition. The future condition refers to the ability of a species to sustain populations in the wild under plausible future scenarios. The scenarios help explore the species' response to future environmental stressors and to assess the potential for conservation to intervene to improve its status. The SSA process incorporates modeling and scenario planning for prediction of extinction risk and applies the conservation biology principles of representation, resiliency, and redundancy to evaluate the current and future condition. The SSA results in a scientific report distinct from policy application, which contributes to streamlined, transparent, and consistent decision-making and allows for greater technical participation by experts outside of the USFWS, for example, by state natural resource agencies. We present two case studies based on assessments of the eastern massasauga rattlesnake Sistrurus catenatus and the Sonoran Desert tortoise Gopherus morafkai to illustrate the process. The SSA builds upon the past threat-focused assessment by including systematic and explicit analyses of a species' future response to stressors and conservation, and as a result, we believe it provides an improved scientific analysis for ESA decisions.",,,,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"We thank Greg Breese, Debby Crouse, Jonathan Cummings, Cat Darst, Beth Forbus, Carey Galst, Craig Hansen, Michael Horton, Donald Imm, Michelle Kissling, Mary Parkin, Mark Pavelka, Erin Rivenbark, Steve Morey, Marjorie Nelson, Tara Nicolaysen, Laura Ragan, Angela Romito, Justin Shoemaker, Jesse Wild, and all additional members of the SSA Framework Implementation Team for their contributions to the development of the SSA.

Developing this comprehensive perspective is difficult though, because species interactions are complex, interdependent, and dynamic through space and time. Typically, experiments focus on tractable subsets of interactions that will be most critical to investigate and explain shifts in communities, but qualitatively base these choices on experience, natural history, and theory. One quantitative approach to identify the putative forces regulating communities, without reducing system complexity, is estimating transition probabilities among species occupying space (i.e., multispecies Markov chain models). Although not mechanistic, these models estimate the relative frequency and importance of ecological pathways in community assembly and dynamics, and can serve as a framework to identify how pathways change across large scales and which are most important to investigate further. Here, we demonstrate this method in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) intertidal zone, where research has largely focused on the local-scale processes that influence communities, while the mechanisms responsible for more regional shifts in communities are less clear. Transition probabilities of faunal elements were quantified bimonthly for similar to 2.5yr in local intertidal communities at three replicate sites in the southern, mid-coast, and northern GOM. Transitions related to mortality, colonization, and replacement by mussels, barnacles, red algae, and encrusting corallines differed regionally, suggesting specific pathways related to consumer pressure and recruitment vary across the GOM with shifting intertidal community structure. Combined with species abundance data and insights from previous research, we develop and evaluate the pathways by which communities likely change in the GOM. Species interactions in local communities can be complex, and this complexity should be incorporated into hypothesis building, experiments, theory, interpretations, and forecasts in ecology. Such a comprehensive approach will be critical to understand how regional shifts in local interactions can drive large-scale community change.",,,,,,"University of Massachusetts Boston Research Trust Funds; Nancy Goranson Endowment Fund; Herbert Lipke Memorial Endowment Fund; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE - 1334022, 1458154]","Funding was provided by University of Massachusetts Boston Research Trust Funds, the Nancy Goranson Endowment Fund, and the Herbert Lipke Memorial Endowment Fund.

Understanding which life-history traits or abiotic factors moderate spread rates is important for designing trapping and eradication programs for invasive insects and for designing release protocols of imported natural enemies. Our aim was to identify variables that can explain variation in spread rates of introduced insects. Location: Global. Spread rates from 30 different countries were compiled. Time period: 1976-2014. Major taxon studied: Insecta. Methods: We compiled 147 published spread rates of 86 non-native insects. Spread rates were averaged per species so that each insect was only represented once in statistical analyses. Simultaneously, we collected information on several variables associated with the introduced insects such as adult longevity, diet breadth, diet preference, eusociality, fecundity, taxonomic order, role of passive dispersal (important versus not important), size, type (invasive species versus biological control agent), voltinism (i.e., the number of generations per year) and duration of spread. In addition to analysis of the complete data set, analyses of several subsets of the data were conducted to determine robustness and sensitivity of findings. Results: In the global analysis, voltinism was clearly the most significant predictor of spread rates. Insects with more than one generation per year spread faster than those with one or fewer generations. Analyses limited to either invasive species or importation biological agents further confirmed that multivoltine insects spread faster on average than univoltine insects. Main conclusions: Whereas previous work has shown that accidentally introduced insects spread faster than those introduced intentionally, the identification of voltinism as a key predictor of spread may enhance risk analyses and accuracy of forecasting, especially where a changing climate may alter patterns of voltinism.",,,,,,"College of Food, Agricultural, and Natural Resource Sciences at the University of Minnesota; McKnight Land-Grant; USDA Forest Service award [15-DG-1142004-237]; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System","College of Food, Agricultural, and Natural Resource Sciences at the University of Minnesota; McKnight Land-Grant Professorship; USDA Forest Service award 15-DG-1142004-237; University of Minnesota Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship",,,4,4,5,24,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Both species exert a detrimental effect on fish community structure directly via predation on fish eggs and indirectly via alterations of food webs. While the impact of N. melanostomus is widely documented, P. semilunaris receives little attention and its effect on aquatic communities has not yet been quantified. We compared aspects of their predation on common carp Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758 larvae at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C using the functional response (FR) approach, which has been developed and applied to forecast invader impact. Intra-specific comparison showed no significant temperature dependency on assessed FR parameters, attack rate and handling time, suggesting broad temperature tolerance of both tested predators. Proterorhinus semilunaris demonstrated a marginally higher attack rate at 20 degrees C compared to N. melanostomus. The handling times did not differ between predators. Proterorhinus semilunaris showed a lower maximum feeding rate at 25 degrees C compared to the rest of treatments suggesting lower temperature optima compared to N. melanostomus.

They have resulted in enormous ecological and economic consequences worldwide, and they are among the greatest threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, has caused great ecological influence since it was introduced to China over 30 years ago. According to supervised classification and visual interpretation of three remote-sensing images (2002, 2006 and 2010), we attained the spatial population distribution of S. alterniflora in Xiangshan Bay, Ningbo, Zhejiang province. To explore the topic further, dynamic change processes were also analyzed using the IDRISI software and their spatial distributions in 2010 and 2014 predicted using a CA-Markov model. It was found that compared with remote-sensing image interpretation maps in 2010 and 2013, accuracy verification yielded overall Kappa coefficients of 81.99% and 85.57% respectively, indicating a good predictive result from the CA-Markov model. Therefore, the model can be used for long-term forecasting such as determining the dynamic change processes and evolution trends of S. alterniflora in the Xiangshan area over the next 20 years. This can in turn provide guidance for effective management and control of invasive plant populations such as S. alterniflora.",,,,,,Chinese National Scientific and Technical Supporting Program [2012BAC13B02],The study was supported by the Chinese National Scientific and Technical Supporting Program (grant no. 2012BAC13B02).,,,1,1,2,25,,,,1798-6540,1818-5487,,AQUAT INVASIONS,Aquat.

These species represent a variety of life forms and are of high regional socio-economic importance. We hypothesized that different species would show different suites of traits to cope with water stress and expected to identify functional groups differing in strategies to withstand water shortage. Along a dry and a wet season, we monitored four traits reflecting above- and below-ground strategies of resource acquisition such as predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf thickness and leaf area index (LAI). We also measured two morphological traits: trunk diameter and tree height. LAI and psi(pd) were measured six times during the dry and rainy seasons, and the other traits were measured once. We identified two functional classes subdivided into two functional groups of each class. The first class included deciduous and semi-deciduous species that generally had large SLA, low leaf thickness and small-to-intermediate inter-seasonal variations in psi(pd). The second class included evergreen species of two functional groups that differ in SLA, leaf thickness and the magnitude of inter-seasonal variations of psi(pd) throughout the year.

In this study, I tested whether the invasion of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae; jackfruit) in the Neotropics was explained by its biotic stability, an intrinsic force, or by human occupation, an extrinsic force. I used an ensemble framework combining 12 ecological niche models (ENMs) and 4 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. ENMs were constructed for the pre-industrial time period in the Indo-Malaya biogeographic region, the native habitat of A. heterophyllus, and were then projected to past (last glacial maximum, 21000 years ago and mid-Holocene, 6000 years ago) and future (end of century, 2080) periods. The ENMs were used to establish the biotic stability of A. heterophyllus in areas where it was predicted to be present concomitantly within these four time periods. This biotic stability was projected onto the Neotropics, and then I used a null model and logistic regression to test what the main driver of A. heterophyllus invasion. In general, the presence of A. heterophyllus in the Neotropics was not explained by biotic stability, tested by the null model. However, human occupation explained much of its presence in the invaded habitat, once all standardized coefficients related to this driver was significant positive in the logistic regression. Based on these results, humans sustained the presence of A. heterophyllus in the Neotropics, probably because of the additive influences of propagule pressure and habitat disturbance. Thus, the recommendation is that the cultivation of A. heterophyllus in the Neotropics must be regulated and supervised, primarily near reserve areas.",,,,"de Oliveira, Guilherme/S-1531-2019",,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [442103/2014-0],This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [grant number 442103/2014-0].

Theoretical models often take the form of dynamical equations that comprise the ecological processes (e.g. competition, predation) believed to govern system dynamics. The inverse of this approach-inferring which processes and ecological interactions drive observed dynamics-remains an open problem in ecology. Here, we propose a way to attack this problem using a machine learning method known as symbolic regression, which seeks to discover relationships in time-series data and to express those relationships using dynamical equations. We found that this method could rapidly discover models that explained most of the variance in three classic demographic time series. More importantly, it reverse: engineered the models previously proposed by theoretical ecologists to describe these time series, capturing the core ecological processes these models describe and their functional forms.

Fully 40% of species were mast fruiting species. The seasonal timing and inter-annual variation in fruiting were unrelated to seed dispersal mode across species.

However, species' ability to reach potentially suitable areas is also critical for species survival. These range-shift' abilities can be studied using life-history traits related to four range-shift stages: emigration, movement, establishment, and proliferation. Here, we use the extent to which species' ranges fill the climatically suitable area available (range filling') as a proxy for the ability of European mammals and birds to shift their ranges under climate change. We detect which traits associate most closely with range filling. Drawing comparisons with a recent analysis for plants, we ask whether the latitudinal position of species' ranges supports the assertion that post-glacial range-shift limitations cause disequilibrium between ranges and climate. We also disentangle which of the three taxonomic groups has greatest range filling. For mammals, generalists and early-reproducing species have the greatest range filling. For birds, generalist species with high annual fecundity, which live longer than expected based on body size, have the greatest range filling. Although we consider traits related to the four range-shift stages, only traits related to establishment and proliferation ability significantly influence range filling of mammals and birds. Species with the greatest range filling are those whose range centroid falls in the latitudinal centre of Europe, suggesting that post-glacial range expansion is a leading cause of disequilibrium with climate, although other explanations are also possible. Range filling of plants is lower than that of mammals or birds, suggesting that plants are more range-limited by non-climatic factors. Therefore, plants might be face greater non-climatic restraints on range shifts than mammals or birds.",,,,"Morales-Castilla, Ignacio/AAB-2649-2019; ESTRADA, ALBA/A-9632-2018; Meireles, Catarina/Y-3760-2019","Morales-Castilla, Ignacio/0000-0002-8570-9312; ESTRADA, ALBA/0000-0003-2727-1970; ","ERA-Net BiodivERsA; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BIODIVERSA/0003/2011]; Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales, Spain [1098/2014]; Fonds de Recherches du Quebec - Nature et Technologies (FQRNT) programme; Harvard Univ","This research was funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA, with the national funder FCT, through the project BIODIVERSA/0003/2011.

These transitions are hard to forecast but theory suggests that early warning indicators can predict impending regime shifts that may allow for management intervention to prevent or mitigate an unwanted change. The efficacy of early warning indicators has been demonstrated in modeling and laboratory experiments, but rarely in the field, where environmental drivers are numerous and interacting. It is unclear if early warning indicators are observable or timely enough to allow for intervention under these conditions. We performed six whole-lake experimental nutrient additions to test the utility of early warning indicators for predicting the regime shift from a clear-water state to a cyanobacteria-dominated state. The lakes were monitored for increases in resilience indicators including rises in standard deviation and autocorrelation of algal pigments and dissolved oxygen saturation. A statistical method, quickest detection, determined when resilience indicators in manipulated lakes deviated substantially from those in a reference ecosystem. Blooms occurred in five of the six lake-years. Although there was substantial variability in bloom size and timing, at least one indicator foreshadowed the peak chlorophyll a concentration in all instances. Early warnings occurred 1-57 d prior to a bloom, which in some instances, may allow managers to notify the public or intervene to prevent blooms. The resilience indicators generally identified changes in resilience over time within a lake and also ranked large differences in resilience among lakes. Our findings suggest that resilience indicators can be useful for classifying ecosystems on a landscape and across time with respect to proximity to a critical threshold.",,,,"Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020; Cole, Jonathan J/G-4566-2011","Cole, Jonathan J/0000-0003-4633-7402; Buelo, Cal/0000-0001-7909-1440; Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249","National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology awards [1144624, 1144683]","We thank Robert Johnson, Loretta Anderson, Devon Brown, Colin Dassow, Charles Hanley, Tori Klotz, Shannon Long, Rachel Meulman, Jonathan Torre, Anders Uppgaard, and Joshua Whelan for assistance with data collection.

This intensification of the rainfall regime is expected to alter near-surface water availability, which will affect plant performance and carbon uptake. This could be especially important in peatland systems, where large stores of carbon are tightly coupled to water surpluses limiting decomposition. Here, we examined the role of precipitation frequency on vegetation growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) balances for communities dominated by a Sphagnum moss, a sedge, and an ericaceous shrub in a cool temperate poor fen. Field plots and laboratory monoliths received one of three rainfall frequency treatments, ranging from one event every three days to one event every 14 days, while total rain delivered in a two-week cycle and the entire season to each treatment remained the same. Separating incident rain into fewer but larger events increased vascular cover in all peatland communities: vascular plant cover increased 6x in the moss-dominated plots, nearly doubled in the sedge plots, and tripled in the shrub plots in Low-Frequency relative to High-Frequency treatments. Gross ecosystem productivity was lowest in moss communities receiving low-frequency rain, but higher in sedge and shrub communities under the same conditions. Net ecosystem exchange followed this pattern: fewer events with longer dry periods increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the moss while vascular plant-dominated communities became more of a sink for CO2. Results of this study suggest that changes to rainfall frequency already occurring and predicted to continue will lead to increased vascular plant cover in peatlands and will impact their carbon-sink function.",,,,,"Duval, Tim/0000-0002-7494-2709",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [418197],"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 418197",,,11,11,7,53,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

For ectotherms such as lizards, the importance of behavioural thermoregulation in avoiding thermal extremes is well-established and is increasingly acknowledged in modern studies of climate warming and its impacts. Less appreciated and understood are the buffering roles of retreat sites and activity phase, in part because of logistical challenges of studying below-ground activity. Burrowing and nocturnal activity are key behavioural adaptations that have enabled a diverse range of reptiles to survive extreme environmental temperatures within hot desert regions. Yet, the direct impact of recent global warming on activity potential has been hypothesised to have caused extinctions in desert lizards, including the Australian arid zone skink Liopholis kintorei. 2. We test the relevance of this hypothesis through a detailed characterisation of the above-and below-ground thermal and hydric microclimates available to, and used by, L. kintorei. 3. We integrate operative temperatures with observed body temperatures to construct daily activity budgets, including the inference of subterranean behaviour. We then assess the likelihood that contemporary and future local extinctions in this species, and those of similar burrowing habits, could be explained by the direct effects of warming on its activity budget and exposure to thermal extremes. 4. We found that L. kintorei spent only 4% of its time active on the surface, primarily at dusk, and that overall potential surface activity will be increased, not restricted, with climate warming. The burrow system provides an exceptional buffer to current and future maximum extremes of temperature (approximate to 40 degrees C reduction from potential surface temperatures), and desiccation (burrows near 100% humidity). Therefore, any climate warming impacts on this species are likely to be indirect. 5. Our findings reflect the general buffering capacity of underground microclimates, therefore, our conclusions for L. kintorei are more generally applicable to nocturnal and crepuscular ectotherms, and highlight the need to consider the buffering properties of retreat sites and activity phase when forecasting climate change impacts.",,,,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Stow, Adam/0000-0002-6796-4854",Australia and Pacific Science Foundation,Australia and Pacific Science Foundation,,,8,8,3,46,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Healthy soils are crucial for sustainable food production, but tillage limits the biological regulation of essential ecosystem services. Better understanding of the mechanisms driving management effects on soil ecosystem engineers is needed to support sustainable management under environmental change. 2. This paper presents the Energy-Environment-Earthworm (EEEworm) model, a mechanistic individual-based model of Lumbricus terrestris populations. Lumbricus terrestris is a dominant earthworm species in undisturbed habitats and is closely associated with numerous ecosystem services such as water flow regulation, soil structure and crop production. In reduced tillage agriculture, a decline in mechanical disturbance allows for L. terrestris proliferation, whilst the activities of L. terrestris can replace many of the soil functions provided by tillage. 3. Extensive EEEworm validation with eight published studies (average R-2 = .84) demonstrates a mechanistic approach which can extrapolate between diverse soil, management and weather conditions. EEEworm simulation experiments elucidate that a combination of direct and indirect tillage effects leads to population declines in tilled fields, with litter removal from the soil surface being the main driver. 4. We investigate the effects of different tillage intensities under historical and projected soil warming conditions and find that future warmer and drier soils in our simulation exacerbate the effects of deep ploughing on L. terrestris population declines. These effects result from warmer and drier soil conditions increasing individual metabolic rates and tillage reducing food availability to meet energy demands. 5. Synthesis and applications. Pre-emptive strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on soil health in agroecosystems should focus on decreasing tillage intensity and retention of crop residues following tillage. Energy-Environment-Earthworm (EEEworm) has the potential to benefit land managers, policy makers, risk assessors and regulators by providing a tool to forecast how soil systems respond to combinations of land management and environmental change. To allow better cost-benefit analysis of contrasting land management systems, a future aim of mechanistic models like EEEworm is to incorporate the links between earthworm populations, soil functions and ecosystem services.",,,,,"Johnston, Alice Sophie Alexandra/0000-0001-8781-4039",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N019504/1]; NERC Soil Security Programme [NE/N019504/1],"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/N019504/1; NERC Soil Security Programme, Grant/Award Number: NE/N019504/1",,,6,7,12,45,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

After decades of extensive surveying, knowledge of the global distribution of species still remains inadequate for many purposes. In the short to medium term, such knowledge is unlikely to improve greatly given the often prohibitive costs of surveying and the typically limited resources available. 2. By forecasting biodiversity patterns in time and space, predictive models can help fill critical knowledge gaps and prioritise research to support better conservation and management. 3. The ability of a model to predict biodiversity metrics in novel environments is termed ""transferability,"" and models with high transferability will be the most useful in this context. 4. Despite their potentially broad utility, little guidance exists on what confers high transferability to biodiversity models. 5. We synthesise recent advances in biodiversity model transfers to facilitate increased understanding of what underpins successful model transferability, demonstrating that a consistent approach has so far been lacking but is essential for achieving high levels of repeatability, transparency and accountability of model transfers. 6.

Altered precipitation patterns may change important ecosystem functions like decomposition through either changes in physical and chemical processes or shifts in the activity and/or composition of species. We experimentally manipulated hydroperiods (length of wet:dry cycles) in a tank bromeliad ecosystem to examine impacts on leaf litter decomposition. Gross loss of litter mass over 112 days was greatest in continuously submersed litter, lowest in continuously dry litter, and intermediate over a range of hydroperiods ranging from eight cycles of 7 wet:7 dry days to one cycle of 56 wet:56 dry days. The resilience of litter mass loss to hydroperiod length is due to a shift from biologically assisted decomposition (mostly microbial) at short wet:dry hydroperiods to physicochemical release of dissolved organic matter at longer wet:dry hydroperiods. Biologically assisted decomposition was maximized at wet:dry hydroperiods falling within the range of ambient conditions (12-22 consecutive dry days) but then declined under prolonged wet:dry hydroperiods (28 and 56 dry days. Fungal:bacterial ratios showed a similar pattern as biologically assisted decomposition to hydroperiod length. Our results suggest that microbial communities confer functional resilience to altered hydroperiod in tank bromeliad ecosystems. We predict a substantial decrease in biological activity relevant to decomposition under climate scenarios that increase consecutive dry days by 1.6- to 3.2-fold in our study area, whereas decreased frequency of dry periods will tend to increase the physicochemical component of decomposition.",,,,"Leroy, Celine/I-4857-2016","Leroy, Celine/0000-0003-4859-8040; Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544","Agence Nationale de la Recherche throughout the Rainwebs projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-BSV7-0022-01]; ""Investissement d'Avenir"" Grant (Labex CEBA)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]; CNRS Grant","We thank the members of the Laboratoire Environnement de Petit Saut (HYDRECO) for technical support and the use of their facilities, and A.
