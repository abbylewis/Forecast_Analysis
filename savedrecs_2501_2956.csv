An overview of the project and it's achievements to date are presented in an accompanying paper at this conference, Betts et al. (2005a) A significant physical component of the river system covered by this DSS is the hydraulically complex Dongting Lakes system. This lake system represents a significant challenge for flood prediction in a real time context. For this reason, advanced hydraulic analysis techniques have been utilised in an effort to gain a better understanding of the hydraulic behaviour of this complex lake system and it's interaction with the Yangtze River. Investigations have been undertaken in two broad areas, these being detailed two dimensional modelling of the hydraulics of the extensive lake systems, and detailed, two dimensional modelling of the processes associated with the flooding of detention basins adjoining the lake systems. This paper provides a brief overview of the detailed investigations of the Dongting Lakes and their relationship to the overall Yangtze River System as part of the YRFCMP. A description of the modelling systems, their calibration and the subsequent use of results in the Flood Forecasting and Options Analysis Systems is also presented.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-7-80621-999-7,,,,2005,,,,,,,103,111,,,,,,"Ecology; Engineering, Civil; Water Resources",,,WOS:000260656100015,,,,,

In this paper we discuss the use of the relative (actual/potential) evapotranspiration for agricultural drought monitoring. It is shown that the relative evapotranspiration is not very well related to soil water content. However, as the relative evapotranspiration appears closely related to crop production, it is an excellent indicator of agricultural drought. The ""evapotranspiration drought index"" (EDI) is proposed. The EDI equals the 2 - monthly averaged relative evapotranspiration. During the growing season the EDI provides a first estimate of crop production losses due to drought.

The 191 nations, including 82 heads of state, participating in the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg agreed to a plan of implementation (POI) that encourages nations to apply the ecosystem approach to marine resource assessment and management practices by 2010, and maintain or restore fish stocks to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield levels by 2015. To achieve these targets will require an improved understanding and assessment of the effects of physical, biological and human forcing causing changes in biomass yields of large marine ecosystems (LMEs). An international financial mechanism, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is assisting developing countries in meeting the Summit targets by supporting LME assessment and management projects. Of the 29 LMEs for which published case study information is available for analyses of principal forces driving changes in biomass yields, fishing effort was the primary forcing mechanism in 14 LMEs; climate forcing was the principal factor in 13 LMEs, eutrophication in one case and the data were inconclusive in another. Fishing effort was a secondary driver of change in biomass yields in the LMEs driven by climate forcing. Mitigating actions for reducing fishing effort to promote recovery of lost biomass yield is proving successful in one case study. Actions for improving forecasts of oceanographic conditions affecting fish stocks are underway in four GEF supported LME projects (e.g. Humboldt Current, Canary Current, Guinea Current, Benguela Current); measures to assess and manage excessive fishing effort are planned for 8 LME projects, eutrophication reduction and control in another, and 6 LMEs with relatively stable decadal biomass yields appear suitable for mandating precautionary total allowable catch (TAC) levels.

Forecast accuracy, or the perceived lack of forecast accuracy, is cited as a key impediment to the uptake of forecast information in decision-making despite the efforts of researchers to statistically validate forecast systems. One potential reason why accuracy remains an impediment is that decision-makers are not only concerned with statistical validity from a climatological perspective, but also with how accurately a forecast predicts impacts on variables of interest from their perspective. This paper examines this issue using a case study approach from eastern Australia to show that a forecast. which is acceptable from a climatological perspective, does not necessarily transfer into a useable forecast for decision-makers. The results show that expected outcomes differ considerably from outcomes generated using a perfect forecast. These unintended outcomes can decrease the potential for a forecast to be useful to decision-makers. It is concluded that forecast research needs to address forecast accuracy from a truer perspective to facilitate the adoption of forecast information in decision-making.

This conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation creates a conundrum for conservation biologists because traditional forms of conservation action require money. We hypothesize that conservation spending in the United States is highly correlated with income and wealth, and we tested whether selected proxies for U.S. conservation activity could be predicted by U.S. economic indicators over time scales of 7-71 years. Stock market indexes (Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor's 500 Index), gross domestic product (GDP), and personal income (PI) explained as much as 99% of annual variation in total revenue (including contributions) to four large nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the World Wildlife Fund, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, The Nature Conservancy. These broad economic indicators also explained as much as 96% of the annual number of university conservation programs, 83% of membership in professional conservation organizations (Natural Areas Association, Society for Conservation Biology), 93% of natural park visitation, and 99+% of national park acreage. In most analyses, the income variables GDP and PI explained more variation in conservation activity than did either of the stock-market wealth variables. After long-term growth was removed from the time series, changes in revenues to the four NGOs combined were significantly correlated with GDP but not PI over the short term. Short-term variation in park acreage was significantly correlated with GDP and PI but lagged both by 3 years. Using linear models based on GDP, we predicted increases of 2.3% in 2003 cumulative NGO revenues and 1.0% in 2006 acreage owned by the National Park Service. The conservation activity parameters we measured may exhibit positive trends even in the face of declining biodiversity, but biodiversity conservation will ultimately require the cessation of economic growth.

Here we report on the first empirical assessment of their reliability by using a retrospective study of 18 pairs of bird and mammal species (one species extinct and the other extant) with eight different assessors. The performance of individual assessors varied substantially, but performance was improved by incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and consensus among the assessors. When this was done, the ranks from the protocols were consistent with the extinction outcome in 70-80% of pairs and there were mismatches in only 10-20% of cases. This performance was similar to the subjective judgements of the assessors after they had estimated the range and population parameters required by the protocols, and better than any single parameter. When used to inform subjective judgement, the protocols therefore offer a means of reducing unpredictable biases that may be associated with expert input and have the advantage of making the logic behind assessments explicit. We conclude that the protocols are useful for forecasting extinctions, although they are prone to some errors that have implications for conservation. Some level of error is to be expected, however, given the influence of chance on extinction. The performance of risk assessment protocols may be improved by providing training in the application of the protocols, incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and using consensus among multiple assessors, including some who are experts in the application of the protocols.

Several studies have shown that climate changes over the latter part of the 20th century affected the phenology and population dynamics of single species. However, the key limitation to forecasting the effects of changing climate on ecosystems lies in understanding how it will affect interactions among species. We investigated the effects of climatic and biotic drivers on physical and biological lake processes, using a historical dataset of 40 years from Lake Washington, USA, and dynamic time-series models to explain changes in the phenological patterns among physical and biological components of pelagic ecosystems. Long-term climate warming and variability because of large-scale climatic patterns like Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) extended the duration of the stratification period by 25 days over the last 40 years. This change was due mainly to earlier spring stratification (16 days) and less to later stratification termination in fall (9 days). The phytoplankton spring bloom advanced roughly in parallel to stratification onset and in 2002 it occurred about 19 days earlier than it did in 1962, indicating the tight connection of spring phytoplankton growth to turbulent conditions. In contrast, the timing of the clear-water phase showed high variability and was mainly driven by biotic factors. Among the zooplankton species, the timing of spring peaks in the rotifer Keratella advanced strongly, whereas Leptodiaptomus and Daphnia showed slight or no changes. These changes have generated a growing time lag between the spring phytoplankton peak and zooplankton peak, which can be especially critical for the cladoceran Daphnia. Water temperature, PDO, and food availability affected the timing of the spring peak in zooplankton. Overall, the impact of PDO on the phenological processes were stronger compared with ENSO. Our results highlight that climate affects physical and biological processes differently, which can interrupt energy flow among trophic levels, making ecosystem responses to climate change difficult to forecast.",,,,,,,,,,246,255,9,198,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

There is often considerable uncertainty associated with these predictions. However, alternatives to predictions based on population models have not been assessed. We used simulation models of hypothetical species to generate the kinds of data that might typically be available to ecologists and then invited other researchers to predict risks of population declines using these data. The accuracy of the predictions was assessed by comparison with the forecasts of the original model. The researchers used either population models or subjective judgement to make their predictions. Predictions made using models were only slightly more accurate than subjective judgements of risk. However, predictions using models tended to be unbiased, while subjective judgements were biased towards over-estimation. Psychology literature suggests that the bias of subjective judgements is likely to vary somewhat unpredictably among people, depending on their stake in the outcome.

The first documented large-scale coral bleaching occurred in the Hawaii region during late summer of 1996, with a second in 2002. The bleaching events in Hawaii were triggered by a prolonged regional positive oceanic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly greater than 1degreesC that developed offshore during the time of annual summer temperature maximum. High solar energy input and low winds further elevated inshore water temperature by 1-2degreesC in reef areas with restricted water circulation (bays, reef flats and lagoons) and in areas where mesoscale eddies often retain water masses close to shore for prolonged periods of time. Data and observations taken during these events illustrate problems in predicting the phenomena of large-scale bleaching. Forecasts and hind-casts of these events are based largely on offshore oceanic SST records, which are only a first approximation of inshore reef conditions. The observed oceanic warming trend is the ultimate cause of the increase in the frequency and severity of bleaching events. However, coral reefs occur in shallow inshore areas where conditions are influenced by winds, orographic cloud cover, complex bathymetry, waves and inshore currents.

Although free-ranging ungulates have been studied extensively in North America, relatively little is known about the field behavior of hunters or the factors that influence hunting behavior, except on small study areas where access is limited and controlled. We developed 3 integrated protocols to estimate hunter density, distribution, movements, habitat use, characteristics, and attitudes, which can be used on large areas with unrestricted access. We described how aerial surveys, in conjunction with distance sampling techniques and a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of landscape characteristics, provide estimates of hunter density and a map of hunter distribution and habitat use. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) units issued to hunters to systematically record hunter locations. Hunters also completed a simple questionnaire. We linked these data and used them to obtain detailed information on habitat use, movements, and activity patterns. Whereas aerial surveys are limited to discrete points in time and relate only to aggregations of hunters, data collected on hunters that carry GPS units can be used to study habitat use and distribution at different times of day for individual hunters. Finally, linked responses from a traditional mail or telephone survey to hunter location data collected via GPS units to assess how hunter characteristics (e.g., age, physical condition, attitudes) were related to field behavior. We applied these techniques during a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting season on a large tract (45,749 ha) of public land in Pennsylvania, USA, with unrestricted hunter access. We estimated density of 7 hunters/1,000 ha (95% CI: 4.2 to 10.3) in the morning and 6.3 hunters/1,000 ha (95% CI: 3.5 to 10.0) in the afternoon. We found that hunter density was negatively related to distance from roads and slope. Most hunters preferred stand hunting, especially in the early morning hours (0600-0800 hr; 72% stationary); more walked or stalked in the afternoon (1400-1600 hr; 58% stationary). The average maximum distance hunters reached from a road open to public vehicles was 0.84 km (SE = 0.03), and they walked an average of 5.48 km (SE = 0.193) during their daily hunting activities. We believe that the approaches we used for studying hunter behavior will be useful for understanding the connections between hunter attitudes and behavior and hence will allow managers to predict hunter response to changes in harvest regulations. Furthermore, our methods are more accurate than requesting hunters to self-report where they hunted. For example, we found that hunters reported that they walked >2.5 times farther from the nearest road ((x) over bar = 2.23 km, SE = 0.13) than actual distance recorded via GPS units ((x) over bar = 0.84 km, SE = 0.03). Our research provides wildlife managers with new knowledge on several levels. At the most basic level, we learned a great deal about what hunters actually do while in the field, rather than simply what they report. Second, linking field behavior with hunter characteristics will provide insights into the likely effects of changing hunter demographics. Finally, linking these data with traditional human-dimensions research topics, such as attitudes toward hunting regulations, may allow managers to better forecast the potential effects of regulation changes on hunter distribution and effort.",,,,,,,,,,49,51,0,57,,,,0022-541X,1937-2817,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

While the heuristics of 'pulses', 'triggers' and 'reserves' are intuitive and thus appealing, the value of the paradigm is limited, both as a conceptual model of how pulsed water inputs are translated into primary production and as a framework for developing quantitative models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a revision of the pulse-reserve model that emphasizes the following: (1) what explicitly constitutes a biologically significant 'rainfall pulse', (2) how do rainfall pulses translate into usable 'soil moisture pulses', and (3) how are soil moisture pulses differentially utilized by various plant functional types (FTs) in terms of growth? We explore these questions using the patch and lands simulation (PALS) model for sites in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. Our analyses indicate that rainfall variability is best understood in terms of sequences of rainfall events that produce biologically-significant 'pulses' of soil moisture recharge, as opposed to individual rain events. In the desert regions investigated, biologically significant pulses of soil moisture occur in either winter (October-March) or summer (July September), as determined by the period of activity of the plant FTs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding specific growth responses to moisture pulses, because of the strong effects of and interactions between precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and plant FT responses, all of which vary among deserts and seasons. Our results further suggest that, in most soil types and in most seasons, there is little separation of soil water with depth. Thus, coexistence of plant FTs in a single patch as examined in this PALS study is likely to be fostered by factors that promote: (1) separation of water use over time (seasonal differences in growth), (2) relative differences in the utilization of water in the upper soil layers, or (3) separation in the responses of plant FTs as a function of preceding conditions, i.e., the physiological and morphological readiness of the plant for water-uptake and growth. Finally, the high seasonal and annual variability in soil water recharge and plant growth, which result from the complex interactions that occur as a result of rainfall variability, antecedent soil moisture conditions, nutrient availability, and plant FT composition and cover, call into question the use of simplified vegetation models in forecasting potential impacts of climate change in the and zones in North America.",,,,"Reynolds, James F/G-6364-2010","Fernandez, Roberto/0000-0003-3094-569X",,,,,434,491,3,188,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2004,141,2,,,,,194,210,,10.1007/s00442-004-1524-4,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000224528200002,15042457,,,,

Most of the current models do not include differences in local stream characteristics and effects on the biota. To define the most important variables that should be used in a stream eutrophication model, the literature was reviewed. Increased nutrient concentrations can cause toxicity (by high concentrations of ammonia or nitrite), which directly affects the functioning of organisms in the ecosystem. Indirect effects take place via two main processes, primary production and decomposition which can both be stimulated by an increase of the nutrient concentrations. If there are no regulating mechanisms, a higher production rate can cause an increase in algal biomass. But often secondary production and in some cases even the number of predators also increases. This means that effects of nutrient enrichment become visible throughout the whole food web. The effects on community level are shown by changes in species composition and densities. A higher algal biomass could also cause oxygen depletion, which has a direct effect on macrofauna and fish. Important for the extent of the eutrophication effects is the amount of nutrients that is withdrawn from the water column by the ecosystem. All these mechanisms are strongly influenced by the local characteristics of the stream. That is why first of all the sensitivity of a stream to eutrophication depends on the regional stream characteristics. A model developed for a certain stream type and region is in many cases not applicable to other stream types or regions. Therefore, local stream characteristics should be included if the model should be more generally applicable. In conclusion: Stream eutrophication models should combine relationships between nutrient input, nutrient uptake versus transport, and their effects on the biotic community. It should include relationships between regional stream characteristics and the expected extent of the eutrophication effects (the sensitivity of a stream for eutrophication). Models that include all these factors are not yet available but there are many models which focus on only a part of these processes. Some of these parts can be used to fill in a complete stream eutrophication model. However, because of differences between stream types and regions these parts should first be tested for their applicability to the stream type and region of interest. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Contemporary methods of assessing biodiversity are briefly reviewed and focus on the relative roles of the Linnean species and plant functional types (PFTs). Recent case studies from central Sumatra and northern Thailand indicate how the range distributions of many plant and animal species and functional types frequently extend along regional gradients of light, water and nutrient availability and corresponding land use intensity. We show that extending the sampling context to include a broader array of environmental determinants of biodiversity results in a more interpretable pattern of biodiversity. Our results indicate sampling within a limited environmental context has the potential to generate highly truncated range distributions and thus misleading information for land managers and for conservation. In an intensive, multi-taxa survey in lowland Sumatra, vegetational data were collected along a land use intensity gradient using a proforma specifically designed for rapid survey. Each vegetation sample plot was a focal point for faunal survey. Whereas biodiversity pattern from samples within closed canopy rain forest was difficult to interpret, extending the sample base to include a wider variety of land cover and land use greatly improved interpretation of plant and animal distribution. Apart from providing an improved theoretical and practical basis for forecasting land use impact on biodiversity, results illustrate how specific combinations of plant-based variables might be used to predict impacts on specific animal taxa, functional types and above-ground carbon. Implications for regional assessment and monitoring of biodiversity and in improving understanding of the landscape dynamics are briefly discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The calibrated model explained 81.2% of the total variation in the interpolated data. Calibration results indicated that rainfall and temperature influenced each rate and affected adults and juveniles differently. Juvenile mortality appeared to be only affected by temperature, whilst the juvenile recruitment rate and the rate of adult mortality were found to be more dependent upon rainfall. The model was then simulated over a three and a half year period for comparison with the interpolated data for the same period. Qualitative changes in the interpolated slug abundance were well described by the model.

Although current fire management focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings back to their historical ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant influence on area burned and fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited to short-term predictions of fire weather but increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict climatic variability at seasonal to annual leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some regions, have been difficult to establish in others. Increased temperature in the future will likely extend fire seasons throughout the western United States, with more fires occurring earlier and later than is currently typical, and will increase the total area burned in some regions. If climatic change increases the amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather we can expect significant changes in the distribution and abundance of dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant and animal species. Some species that are sensitive to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and abundance of species favored by fire may be enhanced.

Models predict that predation should mitigate species responses to environmental change, and that interspecific competition should aggravate species responses to environmental change. To test this prediction, we studied how predation and competition affected the responses of two ciliates, Colpidiumstriatum and Parameciumtetraurelia, to temperature change in laboratory microcosms. We found that neither predation nor competition altered the responses of Colpidiumstriatum to temperature change, and that competition but not predation altered the responses of Paramecium tetraurelia to temperature change. Asymmetric interactions and temperature-dependent interactions may have contributed to the disparity between model predictions and experimental results.

Quantifying range filling (R/P) as realized/potential range size ratios using bioclimatic envelope modelling we find mean R/P = 38.3% (+/-30.3% SD). Many European tree species naturalize extensively outside their native ranges, providing support for interpreting the many low R/Ps as primarily reflecting dispersal limitation. R/P increases strongly with latitudinal range centroid and secondarily with hardiness and decreases weakly with longitudinal range centroid. Hence, European tree species ranges appear strongly controlled by geographical dispersal constraints on post-glacial expansion as well as climate.

Recent attempts to predict invasions have focused on the supply of propagules of nonindigenous species to recipient ecosystems from source populations. Here we develop a spatially explicit ""gravity"" model to test this concept for Bythotrephes longimanus, a crustacean waterflea from Eurasia that is rapidly invading lakes in Ontario, Canada. The gravity model predicted spread of Bythotrephes based upon seven identified risk factors (e.g., use of contaminated fishing or boat anchor line) that may allow dispersal of either live individuals or their resting eggs from invaded to noninvaded lakes, as well as based on the spatial arrangement of invaded and noninvaded lakes in Ontario. Discriminant analysis of lake gravity scores successfully identified invasion status for 74% of 170 inland lakes. A retrospective analysis of 31 invaded lakes revealed that the order in which lakes were invaded was directly related to the magnitude of vector inflows from invaded sources. Analysis of the dominant vector inflow to each invaded lake revealed a ""stepping stone"" pattern in which at least five lakes were sequentially invaded from the source population in Lake Huron. One invaded lake (Muskoka) apparently served as an invasion ""hub,"" resulting in up to 18 additional direct and 17 indirect invasions. Species spread occurred via a combination of dominant, local diffusion (median distance 12.5 km) and rare, long-distance (>100 km) dispersal. Eleven of 131 lakes that were not invaded in 2000 were reported invaded in 2001. Gravity scores of these lakes were significantly higher than those of other noninvaded systems, indicating that susceptibility to invasion can be related to the magnitude of vector inflows. A GIS model based on gravity scores indicated that distribution of Bythotrephes is expected to expand to eastern and northwestern Ontario, although most new invasions are expected to occur in the central region of the province. Our results indicate that quantitative analysis of human dispersal vectors provides a robust starting point with which to assess vulnerability of discrete ecosystems to invasion. Management efforts focused on reducing the number and magnitude of human-mediated dispersal vectors may reduce the rate of invasion of new ecosystems.",,,,"macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020","Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662",,,,,92,95,0,38,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We have used a variety of analytical tools to examine a 45-year time series of annual censuses of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) in the Gran Paradiso National Park in northwestern Italy. This ibex population grew from about 3300 to almost 5000 individuals in the 1980s during a decade of anomalously mild winters, and then began to decline in the 1990s. By 1997, the population size had returned to previous levels. Adult survival apparently increased and adult sex ratio may have changed to slightly favor males during the increase in population density. Yearly changes in total population were correlated with seasonal average snow depth and population density over the 39 years for which climate data were available. Our results show that the ibex population size was limited by both density dependence and deep snow. A model based on these factors fit to the first 19 years of data was used to forecast subsequent changes in total population based on initial population size and yearly snow depth. The model was able to predict the increase and subsequent decline in total population size over the final 20 years of the study but failed to reproduce population levels after the eruption.

In order to prevent invasions and target monitoring efforts most effectively, we need to forecast locations at the greatest risk of new invasions. To accomplish this, we need to estimate propagule pressure (inoculum size) and consider population processes, including possible Allee effects. Here, we develop a method to estimate the probability of population establishment, based on survival analysis and maximum likelihood techniques. We demonstrate theoretically the validity of this approach, considering environmental heterogeneity, estimation error, and nonlinearity. We then apply this method to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasions of Michigan inland lakes. We fit our model using presence/absence data for 1589 lakes between 1992 and 1996 and propagule pressure estimates from gravity models of boater traffic. Using our fitted model, we estimated the probabilities of establishment and demonstrated that Allee effects were present in the zebra mussel system. We validated our model using invasion data from 1997-2001 (data not used to parameterize the model). For the validation time period, we correctly predicted up to nine times as many invasions as a null (random) model. Further, the Allee model assigned average probabilities of invasion four times higher for lakes that became invaded than for uninvaded, lakes, whereas the non-Allee model predicted probabilities for invaded lakes only two times higher. Thus, our model demonstrates the importance of considering the Allee effect and improves predictions of invasions.",,,,"Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235",,,,,157,165,0,77,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2004,85,6,,,,,1651,1660,,10.1890/02-0571,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000222727500025,,,,,

We need to understand the mechanisms through which populations respond to environmental conditions, to predict when or if established relationships, used as management tools to forecast recruitment strength, might break down completely. Identifying characteristics of successful recruits who have grown under different environmental scenarios may improve our understanding of the mechanistic connections between environmental conditions and the temporal variation in life history characteristics that ultimately affect recruitment. This 5-year study sought to determine the association between key life history characteristics of southern calamary Sepioteuthis australis (growth rate, body size, and patterns of repro-somatic energy allocation) and the environmental conditions experienced by individuals on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. Among years, all population and individual parameters examined were highly variable, despite the environmental regime during the study not encompassing the extremes that may occur in this dynamic region. Temperature was not clearly associated with any of the individual or population differences observed. Populations of apparently similar abundance were composed of individuals with strikingly different biological characteristics, therefore seeking relationships between abundance and environmental parameters at gross levels did not shed light on the mechanisms responsible for population size. Importantly, inter-annual differences in squid size, condition, reproductive investment, and possibly growth rate, were sex-specific, indicating that males and females responded differently to similar factors. Among years differences in body size were extreme, both among the male component of the population and between genders. The relative importance of many size-based processes that contribute to population size and structure (e.show $132#g. predation, starvation, competition, and reproductive success) will therefore vary inter-annually.",,,,"Moltschaniwskyj, Natalie/D-2048-2012; Moltschaniwskyj, Natalie/AAB-7236-2019; Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011","Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Moltschaniwskyj, Natalie/0000-0001-9709-9876",,,,,49,51,2,10,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2004,139,4,,,,,515,524,,10.1007/s00442-004-1537-z,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000221235800004,15054657,,,,

This is despite the fact that traditional biogeography theory sees the geographical distribution of a species as the collective outcome of the adaptive habitat choices of individuals. Here, we integrate individual habitat choices with regional distribution through a bottom-up Geographical Information System (GIS)-based approach, by using a 9-year data set on a large avian predator, the eagle owl (Bubo bubo L.). We further examine the potential population level and biodiversity consequences of this approach. Location The study was conducted in the Trento Region (central-eastern Italian Alps) and in six other areas of the nearby Lombardia Region in the central Alps. Methods We used stepwise logistic regression to build a habitat suitability model discriminating between eagle owl territories and an equal number of random locations. The model was applied to the whole Trento region by means of a GIS so as to predict suitable habitat patches. The predicted regional distribution (presence-absence in 10-km grid quadrats) was then compared with the observed one. Furthermore, we compared estimates of biodiversity in quadrats with and without eagle owls, so as to test whether the presence of this top predator may signal macro-areas of high biodiversity. Results The logistic habitat suitability model showed that, compared with a random distribution, eagle owls selected low-elevation breeding sites with high availability of prey-rich habitats in their surroundings. Breeding performance increased with the availability of prey-rich habitats, confirming the adaptiveness of the detected habitat choices. We applied the habitat suitability model to the 6200 km(2) study region by means of a GIS and found a close fit between the observed and predicted regional distribution. Furthermore, population abundance was positively related to the availability of habitat defined as suitable by the above analyses. Finally, high biodiversity levels were associated with owl presence and with the amount of suitable owl habitat, demonstrating that modelling habitat suitability of a properly chosen indicator species may provide key conservation information at the wider ecosystem level. Main conclusions Our bottom-up modelling approach may increase the conservation-value of habitat selection models, by (1) predicting local and regional distribution, (2) estimating regional population size, (3) stimulating further hypothesis testing, (4) forecasting the population effects of future habitat loss and degradation and (5) aiding in the identification and prioritization of high-biodiversity areas.",,,,"Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773",,,,,50,53,0,39,,,,0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Naturally established seedlings were monitored in two mountain ranges, and experimental sowings were performed both in woodlands and in adjacent successional shrublands into which the forest could expand. 2 Emergence was high in all microhabitats, although it was highest under the canopy of shrubs. Overall survival was low, with c. 90% of seedlings dying in the first growing season (c. 98% after several growing seasons). Survival differed among microhabitats, being highest under shrubs and extremely low (or zero) under pines or in bare soil. 3 Seedling growth was the highest in areas of bare soil, intermediate under shrubs, and very low under pines. 4 Establishment under pines was prevented by both mortality and poor performance, and good performance cannot counteract high mortality in the open. Shrubs, however, acted as nurse plants, buffering summer drought without reducing radiation to levels critical for growth, and protecting seedlings from ungulate trampling, hail and frost heave. 5 Patterns of recruitment were similar for woodland stands and successional shrublands. In addition, patterns of survival for naturally established seedlings were similar to those of seedlings originating from experimental sowings. 6 Juveniles were positively associated with shrubs but negatively with bare soil or areas below pine canopies. The facilitative effect of shrubs on seedling survival therefore changes the spatial pattern of recruitment from that determined by germination. 7 Overall, processes controlling seedling establishment in these southern Scots pine forests differ sharply from those operating in its main distribution area.

Arguments in favor of hierarchical modeling are made, especially for considering a complex environmental issue like widespread eastern hemlock regeneration failure. We present the philosophy and basic framework for the NORTHern Woodland Dynamics Simulator (NORTHWDS) Integrated Hierarchical Model System (NIHMS). NIHMS has an individual tree component (the NORTHWDS Individual Response Model (NIRM)), a mesoscale stand simulator (NORTHWDS), and a landscape model (NORTHWDS Landscape Model (NLM, presented in another paper)). NIRM predicts the behavior of a tree given the physical and biotic environment that constrains its performance, using process-response functions at a scale larger than the individual plant. The NORTHWDS model integrates both the structure of the individual tree model (including tree growth and mortality functions) with a series of ecosystem processes (e.g. competition, site biogeochemistry, small-scale disturbance, deer browsing) and even larger scale events (e.g. catastrophic windthrow) to predict long-term stand dynamics on a 5-year simulation cycle. The boundaries in time and space between the NIRM, NORTHWDS, and NLM models are not discrete, but overlap due to the multiscale expression of ecological and physiological processes. For example, the NORTHWDS model represents both the intersection between the NIRM and NLM models with additional unique mesoscale processes (e.g. intertree competition). At the highest level of NIHMS, NLM provides the environmental context for NORTHWDS, with all levels operating in an internally consistent and parsimonious manner. Three case study scenarios are used to illustrate some of the potential applications of NIRM. Scenario 1: simulation of northern red oak survivorship, crown dynamics, diameter increment, and cumulative propagule production under different local stand densities; Scenario 2: the response of white ash along an available nitrogen gradient with respect to mortality, crown surface area, diameter growth, tree biomass, and propagule production; and Scenario 3: the survivorship and total propagule production of black spruce along a soil moisture gradient. Under Scenario 1, crown size decreased appreciably as local stand density increased from open-grown (<1 m(2)/ha) to closed canopy conditions (15-30 m(2)/ha), triggering reduced annual increment, lower established propagule production, and increased small tree mortality. Similarly, nitrogen (for white ash) and moisture (for black spruce) gradients significantly affected crown size and growth potential, with many of the same consequences as noted for increased competition in northern red oak. These predictions were consistent with ecological expectations for all scenarios except the black spruce moisture gradient response, which arose because of scale-related issues and the complexity of gradients. To evaluate NORTHWDS model behavior, a 36 ha synthetic stand resembling a hardwood-dominated forest from northern Wisconsin was simulated for 300 years using four windthrow disturbance scenarios (no windthrow, acute windthrow only, chronic windthrow only, and both types of windthrow). Acute (particularly severe but locally discrete and infrequent events) windthrow patterns were designed to generate many small, low intensity events, while chronic windthrow (pervasive yet low intensity cyclic loss of trees) losses depended on species, stature, rooting depth, and tree exposure. These scenarios were compared by examining differences in structural (i.e. biomass, tree richness) and compositional attributes for a number of key species. NORTHWDS predicted the maturation of a pole-sized aspen stand and its eventual conversion to a predominantly sugar maple forest. Quantitatively, aboveground biomass levels comparable to field data were forecast (up to 250-300 Mg/ha, depending on the scenario). The predicted dominance of sugar maple was also consistent with other regional studies, and can be attributed to its shade and browsing tolerance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The dynamics of a rocky intertidal macroalgal community were evaluated using an experimentally induced heat stress applied at the end of a 15-mo manipulation of diversity. This pulse event produced a gradient of thermal stress within plots and, consequently, different degrees of perturbation. In general, the resistance of the community to the thermal stress was forecast by the pre-stress cover of dominant species, total algal cover, and standing biomass. Because higher diversity treatments, especially those containing the dominant algal group, fucoids, had higher overall abundance, highest diversity treatments were the most severely affected. The stress was also relatively nonselective, in that species were reduced in roughly equivalent proportions, suggesting an important distinction for predicting when diversity will not influence disturbance dynamics. The resilience of the community was strongly dependent on which species were initially present in the plots and the degree of disturbance. In highly disturbed areas, although the recovery trajectory was similar in early successional stages, differences emerged later; these differences appear to be attributable to the composition of the surrounding regeneration pool. For treatments not receiving the thermal stress, low-diversity plots without fucoids remained in states unlike the reference condition for most of the monitored resilience period. But plots in high-diversity treatments, even areas within plots that had experienced moderate disturbance, returned to states similar to the reference quickly. Thus, resilience (but not resistance) results are consistent with the insurance hypothesis.

The soils included chernozem, sandy chernozem and fluvisol with a 2.0 m profile depth. Daily measurements of the soil water content were taken using TDR probes (one per 0.3 m of depth) in six replicates for each soil type. The analysis was carried out for winter wheat and spring barley grown on the site during seasons 2000 and 2001 and included a detailed comparison of the simulated and measured soil water contents as well as an analysis of seasonal soil water balances, root front velocities and an evaluation of the modeled crop yields. CERES and SWAP, in contrast to WOFOST, simulated the grain yield of barley and wheat well. All three models simulated soil water content in the profile with similar results. The root mean square error (RMSE) range of soil water content was 0.71-4.67% for barley and 2.32-6.77% for wheat, depending on the model and soil type. None of the models simulated total soil water content in the profile significantly better, but there was a general tendency for the models to overestimate soil water depletion. Both CERES and SWAP mimicked the soil water content dynamics well in the top 0.3 m of the soil. The study shows that the multiple layer approach models (SWAP or CERES) including more sophisticated estimation methods for root growth and soil water extraction should be preferred in comparable environments. Further adjustments of evapotranspiration subroutines to the local conditions should be considered prior to the model use for drought impact assessment, yield forecasting or climate change impact studies.

Moreover, it could be valuable to know what additional threats may arise from continued human population growth. Here we quantify a model of the relationship between human population density and the number of threatened mammal and bird species by nation. Our multiple regression analysis revealed that two predictor variables, human population density and species richness (of birds and mammals), account for 88% of the variability in log-transformed densities of threatened species across 114 continental nations. Using the regression model with projected population sizes of each nation, we found that the number of threatened species in the average nation is expected to increase 7% by 2020, and 14% by 2050, as forecast by human population growth alone. Our findings strongly support the notion that abating human population growth is a necessary, if not sufficient, step in the epic attempt to conserve biodiversity on the global scale.

To build on previous findings, our objective was to model the impact of annual brome grasses on soil organic carbon storage as a step towards forecasting ecological change. Specifically, we measured differences in carbon storage between patches dominated by annual bromes and perennial grasses, in addition to evaluating key plant functional characteristics that impact carbon storage. Using the CENTURY model, we simulated high- and low-brome vegetation based on differences in functional characteristics, allowing us to extrapolate the findings from the field study across a broader time scale. We sampled a prairie site in 1996 and 1997 to quantify differences between the high- and low-brome cover plots. High-brome plots averaged 40% brome cover, while the low-brome plots averaged 1% brome cover. We found differences in functional attributes for growth characteristics and litter quality, as well as minor differences in edaphic variables between the plots. Based on field measurements, more soil organic carbon was stored under high-brome vegetation than low-brome, but the differences were not statistically significant. Results from model simulations were consistent with field measurements, and suggested that this prairie ecosystem was not significantly impacted by the functional differences between high- and low-brome vegetation for the first 50 years after the brome invasion under historical management and climate. However, the model results also showed that the differences in soil organic carbon storage continue to diverge after 50 years and consequently could be significant in the future.",,,,"Ojima, Dennis/C-5272-2016","Ogle, Stephen/0000-0003-1899-7446",,,,,22,22,0,20,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

To assess possible responses of this group we examine the physiology and ecology of coccolithophores with regard to expected environmental changes.

Here we develop analytic approximations to explore the relationship between the proportion of variation in annual recruitment that can be predicted and the expected annual harvest yield arising from fixed escapement harvesting methods. Simulations suggest that these approximations are reliable, provided that the unpredicted variance in recruitment is not large and the escapement threshold is set below carrying capacity. As an example of how these approximations may be applied, we use demographic and environmental data from a trapped population of martens (Martes americana) in Ontario to evaluate the effect on harvest yield of improvements in prediction of recruitment based on fluctuations in its prey base.

Retrospective analysis and understanding of current practices were aided by interviews with Gazi village elders and by field observations of mangrove tree stumps. GIS-based vegetation maps were combined with data obtained using the point-centred quarter method (PCQM), an accuracy analysis was performed, and forestry parameters were derived from the resultant PCQM data. In addition to general human-induced degradation of vegetation structure and floristic composition of the seaward mangrove zone, a particular sandy beach is expanding at the expense of mangrove, whereas the back mangrove zone has undergone minor changes. Aerial photographs of 1992 and current field data show an apparent zonation of 6 different monospecific or mixed mangrove communities, with a high importance of Rhizophora mucronata in each community and each vegetation layer. Retrospective vegetation structure was combined with correspondence analyses on the PCQM data derived for adult, young and juvenile trees in order to make predictions. Present dynamics initiated by anthropogenic degradation of mangroves continues, even though human impact has diminished.

The program package FORRUS-S consists of the model of natural development of multispecies uneven-aged stand, the model of exogenous influence (including sylvicultural activities) and a set of accessory programs (standard GIS, reference databases, modules recoding input and output information, etc.). The available to date set of reference databases allows forecasting of stand dynamics in the zone of mixed coniferous-broad-leaved forests in European Russia. Since within this zone photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) is the main limiting factor, it is recalculated at each step while other factors as soil richness and humidity are considered constant throughout the modelling cycle. Modelling is performed for each cohort separately, i.e. a group of individuals of same species and ontogenetic state. Each cohort is described by a set of biological parameters stored in specially compiled reference databases (biometrics of tree crown, demand for light, gaps in the canopy, crown transparency to light, seed dispersal distance, sprouting ability, growth tables, potential stand quality index, etc.). Growth increment, thinning and natural regeneration are modelled with the step equal to 5 years. The model utilizes the principle of subdivision of the space into discrete three-dimensional elements. This approach makes it possible to consider the available PAR in the zone of active growth in a tree crown, and also to take into account spatial heterogeneity of growth conditions such as relief and soil characteristics. Modelling area can be up to several thousands of hectares. A number of external modules simulating sylvicultural measures can be enabled or disabled at any modelling step. FORRUS-S allows modelling of various scenarios of sylvicultural activity including: (1) natural stand development, (2) complete cycles of sylvicultural measures according to the current regulations and specifications of Russian Forest Service, (3) with infringement of technology specifications (heavy upper thinning and removing the best trees, clear cutting with destroying natural regeneration without planting). A set of tools was developed for analysis of various output databases and forecasted maps produced by means of GIS-technology. Model utilizes the standard input data have traditionally been using in forestry of the Russian Federation (taxation site descriptions, forest stand maps) and available for virtually all Russian territory.

We provide five instructive examples of the limitations to our ability to forecast the fate of stream and riverine ecosystems one drawn from each modeling step: (a) Accurate economic methods to forecast land-use changes over long periods (such as 20 years) are not available, especially not at spatially explicit scales; (b) geographic data are not always available at the appropriate resolution and are not always organized in categories that are hydrologically, ecologically, or economically meaningful; (c) the relationship between low flows and land use is sometimes hard to establish in anthropogenically affected catchments; (d) bed mobility, suspended sediment load, and channel form-all of which are important for ecological communities in streams-are difficult to predict; and (e) species distributions in rivers are not well documented, and the data that do exist are not always publicly available or have not been sampled at accurate scales, making it difficult to model ecological responses to specified levels of environmental change. Meeting these challenges will require both interdisciplinary cooperation and a reviewed commitment to intradisciplinary research in the fields of economics, geography, quantitative spatial analysis, hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology.",,,,"Nilsson, Christer/AAI-1354-2019; Moglen, Glenn/F-5452-2010; Lucas, Elizabeth A/E-2733-2010","Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121",,,,,79,81,3,65,,,,1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,NOV,2003,6,7,,,,,659,674,,10.1007/s10021-002-0217-2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000186779400004,,,,,

Routine monitoring data are not sufficient for early warning due to the large temporal and spatial variability in the occurrence of surface waterblooms, and the time lag between the formation of the scum and the availability of relevant information for risk management. We combined a ""traditional"" dynamic simulation model based upon differential equations with fuzzy logic to describe the three main conditions governing surface waterbloom formation: (1) a preexisting population of cyanobacteria, (2) buoyancy of the cells, and (3) stability of the water column. The attributes and membership functions of the fuzzy model were based on earlier field studies of diel changes in buoyancy and vertical distribution of cyanobacteria. The model was applied without further calibration to the large lake IJsselmeer (1200 km(2)) in the Netherlands, and we validated the model output using 12 years of NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers) satellite images on which surface blooms are discernible as an enhanced vegetation index or increased surface water temperature. Existing surface blooms were predicted with high accuracy, but additional blooms were also predicted. A statistical test (Cohen's Kappa) showed that correct predictions of the absence or presence of surface blooms were highly unlikely to have occurred by chance only. The model can be used to predict the occurrence of surface waterblooms in advance on the basis of the long-term weather forecast, leaving time for appropriate management of the problem.

The first of them is a simple box model whose analytical solutions permit to establish easily evaluated relations between the short-term and long-term controls of pollutants emissions and the model parameters. The dispersion of a primary and secondary pollutants emitted to the atmosphere by point, line and area sources is also simulated with a more general two-dimensional diffusion-advection-reaction model. The duality principle based on using the adjoint model is derived to formulate sufficient restrictions on the emission rates of different sources allowing to maintain mean concentrations of both pollutants in a zone below maximally admissible values (sanitary norms). A short-term control strategy using the solution to the adjoint model is suggested. The control (correction of emission rates) is implemented any time when the model forecast of at least one mean pollution concentration is unfavorable. The control strategy is optimal in that it minimizes the changes in the original emission rates. The minimization process is subjected to a restriction imposed with the duality principle. The optimal control parameters are obtained with an efficient algorithm of the successive orthogonal projections. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The ability to germinate rapidly at low temperatures has been proposed as one of many mechanisms that confer a competitive advantage to this species. Previous studies of this phenomenon, however, have been limited to relatively simple comparisons of total germinability and germination rate under selected constant-temperature treatments. In this study, we germinated seeds of cheatgrass and two native perennial bunchgrass species, bluebunch wheatgrass [Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Love] and big squirreltail [Elymus multisetus (J.G. Smith) M.E. Jones], over the temperature range of 0-36degreesC and water potential range of 0 to -2.5 MPa. A hydrothermal germination model was constructed to predict germination rate response for the 10, 25 and 50th percentile seed subpopulations. Germination rate estimates were predicted for each species, seedlot and subpopulation for every hour of a 38-year simulation of seedbed temperature and water potential. The seasonal and annual distributions of potential germination rate were integrated to assess relative seedlot response across a wide-range of microclimatic conditions. The integrated response-potential of cheatgrass was consistent with previous studies but the absolute magnitude of enhanced germination rate was relatively small compared to expected differences in seed numbers between cheatgrass and planted species in the field. Historical patterns of seedbed microclimate and predicted germination response may be useful in assessing and optimizing alternative field planting scenarios. Inclusion of weather forecasting and seedbed modeling may provide real-time management options for improving rangeland seeding success.

A stage-structured insect population model for two interacting species forecasts that as interspecific interaction is increased there occurs a sequence of dynamic changes (bifurcations) in which the classic Lotka-Volterra-type scenario with two stable competitive exclusion equilibria is altered abruptly to a novel scenario with three locally stable entities; namely, two competitive exclusion equilibria and a stable coexistence cycle. This scenario is novel in that it predicts the competitive coexistence of two nearly identical species on a single limiting resource and does so under circumstances of increased interspecific competition.

The plans were evaluated for the Blue Riverwatershed in the Cascade Range of Oregon, USA. We used two model types: logistic regression and an ecological neighborhood model using a form of nonparametric regression (SpOcc; Species Occurrence Modeler). Both logistic regression and SpOcc successfully estimated the occurrence of the lichen Lobaria oregana in the current landscape, based on elevation and structural classes of forests. Structural classes were defined by combinations of (1) overstory retention of remnant trees, (2) young cohort age, and (3) stream position (upland vs. riparian). Lobaria oregana rapidly diminished in frequency in the landscape at elevations above 900-1000 in. Young, even-aged stands had little or no Lobaria oregana. Most of the other structural classes, however, were very similar in frequency of Lobaria. The differences in lichens between retention levels and between mature and old growth stands were very small compared to the differences with respect to elevation and clearcutting. Similar results, with varying importances of elevation and forest structure, were, obtained for most of the 20 species with the strongest models. Many of these species were associated with old growth, and many were forecasted to be more frequent under either management plan than in the current landscape. This is a likely response to the reduction of even-aged management in this, landscape. We recommend using SpOcc for flexible nonparametric fitting of,species relationships to a multivariate habitat. SpOcc avoids the need to specify response functions and, because it is multiplicative rather than additive, automatically models responses to interactions among predictors.",,,,,,,,,,25,25,0,9,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

These estimates could provide insights into rates of migration in response to climate change and rates of alien invasions. LDD information is not available for parameterization of current models because it is hard to obtain. We combine a new stochastic model with a flexible framework that permits assimilation of evidence that might be derived from a range of sources. Results are consistent with the prediction of traditional diffusion that population spread has a finite asymptotic velocity. Unlike traditional diffusion, spread is not well described by the mean; it is erratic. In contrast with deterministic models, our results show that inherent uncertainty, rather than parameter sensitivity, thwarts informative forecasts of spread velocity. Analysis shows that, because LDD is inherently unpredictable, even full knowledge of LDD parameters might not provide informative estimates of velocity for populations characterized by LDD. Although predictive distributions are too broad to provide precise estimates of spread rate, they are valuable for comparing spread potential among species and for identifying potential for invasion. Using combinations of dispersal data and the estimates provided by dispersal biologists that derive from multiple sources, the model predicts spread rates that are much slower than those from traditional (deterministic) fat-tailed models and from simulation models of spread, but for different reasons. Deterministic fat-tailed models overestimate spread rate, because they assume that fractions of individuals can rapidly occupy distant sites. Stochastic models recognize that distant colonization is limited to discrete individuals. Stochastic simulations of plant migration overestimate migration of trees, because they typically assume values of R-0 that are too large.",,,,"Lewis, Mark A/C-5015-2008; Clark, James S./G-6331-2011; Lewis, Mark/A-2659-2014","Lewis, Mark A/0000-0002-7155-7426; ",,,,,188,196,2,74,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2003,84,8,,,,,1979,1988,,10.1890/01-0618,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000185073100005,,,,,

Most of the abandonment occurred 30 to 40 years ago and this process has now stopped. Thus, we lack data on the very first phase of tree colonization. We anticipate that a simulation tool could bring an appreciable help in (i) rebuilding the entire colonization process-including the initial phase-of pine settlement and (ii) answering questions about the origin of the narrow and unimodal distributions of age of pine stands we observed. In addition, such a simulator could help managers to forecast extension of Scots pine and to predict growth and evolution of present secondary forests. A spatially explicit individual-based model is presented. The model takes into account both space and time and includes growth of trees, seed production and seed dispersal, death and competition between individuals. The influence of the initial parameters are analyzed and elements of validation given. The model was then used to predict tree settlement and stand establishment using the initial conditions from a natural stand studied in the field whose characteristics before abandonment were known (number and age-distribution of trees, location of mother trees, time of abandonment). Three simulations were achieved by using the same initial conditions but following different scenarios for the recruitment process. The scenario of a fluctuating resistance of the resident vegetation (that controls the susceptibility of the environment to tree establishment) seemed as one of the most probable to explain the actual stand characteristics. We thus concluded that dynamic models could be improved by taking into account the resistance of the vegetation to colonization as a fluctuating parameter instead of a static and permanent attribute.",,,,"Coquillard, Patrick/D-6550-2012",,,,,,29,29,0,14,,,,1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2003,168,1,,,,,121,137,,10.1023/A:1024404214782,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,,,WOS:000183835900011,,,,,

Predictions were made both at the scale of the Fynbos Biome (the dominant vegetation assemblage in the CFR) and for selected Proteaceae species. Bioclimatic modelling identified parts of the biome at particular risk from climate change. Species-level modelling (Generalised Additive Modelling) was done for 28 Proteaceae species selected from areas at high risk of biome loss, revealing individualistic range changes in a pattern broadly consistent with biome modelling results. Most species experienced potential range contractions (17 of 28), of which five showed range elimination. Several species (I I of 28) showed potential range expansions. For species showing range contractions, current land transformation had less impact on future potential ranges than did climate change, because many species ranges shifted to higher altitudes where land transformation is currently less prevalent. Fewer than half of the high-risk species showed overlap between current and future potential range, showing that propagule transport, establishment of species in novel ranges and conservation of landscape linkages will be critical for maintenance of biodiversity.

Location Data are from 10,653 georeferenced sites in Washington State, USA, along a longitudinal gradient from west of the crest of the Cascade Range to the beginnings of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and across two physiographic provinces, the Northern Cascades, characterized by steep, rugged topography, and the Okanogan Highlands, presenting moderate slopes and broad rounded summits. Methods Tree data were drawn from the USDA Forest Service Area Ecology Program database, collected in mature, undisturbed stands. We compared simple climatic variables (annual temperature, growing-degree days, annual and seasonal precipitation) to biophysical variables (soil, hydrologic, and solar radiation) derived from climatic variables. Climatic and biophysical variables were taken from the output of climatological and hydrological simulation models and estimated for each plot in the tree database. Generalized linear models were used, for each of fourteen tree species, at multiple spatial extents, to estimate the probability of occurrence of that species as a function of climatic and biophysical predictors. Models were validated by a combination of bootstrapping and estimating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results For the majority of species, we were able to fit variables representing both moisture and temperature gradients, and in all but a few cases these models identified a unimodal response of species occurrence to these gradients. In some cases the ecological/environmental niche of a species had been clearly captured by the model, whereas in others a longer gradient in the predictor variable(s) would be needed. Responses of most species were consistent across three spatial scales.

We determined that a first-order feedback structure and non-linear effects of Antarctic Oscillation Index (AAOI) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) explain 96% of the variation in annual per capita population growth rates. One important result of this study is that first-order feedback structure captures the essential features of population dynamics of long-tailed rice rats. This regulatory structure suggests that rice rats are limited by food, space or predators and regulated by intra-specific competition. The first-order dynamics observed in long-tailed rice rats strongly suggests that Hantavirus have no harmful effects on survival or reproductive processes. Besides the non-linear climatic signature in population dynamics, the periodic event of bamboo-flowering and mast seeding strongly influence rice rats population growth rates. Because of this, bamboo flowering may be used as a signal for forecasting long-tail rice rats outbreaks and for implementing information and health policies to avoid human-rodent contacts in specific areas.

We used gap capture methods and a simulation approach to forecast canopy composition in three old oak forests (Quercus spp.) on dry-mesic sites in southern Wisconsin, USA. In the simulation, a gap sapling is considered successful if it exceeds a threshold height of 13-17 m (height of maximum crown width of canopy trees) before its crown center can be overtopped by lateral crown growth of mature trees. The composition of both the tallest gap trees and simulated gap captures suggests that 68-90% of the next generation of canopy trees in the stands will consist of non-Quercus species, particularly Ulmus rubra, Carya ovata and Prunus serotina. Quercus species will probably remain as a lesser stand component, with Quercus alba and Quercus rubra predicted to comprise about 19% of successful gap trees across the three stands. Several methods of predicting future canopy composition gave similar results, probably because no gap opportunist species were present in these stands and there was an even distribution of species among height strata in gaps. Gap trees of competing species already average 11-13 m tall, and mean expected time for these trees to reach full canopy height is only 19 years. For these reasons, we suggest that dominance will shift from oaks to other species, even though late successional species (e. g., Acer and Tilia) are not presently common in the understories of these stands.",,,,,,,,,,17,17,1,16,,,,1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUL,2003,167,1,,,,,71,88,,10.1023/A:1023975026261,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,,,WOS:000183204200007,,,,,

The scientific objective of the study was to assess whether or not two types of timber harvesting at various rotation lengths would have biogeochemical and biomass implications that are within the natural range of variation caused by wildfire. The practical objective was to identify management strategies that would sustain or improve long-term site productivity in lodgepole pine forests in the central interior of British Columbia. We defined three fire severity categories (low, medium and high), three fire return intervals (40, 80 and 120 years), two utilization levels (including stem-only harvesting [SOH] and whole-tree harvesting [WTH]), and three timber production rotation lengths (40, 80 and 120 years). Differences in simulated productivity, decomposing litter mass, total available soil nitrogen and nitrogen removals were compared for all 15 combinations of the five levels of disturbance at the three frequencies. The simulated nutritional impacts of timber harvesting were within the simulated range of impacts caused by the wildfire defined in this study. They were similar to the simulated long-interval, low-severity wildfire regimes. Simulations suggest that ecological rotation lengths for long-term site productivity for lodgepole pine forests in the study area would be 80-120 years. These rotation lengths are close to the average wildfire return intervals (100-125 years) in the study area, supporting the idea that the present harvesting strategies should sustain tree growth at this frequency of harvest and severity of harvesting impacts. Both WTH and SOH are acceptable harvesting methods for the maintenance of long-term site productivity in these lodgepole pine forests if harvest intervals are 80 years or longer. However, SOH is a more nutrient conservative harvest method, and should be used instead of WTH for rotations less than 80 years. The importance of initial site quality in assessing sustainable long-term site productivity by modeling is demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The notion that ratadas are associated with bamboo flowering and subsequent mast seeding at cycles of 30 years has appeared in the literature since the late 1800s. Based on 63 well-documented cases, we show that not only are ratadas associated with bamboo blooming, but also many are associated with rainfall peaks, and that these two outbreak types are geographically interspersed over South America. In addition, we dispel the notion that South American bamboo blooms occur every 30 years, which may only be the case for Merostachys fistulosa . For other species the modal cycles occur every 14 (Merostachys spp.), 12 (Chusquea quila and/or valdiviensis) or 14 years (Chusquea coleou). We also propose the hypothesis that rainfall-associated ratadas are ultimately caused by the occurrence of El Nino, and discuss the possible population dynamic mechanisms underlying rodent outbreaks in South America. Aiming at setting a standardized framework for spatial and temporal comparisons, we propose a trapping protocol and a threshold density for assigning the 'ratada' label. Several of the mice implicated in ratadas are reservoirs of emerging diseases, thus emphasizing the need for predictive power to forecast disease epidemics that affect human populations. Further, ratadas may be viewed as pulsed resources, thus enabling us to learn more of the ways communities respond to such intermittent inputs.",,,,"Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013; jaksic, Fabian m/G-1705-2014","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; jaksic, fabian/0000-0003-0098-0291",,,,,103,112,0,32,,,,1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,JUN,2003,28,3,,,,,237,251,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2003.01271.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000183797900002,,,,,

A simulated process of species extinction by a stepwise density dependent random elimination of species affected species-area patterns differently. For Mediterranean countries SAR slopes decreased, for other European countries slopes increased during the extinction process. Comparisons of species numbers before and after extinction with those predicted by a classical SAR approach differed widely and revealed that SARs are not able to predict future species numbers at local scales. For Mediterranean countries the classical SAR approach underestimated the number of species remaining after simulated extinction, for all other European countries SARs highly overestimated species numbers. These contrasting patterns indicate that changes in SAR patterns do not unequivocally point to changes in species diversity or community structure as assumed by current theory. On the other hand, the results strongly indicate that simplified applications of SARs for forecasting might give misimpressions about species loss and future biodiversity if the initial community structure, especially relative densities and numbers of species with restricted range size, are not taken into account.",,,,"Ulrich, Werner/A-6582-2013","Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619",,,,,40,40,0,8,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JUN,2003,26,3,,,,,365,373,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2003.03441.x,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000183344700011,,,,,

Typically, model predictions are extremely sensitive to estimated parameters, resulting in risk estimates that are very imprecise. Therefore, careful consideration of uncertainty is warranted when reporting PVA predictions. Here, we survey some simple and general simulation-based methods for assessing the uncertainty in model-based forecasts. We then illustrate how these methods can be used for incorporating parameter uncertainty when reporting estimates of extinction risk, using a PVA model developed from data on Pacific Chinook salmon stocks. Several researchers have suggested that relative assessments between management options will be more stable than estimates of extinction risk and population growth rate. We illustrate how the uncertainty in relative assessments can be quantified in a rigorous way. Finally, we show how Sobol' indices can be used to ask: ""Where is the uncertainty coming from?"" These indices are an ANOVA-like decomposition of the effects of parameters on model output that take into account both direct effects (as in standard sensitivity analysis) and effects due to interactions with other parameters. Throughout, we illustrate these methods using models relevant to the life cycle of Pacific salmon, with the intent of assessing the relative influences of habitat, harvest, and hatcheries on the viability of salmon populations.

Moreover, extensive simulation shows that only the last peak is needed if the forecast concerns the population at the top of the food chain and that peaks variability often increases from bottom to top.

This letter reports how, contrary to intuition, introducing such a component of variability may improve the precision of extinction forecasts. The paradoxical result arises because the dependence of extinction probability on growth rate is weakened, and shifted onto other parameters (e.g. diffusion strength) where dependence is less sensitive.

The capacity of plants to migrate to sites of suitable environmental quality will strongly influence future distributions of plant diversity. However, it is not well understood how rates of plant migration are influenced by the habitat loss and habitat fragmentation that characterise contemporary landscapes. In this study we develop a model that can predict migration rates in both intact landscapes (potential migration rate) and in fragmented landscapes (realised migration rates). Migration rates in fragmented landscapes might be slower for many reasons. In this study we focus on two, non-exclusive reasons. First, the processes that move seeds may break down in fragmented landscapes causing seeds to be dispersed shorter distances. Second, in fragmented landscapes some proportion of seeds will not be deposited in habitats suitable for recruitment. We describe the breakdown of dispersal processes as a competing risk between the factors influencing dispersal in intact landscapes and the factors that may disrupt dispersal processes in fragmented landscapes. We show how the parameters that influence dispersal in fragmented landscapes can be estimated, and how these estimates can be used to forecast migration rates using an integrodifference, equation (IDE). The forecasts of the IDE described the effects of reduced dispersal distances adequately. However, the IDE produced biased estimates of the effects of a reduction in plant habitat on migration rates. Model analyses showed that, although we can expect realised migration rates to be lower than potential migration rates, we can also expect the sensitivity of migration rate to habitat loss to vary. In addition, simulations showed that the qualitative nature of the responses of migration rate to habitat loss were variable - some model species responded non-linearly to habitat loss, others responded linearly.

Nevertheless, they were poor in presenting detailed methodologies on how to assess and create urban sustainability. This study aims at developing a model to assess urban sustainability. Given the vastness of data to be built as well as the time and financial constraints at hand, assessment indicators were chosen with a focus on elements affecting climate change and air pollution at an urban level. The developed model was applied to 57 case study cities out of 80 cities in South Korea in order to verify the applicability and feasibility of the model. Urban sustainability assessment model (USAM) is composed of three basic models: driving force, pressure, state, effect, response (DPSER) model, stage model, and the space size model. Unlike the past assessment system that was unclear in what and how to assess for assessing sustainability, the USAM presented in this study allows an organized and systematic analysis through the DPSER model. Furthermore, the stage model made it easy to formulate measures to create a sustainable city by understanding the development history and changes of a city as well as forecasting possible impacts. In addition, the space size model compares cities with different space sizes and also sets a relation between a nation and a city. It also offers a framework to define relations and to compare across nations or a nation with a city instead of simply viewing a city as a single unit. The USAM does not present the degree of urban sustainability as a final output. Instead, it generates and applies a series of processes and methods of assessment in an urban sustainability perspective. In the process, the development pattern of a city and its negative impact on environment will be understood and appropriate and effective countermeasures will be confirmed. Such a process establishes urban sustainability and may be used as a means for us to understand what specific actions we need to take in order to promote urban sustainability.

This paper presents the landscape-scale results from these monitoring programs and outlines a method for exploring the relationships between two such data sets. Seagrass species occurrence and abundance data were used to define eight benthic habitat classes from 677 sampling locations in Florida Bay. Water quality data from 28 monitoring stations spread across the Bay were used to construct a discriminant function model that assigned a probability of a given benthic habitat class occurring for a given combination of water quality variables. Mean salinity, salinity variability, the amount of light reaching the benthos, sediment depth, and mean nutrient concentrations were important predictor variables in the discriminant function model. Using a cross-validated classification scheme, this discriminant function identified the most likely benthic habitat type as the actual habitat type in most cases. The model predicted that the distribution of benthic habitat types in Florida Bay would likely change if water quality and water delivery were changed by human engineering of freshwater discharge from the Everglades. Specifically, an increase in the seasonal delivery of freshwater to Florida Bay should cause an expansion of seagrass beds dominated by Ruppia maritima and Halodule wrightii at the expense of the Thalassia testudinum-dominated community that now occurs in northeast Florida Bay. These statistical techniques should prove useful for predicting landscape-scale changes in community composition in diverse systems where communities are in quasi-equilibrium with environmental drivers.",,,,"Fourqurean, James/B-4606-2008","Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500",,,,,79,84,4,50,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Monteith's model is used for the calculation of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), the Carnegie Institution Stanford model is used for determining the light use efficiency, and the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is used to describe the spatio-temporal variability in land wetness conditions. The new model requires a crop identification map and some standard meteorological measurements as inputs. The conversion of above ground dry biomass into crop yield has been calibrated through harvest indices and the values obtained are compared with the international literature. The computations were executed in a GIS environment using 20 satellite measurements of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) to cover an annual crop rotation cycle. The validation with district data revealed a root mean square error of 525, 616, 551 and 13,484 kg ha(-1) for wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane yield, respectively. The model performs satisfactorily for wheat, rice and sugarcane, and poorly for cotton. It is expected that the accuracy of the model applied to 1.1 km pixels decreases with the increasing number of crops occurring within a given pixel. Although AVHRR is basically too coarse a resolution for field scale crop yield estimations, the results provides yield predictions to policy makers in Pakistan with a spatial detail that is better than the traditional district level data. The gaps between the average and the maximum yield are 1075 and 1246 kg ha(-1) for wheat and rice, respectively. Future work should rely on the integration of high and low resolution images to estimate field scale crop yields. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The commonly used back-propagation learning algorithm is employed for training the ANN. The modeling is based on (a) comprehensive biweekly water quality data at Tolo Harbour (1982-2000); and (b) 4-year set of weekly phytoplankton abundance data at Lamina Island (1996-2000). Algal biomass is represented as chlorophyll-a and cell concentration of Skeletonema at the two locations, respectively. Analysis of a large number of scenarios shows that the best agreement with observations is obtained by using merely the time-lagged algal dynamics as the network input. In contrast to previous findings with more complicated neural networks of algal blooms in freshwater systems, the present work suggests the algal concentration in the eutrophic sub-tropical coastal water is mainly dependent on the antecedent algal concentrations in the previous 1-2 weeks. This finding is also supported by an interpretation of the neural networks' weights. Through a systematic analysis of network performance, it is shown that previous reports of predictability of algal dynamics by ANN are erroneous in that 'future data' have been used to drive the network prediction. In addition, a novel real time forecast of coastal algal blooms based on weekly data at Lamina is presented. Our study shows that an ANN model with a small number of input variables is able to capture trends of algal dynamics, but data with a minimum sampling interval of 1 week is necessary. However, the sufficiency of the weekly sampling for real time predictions using ANN models needs to be further evaluated against longer weekly data sets as they become available.

Governments of many countries are deeply interested in the processes that drive the temperature increase and the rate of increase, for the purpose of being able to predict future conditions. Large investments. are being made in development and application of mathematical models that can be used to predict future temperature increase and to evaluate measures that can arrest the increase. The models account for the interacting exchange processes between the atmosphere, land, oceans and icefields. Uncertainty in the forecasts arises from uncertainty about the processes represented by the models (Weaver and Zwiers, 2000). The carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is considered to be an important contributor to the temperature increase because of its ability to trap long wave radiation coming from the Earth's surface. Thus global warming is associated with the increase in CO2 concentration observed during the past century. In this paper we call attention to the importance of biogeochemical processes of soil ecosystems and to the need to incorporate details of the physical and chemical steps in the mathematical forecasting models. The chemical weathering of carbonate-silicate rocks is one of the principal pathways by which CO2 can be taken from the air over long-term, multimillion year timescales. The weathering steps and therefore the rate of carbon removal from the atmosphere depend very much on the rate of plant growth. We introduce three examples of geochemical processes in the space available to us. Geochemical processes influence the global carbon cycle, and thus, climate change. Here we examine the contributions of the geochemical processes which occur in soil ecosystems. It has been observed that the terrestrial ecosystems of the mid-latitude in the Northern Hemisphere take up and store significant amounts of carbon each year. The phenomenon was first reported by Tans et al. (1990) and later confirmed by Ciasis et al. (1995). This observation suggests that the relation between recently observed global warming trends and the increasing cor centration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is more complicated than implied by the emphasis on contributions from burning fossil fuels. Evaluation of the distribution of the landmasses on the globe shows that a large fraction of the total land mass is at the mid-latitude of the Northern Hemisphere., Thus, it is logical to look for the hypothesized soil ecosystem sink in the Northern Hemisphere. Identification of the mechanisms that could drive such a sink is important. We suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the sink could be leaching of dissolved inorganic carbon from soils to groundwater which could in turn carry the carbon to rivers and finally to the, oceans where precipitation occurs, and/or processes which extract the carbon from the air as a result of dissolution of carbonate and silicate rocks. Products from this dissolution are also carried to the oceans where carbonates are precipitated. We show examples of current biogeochemical processes in soil ecosystems and note that these processes continue to make a powerful contribution to the global carbon cycle.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,10,,,,,,90-5809-571-1,,,,2003,,,,,,,253,261,,,,,,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",,,WOS:000184355600026,,,,,

In this context, integrated studies are being conducted to understand the response of dust emission and deposition to climatic and land-use change in the and southwestern United States. Several approaches are taken to monitor wind erosion and characterize modem dust - its sources, flux, and composition - to document the potential for desertification under future climatic conditions. Wind erosion is monitored at ecologically sensitive sites, using meteorological stations that measure sand flux within the saltation layer. Dust deposition is also monitored at these and many other sites using different types of dust collectors. In addition, new remote sensing methods detect the location, frequency, magnitude, and duration of large dust-emission events. Remotely sensed images of vegetation change, combined with those that illustrate high soil reflectivity, complement dust-detection methods to identify areas especially susceptible to wind erosion. Dust trapped in collectors and in snow is characterized for its physical, mineralogic, and chemical properties. Combined with soil and weather data, such characterization sheds light on: (1) the relation between dust storms and synoptic climatic conditions; (2) the importance of Owens (dry) Lake (California) as a dominant source of southwestern U.S. dust, for as much as 400 km downwind; (3) the impacts of human disturbances in the desert, revealed by signatures of agricultural and construction dust; and (4) the composition and flux of regional background dust composition and flux. Past dust flux is studied from late Quaternary eolian deposits, partly using a new combination of magnetic and chemical methods developed to recognize eolian dust in soils and surficial deposits over large regions. Such studies have applications to understanding current plant distribution, substrates for biologic soil crust, and paleoenvironmental histories of ecosystems. A wind-erosion model based on wind strength, atmospheric shear stress on the surface, and atmospheric stability is being developed. This model will be constrained by remote sensing and ground-based observations and will then be linked with a regional climate model and interactive vegetation package to forecast how various climatic and land-use scenarios interact with critical wind speeds required to move surface materials. We will attempt to answer the following questions: How does wind strength vary with natural climate cycles on decadal and century time scales? To what extent will winds become stronger or weaker under future climate scenarios? How have soil moisture and vegetation changes affected wind erosion in the past, and what can we expect in the future? As an example of possible future conditions, projections of doubled atmospheric CO2 (above pre-industrial levels) for the southwestern U.S. suggest a decrease in winter soil moisture, which may enhance wind erosion.",,,,,,,,,,11,11,0,10,,,,,,90-5809-571-1,,,,2003,,,,,,,271,282,,,,,,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",,,WOS:000184355600028,,,,,

This was experienced even during the recent geological period, i.e. the Holocene. Radiocarbon tests show that even below the sands of the Empty Quarter, there are existing signs of recent periods of greenery (McClure, 1976; UNEP, 1977, p. 109). The Arabic language has a wealth of synonyms for the word ""lion"" and other Savannah animals proving that favourable climates existed even after the present-day version of the Arabic language has been in practice in Arabia. Such facts and findings consolidate the idea that the basic topography of the Peninsula does not present an inhibitive permanent barrier to favourable climates, (Elagib et al., 1990). Ironically to-day deserts and dry lands cover over 90% of the peninsula, even though its climate is dominated by two normally powerful moisture bearing wind systems which are renowned for their effectiveness if they find welcoming ecosystems. These are the Mediterranean type moist winds that frequent the northern and eastern parts of the peninsula during winter, and the monsoons that cause rainfall over the southwestern parts during summer. Experiences drawn from the recent episodes of drought in Africa and scientific observations show that such adverse conditions of drought and desertification happen in the mainland when the canopy of rain forests in the path of the rain currents entering the main land are stripped or degraded. The forests canopy, if existing, would hold most of the rainwater in the foliage thus helping it to re-evaporate, and advance as clouds to the main land (Hare and Lettau in UNEP, 1977; Elagib, 1986). In addition to this phenomenon, forests are known to provide favourable ecosystems and microclimates, which attract more precipitation and stabilise the frequency of rainfall. The advantage availed by the canopy phenomenon is that rehabilitation can start at the canopy end where rain is still available and not inland where water is scarce. Global (or general) Climate Circulation Models, usually denoted by GCM's. are well known since the 1960's. However, it is only recently that the dynamics of the plant and vegetation cover (the Biosphere in general) have been included in interactive modelling (McGuffie and Henderson-Sellers, 1977; Sud et al., 1993 and Eltahir, 1996). The objective of this experiment is to develop several scenarios simulating the past (or possible) natural greenery in the Peninsula and what could have been (or should be) the prevailing ambient environmental conditions and ecosystems in, and around, the Peninsula (namely both the climatological and the ecological conditions). It is suggested that these scenarios be developed through the above-cited experiences with interactive models. These models were very useful in evaluation of the negative effects of deforestation on climate change, global warming and drought. The challenge here is to use them to make innovative possible plans for afforestation in the form of favourable grids of forest canopies and ecosystems which may help to attract more precipitation and deploy inland richer rain currents, and hence initiate the process of natural re-greening, because rains provide the-natural elements of regeneration and reversal of desertification. It is noted that most of the present projects dealing with desertification are no more than projects aiming at a happier mode of coexistence with the deserts. The significance of this experiment is that it provides the chance to utilise the overwhelming scientific innovations and technologies that Man has wielded to design long term plans to combat and to reverse desertification. The techniques of modelling can now avail the opportunities to assess the viability of these long term plans and projects at desktop and at little cost, where otherwise there is no degree of certainty about their long term out-come. The immense information from remote sensing imagery, satellite archives and GIS provide the tools for parameterisation of the models and forecast of projections.",,,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,,,,,,90-5809-571-1,,,,2003,,,,,,,399,405,,10.1201/NOE9058095718.ch43,,,,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",,,WOS:000184355600043,,,,,

Thus,storm surge and estuary flooding can be accurately determined well in advance of a storm. CEMEPS output is routinely used by the North Carolina Office of the National Weather Service to make forecasts of coastal and estuary flooding during the passage of Tropical and Extra-Tropical Cyclones. While the model system is currently focused on the coasts of the Carolinas, CEMEPS could be ported to all coasts. The goal of CEMEPS is to improve the capacity of coastal communities to reduce flood impacts.",,,,,,,,,,3,3,0,1,,,,1369-8273,,1-85312-834-1,ADV ECOL SCI,Adv. Ecol.

This study details a novel strategy that enabled us to rapidly collect data on macrofaunal densities and sediment characteristics by sampling mud-to-sand transition zones in 19 estuaries. Species-specific models that predict probability of occurrence relative to sediment mud content were developed for 13 common macrofaunal species. However, the roles played by many macrofaunal species are influenced by density, not just occurrence. Over broad spatial scales, the constraint an environmental variable places on density can be represented by the upper (or lower) limit on density. Thus, the distribution of maximum density along the gradient from mud to sand was modelled as another indicator of a species' preference. Both the maximum and minimum values for number of taxa, number of individuals, Shannon-Wiener diversity and taxonomic distinctness were also modelled. For most variables, good models (r(2) > 0.6) were developed. The models developed for the different species exhibited a wide variety of functional forms, highlighting the potential variation in response to habitat change even for closely related species with similar natural history characteristics.

This vision, however, misses a large class of models that are ""simple"" in the sense that they consist of only one or a few equations. Three uses of simple models in ecosystem research are comparisons of empirical relationships, evaluation of alternate states, and prediction. Comparisons of ecosystems often reveal empirical patterns. For example, general patterns of the sinking flux of organic matter as a function of primary production differ between lakes and ocean systems. An evaluation of the underlying relationships reveals a distinction between oligotrophic systems that suggests fundamental differences between take and ocean primary producers. Simple dynamic models represent a second type of modeling approach that is particularly useful for exploring conditions that promote shifts in ecosystem states. An example of these alternate states is the shift from turbid to clear-water conditions in shallow lakes. Simple models also provide predictions and may outperform more complex models in forecasting. A recent evaluation of models that forecast the dynamics of the 1997-1998 El Ni (n) over tildeo reveals that well-developed dynamic and statistical models were no better, and in some cases much worse, than a simple empirical model based on historical data. Simple models have a wide utility in ecosystem science. They are useful for exploring general questions and depicting ideas as well as for evaluating specific research problems.

The predictive capacity of science holds great appeal for decision makers who are grappling with complex and controversial environmental issues by promising to enhance their ability to determine a need for and outcomes of alternative decisions. As a result, the very process of science can be portrayed as a positive step toward solving a policy problem. The convergence-and perhaps confusion-of prediction in science and prediction for policy presents a suite of hidden dangers for the conduct of science and the challenge of effective decision making. This chapter, organized as a set of inter-related analytical vignettes, seeks to expose some of these hidden dangers and to recommend strategies to overcome them in the process of environmental decision making. In particular, this chapter will try to distill some of the lessons gleaned from research on modeling, prediction, and decision making in the earth and atmospheric sciences for quantitative modeling of ecosystems. One clear implication is that conventional approaches to modeling and prediction cannot simultaneously meet the needs of both science and decision making.

From a practical perspective, Bayes Theorem has a logical appeal in that it characterizes a process of knowledge updating that is based on pooling precision-weighted information. For years however, Bayesian inference was largely ignored or even discredited in favor of frequentist inference; among the reasons were computational difficulties and the formal use of subjective probabilities in applications of Bayes Theorem. In recent years, new computational approaches (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo) have greatly reduced the first problem, while the general recognition of the role of expert judgment in science has at least lessened resistance with respect to the second problem. Beyond that, Bayesian approaches facilitate certain analyses and interpretations that are often important to scientists. For example, the growing recognition of the value of combining information or ""borrowing strength"" in ecological studies, as new information is acquired to augment existing knowledge, is one of several reasons why interest in Bayesian inference continues to increase. Many currently used analytic techniques, such as random coefficients regression, multilevel models, data assimilation, and the Kalman filter are focused on this theme; all of these techniques reflect the basic framework of Bayes Theorem for pooling information. Most ecologists initially are taught that probabilities represent long-run frequencies: A consequence of this perspective is that probabilities have no meaning in a single unique or nonreplicated analysis. Scientists often ignore this constraint and interpret probabilities to suit the particular analysis. Related confusion sometimes arises in classical hypothesis testing and in the interpretation of p values. Bayesian inference provides appealing options in these situations. Collectively, these developments and perspectives have resulted in an increase in the application of Bayesian approaches in ecological studies, a number of which are noted here. Specific examples dealing with combining information, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian networks are discussed in more detail. In sum, it seems reasonable to make the judgmental forecast that Bayesian approaches will continue to increase in use in ecology.",,,,,,,,,,9,9,1,9,,,,,,0-691-09288-5,,,,2003,,,,,,,168,183,,,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000221847700009,,,,,

To date, these approaches have included steady-state mass-balance models, which attempt to quantify the long term sinks for N in an ecosystem below which no deleterious effects are observed, and dose-response models based on empirical data. While there are limitations and uncertainties associated with these approaches, the synthesis of current understanding and effective simplification of knowledge has provided the underpinning science for the N component of the 1999 Gothenberg Protocol. For the future, a need to develop dynamic models to enable the forecasting of the magnitude and direction of change has been identified. Dynamic models have not been used extensively in the past for N critical loading due to a lack of suitable models for the majority of ecosystems and because of the limited availability of regional data at the level of complexity required to parameterize dynamic models.

""Predictions"" of the future fate and state of ecosystems are demanded, raising a number of new challenges for ecological modeling. In this chapter, definitions for the terms ""prediction,"" ""forecast,"" and ""projection"" are proposed, so as to reduce confusion within the scientific community and to avoid misunderstandings when scientists communicate with land managers and policy makers: ""prediction"" implies certainty, ""forecast"" implies likelihood, and ""projection"" implies possibility. Based on these definitions, our capability to predict the future climate is reviewed, because this is a precondition for predicting the ecosystem effects of such changes. It is concluded that we cannot predict the future climate due to a number of uncertainties. Next, the state of research with respect to assessing the impacts of climate change on agriculture, on forest growth and biogeochemistry at the stand scale, and on forest succession is reviewed. In agriculture, predictability of the biophysical impacts of climate change is fairly high, but future agriculture is determined largely by processes other than biophysics, including management practices (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer use), new breeding technologies, and economic globalization. These processes strongly reduce predictability of future agriculture. In forests, predictability is hindered by the temporal mismatch between the scales of observational/experimental data versus that of the target variables. Acclimation and adaptation phenomena, carbon allocation, and belowground dynamics are poorly understood yet remain central to projections of future forest growth and carbon fluxes. In forest succession, there are significant problems with respect to species-specific parameter estimation and with the temporal and spatial scales involved in evaluating the behavior of these models. In addition, forest succession, by definition, includes tree population dynamics (recruitment and mortality), which are highly stochastic, difficult to study, and not well understood. In conclusion, we cannot predict the ecosystem effects of climate change. Scientific research at the present time is dealing with projections of future ecosystem development. Assuming that we can fully specify the uncertainties involved in our analyses, we may be able to provide ecological forecasts, but this is a longer-term research goal.",,,,,,,,,,9,9,1,4,,,,,,0-691-09288-5,,,,2003,,,,,,,385,409,,,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000221847700021,,,,,

This paper presents an extension to the probabilistic forecasting approach first presented in Sharma (2000b), that attempts to enhance the reliability of the model using an ensemble averaging approach. Each ensemble member or model is formulated using nonparametric statistical techniques and is restricted to have a relatively independent basis so as to represent the multiple mechanisms that influence the system being studied. The aim of using ensemble or model averaging is to reduce the chance of model misspecification, a common occurrence when the dependence is highly random and the system too complex to be explained by a limited number of predictors. The usefulness of the procedure is demonstrated through an application to forecast the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the multiple models being formulated using predictors selected from prior lags of the SOI and globally distributed, gridded sea surface temperature anomaly data. The model is assessed by evaluating its performance both in cross-validation as well as by forecasting an entire period of the record that was left out in the model formulation process. The results indicate that the consideration of uncertainty in climatological observations and the use of an ensemble of model outputs results in probabilistic forecasts that are more reliable and accurate than is the case otherwise.

Thus there is a need for skilful seasonal forecasting tools with useful lead-times. Forecast tools based on the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) such as the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are currently used to forecast seasonal rain in Australia, and have similar value for predicting streamflow. This paper evaluates the skill of persistence as a tool for forecasting streamflow on large and small catchments in Australia, and makes some comparisons with the skill of SOI-based forecasts. Monthly streamflow records for 320 unimpacted Australian gauging stations were assessed using an advanced prototype of the Australian Rainman Streamflow version 4.3 software package. This data set had 302 stations with historical time series data from state water agencies and 18 stations with extended/modelled data for small catchments. The following factors were systematically examined in each region of Australia: (1) duration of the predictor period, (2) lead-time, and (3) duration of the period to be forecast. The statistical significance of persistence as a forecasting tool was assessed via serial correlation, Kruskal-Wallis tests and cross-validated LEPS skill scores. Results were evaluated spatially to compare regional responses across Australia. This study showed that persistence is a useful predictor of streamflow in all seasons over much of Australia, with lead-times that are longer than that of ENSO-based forecasting tools. The lag relationship between prior and predicted streamflow was strongest with a lead-time of zero.

Such forecasts need to account for the natural dynamic behaviour of the aquifer, likely recharge scenarios, and recent but unknown abstractions. These requirements mean that forecasts, at say monthly intervals, need to be updated with current observations on a real-time basis. One established procedure for this kind of problem is to fit autoregressive, moving-average, exogenous-variable (ARMAX) time-series models to the history of groundwater levels in response to estimates of land surface recharge. The ARMAX difference equations are then converted into forecast equations that allow real-time updating to include recent forecast errors as an additional source of information. Some disadvantages of this pure time-series analysis approach are the apparent lack of physical concepts in the model formulation and statistical aspects of model identification and calibration that are related to the inherent structure of ARMAX equations. This paper addresses these issues by describing a method for formulating ARMAX forecast equations from a linear system description based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (eigenstructure) of the dynamic behaviour of an aquifer. For the piezometric response of a heterogeneous aquifer to a fixed spatial distribution of land surface recharge, with time-varying magnitude, only a few eigenvalues are significant for describing the dynamics. The resulting model has a simple robust parameter structure, and is easily calibrated and implemented in spreadsheet form. The eigenstructure approach enables transfer of some parameter information from locations with good data records to those with sparse data. This modelling approach is demonstrated with monthly values of land surface recharge, estimated from a daily water balance model, and groundwater level data from an observation well in a 2000 km(2) alluvial aquifer in Canterbury, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1-74052-098-X,,,,2003,,,,,,,248,253,,,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources",,,WOS:000189470800042,,,,,

However, the decision making environment for graziers is often challenging and risky within the naturally high rainfall and pasture growth variability experienced. Many graziers adjust their stock numbers based on the amount of standing feed and expected rainfall. Pasture models are useful if they explain the majority of variability in measured pasture growth, because long time series of measured growth are usually unavailable. The WinGrasp pasture model has been used to successfully simulate pasture growth in other plant communities (e.g. spear grass), however it is yet to be validated using independent data on Mitchell grasslands. If the model is useful in simulating Mitchell grasslands, forecasts of pasture growth can be used to help make better management decisions. Pasture growth forecasts based on El nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have the potential to be more useful than rainfall forecasts for graziers in western Queensland. The accuracy of WinGrasp to simulate and forecast the growth of Mitchell grass needs testing. In this paper we compare the output from WinGrasp to measured total standing dry matter (TSDM) data from long-term grazing trials at Toorak Research Station, Julia Creek in the northern Mitchell grasslands and Rosebank Research Station, Longreach in the central Mitchell grasslands of Queensland. Using observed data from independent sites, the model explained 64 to 81% of the variability of observed TSDM at the industry utilisation levels of 10-50% in the northern Mitchell grasslands and 74 to 84% in the central Mitchell grasslands. In the central Mitchell grasslands predicted TSDM was consistently lower than observed. This was most likely because of changes in botanical composition. We also compared the accuracy of using either measured or interpolated rainfall data in the model to predict TSDM. There was no significant difference between measured and interpolated rainfall data to predict TSDM. Therefore at these locations interpolated rainfall can be used with confidence when modelling pasture growth, however in more remote areas where there are fewer official recording stations interpolated rainfall should be used with more caution. The model was useful for predicting TSDM in the Mitchell grasslands, however further calibration is required to better simulate changes in pasture composition.",,,,,,,,,,4,4,0,2,,,,,,1-74052-098-X,,,,2003,,,,,,,519,524,,,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources",,,WOS:000189470800087,,,,,

Changes induced since European settlement in Australia are of particular interest because impacts can be almost impossible to reverse. A measure of catchment degradation may be determined using accumulation in lakes. Along the east coast of New South Wales, both the rate of sediment infill and the stage of infill reached differ between coastal lagoons as a function of physical characteristics within their catchments, including the erosive power of rainfall, the intrinsic susceptibility of the soils to erosion, as well as the combined effect of slope angle and length. The amount of human development also plays a role in that the nature and extent to which the natural vegetation is disturbed, and practices that control erosion, may influence sediment loss. Sediment accumulation rate in a lake has its own value, but when placed in the context of natural resource planning, it is retrospective and may not be the most efficient approach to land management in catchments. Thus, there is a need to forecast degradation; however, most research has tended to focus on ""universal"" applications that were designed to achieve exact values. Simulations using empirical, physical, and process-based techniques do offer another option. The effectiveness of the generated models can be tested by comparison with historic and prehistoric rates of sediment accumulation in coastal lagoons. A small coastal catchment, Lake Wollumboola, located north of Jervis Bay, NSW, was selected for testing simulated soil erosion, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation in combination with GIS, since it offers the opportunity for measurement of sediment accumulation in its terminal lagoon. This integrative approach allows the modelling of soil erosion in coastal catchments as a response to changes in land use.

To the empirical economist there is little guidance from theory about the source of trend behavior and even less guidance about practical formulations. Moreover, recent proximity theorems reveal that trends are more elusive to model empirically than stationary processes, with the upshot that optimal forecasts are also harder to estimate when the data involve trends. These limitations are implicitly acknowledged in much practical modeling and forecasting work, where adaptive methods are often used to help keep models on track as trends evolve. The paper will discuss these issues and limitations of econometrics, introducing a new concept of coordinate cointegration, and offering some thoughts on new practical possibilities for data analysis in the absence of good theory models for trends.

Southern rock lobsters at the puerulus stage are difficult to find, and a stock assessment is economically infeasible. The CPUE series for the fishery has varied widely between 0.50 and 1.17 kg/pot lift in the past. The fishery has experienced catch rates of below 0.91 kg/pot lift for the past eight seasons. This paper explores the possibility of catch prediction using existing monthly catch and fishing effort data from relevant fishing regions in South Australia and Western Australia, and an environmental variable. We show that annual catches are highly correlated with lagged interactions involving catch rate data in May from the central area of the northern zone of the South Australian southern rock lobster fishery and a yearly moving average of the Fremantle Sea Level indicator. The formulation emulates the biological possibility that larvae may be transported from South Australian waters to the Esperance area during a one to two year timeframe. Monthly catches are predicted using a seasonal ARIMAX model, where the transfer function is defined by the annual nonlinear regression specification. The model is validated by forecasting the latest three fishing seasons (1999/2000 to 2001/2002) of catches. The transfer function component is highly significant for the seasonal ARIMAX model.

This generated a wealth of predominantly theoretical research into the behaviour of speculators, for which the results seem to depend critically upon the assumptions. Such theoretical models need to be tested against empirical evidence to determine whether speculators behave in a destabilising manner. Using recent theoretical developments in the literature on modelling financial volatility, this paper tests the significance of speculators and their contributions to describing weekly volatilities across a series of currency, metals and commodity markets. As the time-varying GARCH volatility model and its variants have been criticised for lacking economic content, incorporating speculators into such models contributes to an accommodation of this criticism. The economic implications from establishing the importance of speculators are far-reaching. Policymakers often discuss the imposition of a Tobin tax to curb speculation, so it must be established that speculators behave in economically destructive ways. The inclusion of speculators is also likely to yield superior forecasting models of volatility, and hence more efficient pricing of derivative instruments.",,,,"McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/B-2978-2010",,,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,,,1-74052-098-X,,,,2003,,,,,,,1341,1346,,,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources",,,WOS:000189470800226,,,,,

The problem is to find a set of routes minimising the number of travelled kilometres and the number of used vehicles, while satisfying customer demand. There are three major problems why traditional Operations Research techniques are not enough to deal with this problem, which is known as the Vehicle Routing Problem. First of all, it is inherently combinatorial, and exact algorithms fail when the dimension of the problem (number of customers and orders) reaches a reasonable size. Secondly, the problem can be extended and made more complex in many ways, for instance, adding more than one depot, considering more than one vehicle type, accounting for stochastic customer demand (the exact requested quantity is known only at delivery time), considering time windows during which the customers must be served, taking into account vehicle accessibility restrictions (some customers cannot be served by some vehicles). Finally, the problem can become very different when we consider on-line distribution, that is, we accept delivery orders for lorries which are en route. There, geolocation of customers and vehicles, online data transfer among lorries and the base station, have an impact as great as the solution strategy. In this paper we present DyvOil, a software tool which assists the tour planner during the different stages of fuel distribution, from pre-planning on the basis of reorder forecasts, to online planning, through offline planning based on an advanced metaheuristic such as Ant Colony System.

These improvements are associated at least in part with the multi-category representation of the ice thickness distribution and more realistic parameterization of the ice strength.

Thus, each cell can be treated as a unit with inflows from and outflows to other cells. The proposed model consists of six modules, including hydrology module to calculate runoff and peak flow, wash - off module to simulate pollutant wash - off from crop canopy and surface residue, adsorption module to describe adsorption/desorption processes in the mixing soil layer, pollutant - concentration module to reflect contamination levels in the soil, sediment module to analyze pollutant concentration in sediment leaving the field by runoff, and routing module to route pollutant movement with runoff. The developed model was applied to the Upper Auglaize River Basin that is located in northern Ohio, USA. The principal environmental problem in this basin is non - point source pollution, especially pesticide losses from agricultural fields. Thus, pesticides are the simulation target.

Currently, much research effort is directed to stabilising the perennial grass component of these pastures. This paper evaluates the economic justification of that emphasis. It is argued that trends in livestock production can usefully represent increases or decreases in the stocks of three broad categories of sown pastures that are defined as being those pastures sown to introduced perennial grasses and legumes (perennial grasses), introduced legumes only (legumes), and the total of both these categories. Regression methods were used to determine the changes that have occurred in the livestock production from these pastures that could be explained by changes in a range of economic and other variables. The estimated models were then used to forecast wool, beef and lamb production from each pasture type. The results indicate that changes in prices and costs have influenced the trends in animal production from these pastures and that the structures of these influences have changed over time. Production from perennial grass-legume pastures has remained high relative to production from legume pastures despite adverse cost-price trends. The forecasts indicated a continuation of present levels of perennial grass-legume pasture areas but a decline in production from the legume pastures. The results support the concerns about the continued deterioration in the legume only pastures and the thrust of R&D programs that promote the benefits of perennial grass-legume pastures. The use and analysis of public data to improve understanding of the economic factors that influence the long-term stability of intensively grazed rangelands is highlighted.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,,,,1036-9872,,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2003,25,1,,,,,56,69,,10.1071/RJ03005,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000187554200005,,,,,

The northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, is a model system for forecasting extinction risk in the face of increasing nitrogen deposition. Uptake of N occurs directly from pitcher leaves, which fill with rainwater and prey, and accumulate nutrients. We monitored the demography of two populations of S. purpurea in ombrotrophic bogs of northern New England (USA) and described population growth with a four-stage matrix model. Growth, survivorship, and reproduction were in close balance, and the model predicted population growth rates close to zero, with long doubling times. In a life-table response experiment, we manipulated in situ concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in pitcher plant leaves. At high levels of N and high N:P ratios, population growth rates were significantly depressed. Using local N-deposition records, we forecast different N-deposition scenarios and built a nonstationary population growth model, in which a different transition matrix at each time step reflected the current deposition regime. Autocorrelation in the time series of N deposition rates generated periodic increases in population size superimposed on long-term trends of exponential decline. For a 1% annual increase in N deposition rates, this model predicted a substantial risk of extinction at 100 yr (0.38-0.70), with an estimated population survival time of 160-180 yr.

The distribution of humans among habitats should, as in other animals, be governed by density-dependent feedback on fitness. It should be possible, therefore, to merge human habitat selection - and, perhaps, other adaptive behaviours - with projections of human population size to forecast future threats to biodiversity. We evaluate this deceptively simple postulate by developing a model of human habitat selection. We test it with World Resources Institute (WRI) data and use the resulting pattern to predict threats to biodiversity. Humans select urban over rural habitats in a way that is consistent with an evolutionarily stable strategy of habitat selection. The choice of habitat is modified by per capita energy use. The pattern of habitat use is associated with increased threats to the biodiversity of mammals, birds and higher plants, but not that of reptiles. We use WRI projections of future human populations to predict the anticipated pattern of human habitat use in 2020. We then use the new distribution to calculate changes in threats to biodiversity and rank nations according to their projected threats. African nations rank consistently higher than nations from any other region.

Our review suggests that there is some support for the influence of 4 major, continental-scope factors in limiting or regulating black duck populations: 1) loss in the quantity or quality of breeding habitats; 2) loss in the quantity or quality of wintering habitats; 3) harvest, and 4) interactions (competition, hybridization) with mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during the breeding and/or wintering periods. These factors were used as the basis of an annual life cycle model in which reproduction rates and survival rates were modeled as functions of the above factors, with parameters of the model describing the strength of these relationships. Variation in the model parameter values allows for consideration of scientific uncertainty as to the degree each of these factors may be contributing to declines in black duck populations, and thus allows for the investigation of the possible effects of management (e.g., habitat improvement, harvest reductions) under different assumptions. We then used available, historical data on black duck populations (abundance, annual reproduction rates, and survival rates) and possible driving factors (trends in breeding and wintering habitats, harvest rates, and abundance of mallards). to estimate model parameters. Our estimated reproduction submodel included parameters describing negative density feedback of black ducks, positive influence of breeding habitat, and negative influence of mallard densities; our survival submodel included terms for positive influence of winter habitat on reproduction rates, and negative influences of black duck density (i.e., compensation to harvest mortality). Individual models within each group (reproduction, survival) involved various combinations of these factors, and each was given an information theoretic weight for use in subsequent prediction. The reproduction model with highest AIC weight (0.70) predicted black duck age ratios increasing as a function of decreasing mallard abundance and increasing acreage of breeding habitat; all models considered involved negative density dependence for black ducks. The survival model with highest AIC weight (0.51) predicted nonharvest survival increasing as a function of increasing acreage of wintering habitat and decreasing harvest rates (additive mortality); models involving compensatory mortality effects received approximate to0.12 total weight, vs. 0.88 for additive models. We used the combined model, together with our historical data set, to perform a series of 1-year population forecasts, similar to those that might be performed under adaptive management. Initial model forecasts over-predicted observed breeding populations by approximate to25%. Least-squares calibration reduced the bias to 0.5% under prediction. After calibration, model-averaged predictions over the 16 alternative models (4 reproduction x 4 survival, weighted by AIC model weights) explained 67% of the variation in annual breeding population abundance for black ducks, suggesting that it might have utility as a predictive tool in adaptive management. We investigated the effects of statistical uncertainty in parameter values on predicted population growth rates for the combined annual model, via sensitivity analyses. Parameter sensitivity varied in relation to the parameter values over the estimated confidence intervals, and in relation to harvest rates and mallard abundance. Forecasts of black duck abundance were extremely sensitive to variation in parameter values for the coefficients for breeding and wintering habitat effects. Model-averaged forecasts of black duck abundance were also sensitive to changes in harvest rate and mallard abundance, with rapid declines in black duck abundance predicted for a range of harvest rates and mallard abundance higher than current levels of either factor, but easily envisaged, particularly given current rates of growth for mallard populations. Because of concerns about sensitivity to habitat coefficients, and particularly in light of deficiencies in the historical data used to estimate these parameters, we developed a simplified model that excludes habitat effects. We also developed alternative models involving a calibration adjustment for reproduction rates, survival rates, or neither. Calibration of survival rates performed best (AIC weight 0.59, % BIAS = -0.280, R(2) = 0.679), with reproduction calibration somewhat inferior (AIC weight 0.41, % BIAS = -0.267, R(2) = 0.672); models without calibration received virtually no AIC weight and were discarded. We recommend that the simplified model set (4 biological models x 2 alternative calibration factors) be retained as the best working set of alternative models for research and management. Finally, we provide some preliminary guidance for the development of adaptive harvest management for black ducks, using our working set of models.",,,,"Miller, Mark W./F-6284-2015","Miller, Mark W./0000-0003-4211-1393",,,,,28,30,0,23,,,,0084-0173,,,WILDLIFE MONOGR,Wildl.

Roads or berms with inadequate provision for tidal flow hinder ecosystem functions and interfere with self-maintenance of habitat, because interactions among vegetation, soil, and hydrology within tidally restricted marshes prevent them from responding to sea level rise. Prediction of the tidal range that is expected after restoration relative to the current geomorphology is crucial for successful restoration of salt marsh habitat. Both insufficient (due to restriction) and excessive (due to subsidence and sea level rise) tidal flooding can lead to loss of salt marshes. We developed and applied the Marsh Response to Hydrological Modifications model as a predictive tool to forecast the success of management scenarios for restoring full tides to previously restricted areas. We present an overview of a computer simulation tool that evaluates potential culvert installations with output of expected tidal ranges, water discharges, and flood potentials. For three New England tidal marshes we show species distributions of plants for tidally restricted and nonrestricted areas. Elevation ranges of species are used for short-term (<5 years) predictions of changes to salt marsh habitat after tidal restoration. In addition, elevation changes of the marsh substrate measured at these sites are extrapolated to predict long-term (>5 years) changes in marsh geomorphology under restored tidal regimes. The resultant tidal regime should be designed to provide habitat requirements for salt marsh plants. At sites with substantial elevation losses a balance must be struck that stimulates elevation increases by improving sediment fluxes into marshes while establishing flooding regimes appropriate to sustain the desired plants.",,,,,,,,,,37,41,1,35,,,,1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Information about the Iluka population was reconstructed from various sources, including community knowledge, wildlife carer data, and from a radiotracking program. Modelling scenarios were constructed to identify which factors may be critical to the survival of the Iluka population and which management options could provide the most effective means of its recovery. The model suggested that even substantial improvements in mortality and fertility alone do not prevent the modelled population declining towards extinction. Rebuilding of the koala population is likely to require guaranteed regular immigration of animals of both sexes in conjunction with considerable improvements in population mortality and fertility. This highlights the importance of the metapopulation for recruitment, an outcome that was not expected prior to modelling. These modelling outcomes suggest that the management of small, local populations of koalas will need a concerted management effort focusing on multiple causes of population change.

Location The entire French territory has been studied by dividing it into 301 grid cells of 0.72 x 0.36 degrees. Method Species richness distribution was predicted using generalized linear models to relate the number of species with spatial, topographic and climate variables in grid squares previously identified as well sampled (n = 66). The predictive function includes the curvilinear relationship between variables, interaction terms and the significant third-degree polynomial terms of latitude and longitude. The final model was validated by a jack-knife procedure. The underlying causal factors were investigated by partial regression analysis, decomposing the variation in species richness among spatial, topographic and climate type variables. Results The final model accounts for 86.2% of total deviance, with a mean jack-knife predictive error of 17.7%. The species richness map obtained highlights the Mediterranean as the region richest in species, and the less well-explored south-western region as also being species-rich. The largest fraction of variability (38%) in the number of species is accounted for by the combined effect of the three groups of explanatory variables. The spatially structured climate component explains 21% of variation, while the pure climate and pure spatial components explain 14% and 11%, respectively. The effect of topography was negligible. Conclusions Delimiting the adequately inventoried areas and elaborating forecasting models using simple environmental variables can rapidly produce an estimate of the species richness distribution. Scarabaeidae species richness distribution seems to be mainly influenced by temperature. Minimum mean temperature is the most influential variable on a local scale, while maximum and mean temperature are the most important spatially structured variables. We suggest that species richness variation is mainly conditioned by the failure of many species to go beyond determined temperature range limits.",,,,"Lobo, Jorge M/E-2309-2013","Lobo, Jorge M/0000-0002-3152-4769",,,,,85,89,2,26,,,,0960-7447,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, CWD is the only 1 found in free-ranging species. Because the TSEs include infamous diseases like bovine. spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of humans, CWD by association has become a disease of interest beyond the parochial concerns where it is found. Consequently, wildlife managers are faced with developing programs for addressing CWD. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) are the only species known to be naturally susceptible to CWD. Although implications of CWD are not entirely clear at this time, we know that CWD is a fatal, contagious disease of mature reproductive segments of deer and elk populations. It has been endemic in free-ranging cervids in a core area of contiguous portions of Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado, USA, for a minimum of 20 years and probably longer. The known geographic distribution of endemic CWD is relatively limited at this time, although as results of intensified surveillance become available, this may change. Foci of CWD in free-ranging deer have been identified distant from the core endemic area as far cast as Wisconsin. Distribution has greatly expanded in the last decade or more via commerce in infected farmed elk; as a result, CWD recently has been found in multiple jurisdictions of the plains, foothills, and Rocky Mountains of western North America, and in South Korea. Studies of the biology and natural history of CWD over the last few years have resulted in a better understanding of its pathogenesis and epidemiology. Chronic wasting disease is transmitted horizontally from infected to Susceptible cervids. Early involvement of alimentary tract-associated lymphoid tissues during incubation suggests plausible routes for transmission via feces or saliva. Residual environmental contamination also appears to be important in sustaining epidemics. Studies of CWD epidemiology led to development of models to help explain the history of CWD as well as forecast its impacts on deer and elk populations. Improved tests allow CWD to be diagnosed early in incubation, long before clinical signs appear. Where CWD is not known to occur, managers should be, and in some cases are, developing surveillance programs and regulations that prevent or reduce the likelihood that CWD will be introduced into their jurisdictions. Where CWD is already endemic, responsible agencies are conducting surveillance to assess status and trends in prevalence and geographic distribution, managing deer and elk populations to limit spread, and developing and evaluating techniques for further controlling and perhaps eradicating CWD. Programs for addressing the challenges of CWD management will require interagency cooperation, commitment of funds and personnel, and applied research.",,,,,,,,,,177,183,7,99,,,,0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Forecasting the dynamics of dead trees is a key to incorporating woody debris in managed forests to conserve those species dependent on dead trees. We present a new model for predicting woody-debris dynamics over time using a stage-based matrix, with transition rates between decay classes. It is constructed for use with the type of classification systems commonly used for assessments of dead trees as a plant and animal habitat. Dendrochronological measurements of time since death are the basis for transition rates between decay classes. Calculating mean residence time in decay classes from a single time point sample, rather than using longitudinal long-term data, tends to overestimate residence time due to a higher probability of inclusion of slow-decaying trees. A new method for correcting this bias is presented, and incorporated into the model. The stage-based decay-class model approach is suggested as a general model, applicable to many tree species and forest regions. We illustrate how such a model can be used for management planning for woody debris by forecasting decay-class distributions of woody debris over time at five-year intervals. In combination with functions for growth and mortality, different ways to reach woody-debris goals can be explored. The model is parameterized for Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) in mid-northern Sweden. Because there is a lack of data from long-term studies in similar conditions, model validation is difficult. However, comparisons with available independent data Support the conceptual basis for the model.

We defined each forest sub-compartment or parcel of land in terms of its tree species and age between 1995 and 2015, and categorised each parcel of land as low, moderate or high red squirrel suitability. Resident squirrels may live in more than one habitat patch providing the distance between patches is within the foraging range of the animals and the land between the patches does not act as a barrier to foraging movements. Moreover, squirrels require a minimum area (home range area) of suitable habitat that will provide them with sufficient food resources. To examine these two factors, we explored 120 different model scenarios using three different distances to link patches together and four different sized minimum areas, termed minimum linked areas (MLA), that would hold resident red squirrels, at five year intervals between 1995 and 2015. As an overall measure of suitability, we summed all the MLAs in the reserve for high plus moderate suitability, which we have called the total linked area (TLA), and forecast how this may change in the future. We show that TLA will increase from 39% in 1995 to 67% of the study area by 2015, demonstrating that the reserve will get better for red squirrels over this time. We also demonstrate how changes in forest management would further increase TLA to 82% by 2015. Our results demonstrate how a habitat suitability model operating at the scale of an individual forest, coupled with a GIS and based on an understanding of the species' ecology, provides an objective way of assessing the impact of forest management prescriptions on red squirrel populations.

Muller), slow-growing bed. Scallops were installed in pearl nets at the site of the scallop bed and in a nearby unpopulated site, near the bottom and far from the bottom. With this setup, all groups, except that one near the bottom inside the bed, were free from potential overpopulation effects. In addition, there were two stocking densities to test for containment effects. Shell growth was higher at 2.0 in above the bottom, outside the scallop bed, than at the three other site and height combinations, which were not significantly different from each other. There was a borderline effect of site on soft tissue growth, which was probably slower at the donor site. We conclude that there was no evidence of overpopulation in the scallop bed. On both sites, soft tissue growth was slowest near the bottom, irrespective of group size, intermediate at 2.0 in height, high population density, and fastest at 2.0 m height, low population density. Survivorship was lower near the bottom, but was independent of site and of group size. Available data showed no sustained vertical patterns in phytoplankton concentration in the water column. These results suggest that food depletion occurred in the pearl nets, but that density-independent factors dominated density-dependent factors in the pearl nets near the bottom. Likely explanations involve the interaction between containment effects and current speed variations in the benthic boundary layer. Survivorship decreased with fluctuating asymmetry of the ears of the shells. Fluctuating asymmetry, therefore, may provide a means of including individual effects in growth experiments and forecasting the ability of spat to resist density-independent mortality agents.

The creation and maintenance of spatial and temporal heterogeneity by rivers flowing through floodplain landscapes has been disrupted worldwide by dams and water diversions. Large reservoirs (novel ecosystems) now separate and isolate remnant floodplains (relict ecosystems). From above, these appear as a string of beads, with beads of different sizes and string connections of varying lengths. 2. Numerous studies have documented or forecast sharp declines in riparian biodiversity in relict ecosystems downstream from dams. Concurrently, novel ecosystems containing species and communities of the former predam ecosystems have arisen along all regulated rivers. These result from the creation of new environments caused by upper reservoir sedimentation, tributary sedimentation and the formation of reservoir shorelines. 3. The contribution of novel habitats to the overall biodiversity of regulated rivers has been poorly studied. Novel ecosystems may become relatively more important in supporting riverine biodiversity if relict ecosystems are not restored to predam levels.

Brandt's vole Microtus brandti is considered a pest in China and is actively managed through the use of toxic baits. A time-dependent density-dependent Leslie matrix model was developed to investigate the effectiveness of fertility control as an alternative. 2. Three annual cycles of Brandt's vole were observed between 1995 and 1998 at a site in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. For each of these cycles, cohort-specific monthly survival rates were derived for the spring, summer and autumn months. Over the breeding season, monthly reproductive rates were obtained as numbers of young females per adult female. 3. Survival of voles over winter, a 5-6-month period, depended on age at the onset of winter and the density in autumn. 4. The model was parameterized with measured and continuously varying monthly data for vital rates. It was then used to predict the impact that fertility control, delivered with non-toxic baits, and lethal control would have had on the vole population if control had been imposed in the autumn of 1994 or spring of 1995. The timing and frequency of bait delivery were varied, and we considered the population response to bait that renders females sterile and bait that renders females only temporarily infertile. 5. The model suggested that the effectiveness of lethal control in spring could be matched by fertility control if it was applied twice in the spring of a year in which high densities were reached, or in the previous autumn. The latter requires that (i) infertility is long-lasting in treated animals and (ii) either high-density years be reliably forecast a year ahead or fertility control be applied every autumn. 6. Brandt's voles provide an exception to the general rule that fertility control is never more effective than lethal control applied at the same time with the same bait uptake. We found that when control was applied in autumn, fertility control was better than lethal control in reducing the numbers of voles over the following spring, summer and autumn. This is because normal density-dependent mortality over winter has a greater impact following fertility control than lethal control.",,,,,,,,,,32,64,0,13,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J. Appl.

Usually the best data available for constructing such models comes from intensive, detailed field studies. Models, thus implicitly developed at the fine spatial resolution of experimental studies, are then scaled-up to coarser resolution for management decision-making. Typically, this process of scaling-up involves merely adapting the models computer code for data input so that it will accept the large scale spatial averages (often derived from relatively remote (e.g. aerial) sensing) that form the basis for management planning. Unfortunately, such scaling-up can inadvertently affect model predictions and dynamical behavior. Improper incorporation of data collected at multiple resolutions during model development and use, and misinterpretation of model output can result. The consequences of scaling-up a linear, second-order, autoregressive. time series model of spruce budworm population dynamics on the model's predictions and on the interpretation of the model's output are considered. Such time series models have been proposed as templates for incorporating outbreak dynamics in the decision systems supporting forest insect management that tire currently being adapted to climatic change problems. Analysis of the underlying deterministic component of the time series model showed that: (1) parameter estimates changed with the spatial resolution-parameter values estimated from time series data consisting of large area averages were negatively correlated (r = -0.931, P<0.0005) and as much as 40 or 50 times greater in absolute value than the parameters generating the fine resolution data from sampling sites 1600 times smaller in extent. (2) Even the qualitative nature of the dynamics appeared to change in response to scaling-up. The long cycle, converging oscillations generated at fine resolutions gave way to five additional types of qualitative behavior at coarser resolutions including various types of divergent behavior and non-oscillating behavior. (3) The amount of distortion involved in scaling-up depends on the model's degree of non-linearity and on the fine scale spatial variation in population densities. An approach to correcting for such distortion is outlined. The potential consequences of scaling-up deserve consideration whenever data measured at different spatial resolutions are integrated during model development. as often happens in climate change research.

The work focussed on a fragmented forest in south-eastern Australia comprised of a network of 39 patches of native eucalypt forest surrounded by extensive stands of exotic softwood Radiata Pine (Pinus radiata) plantation. A range of modelling scenarios were completed in which four broad factors were varied: (1) inter-patch variation in habitat quality; (2) the Pattern of inter-patch dispersal; (3) the rate of interpatch dispersal; and (4) the population sink effects of the Radiata Pine matrix that surrounded the eucalypt patches. Model predictions were made for the total number of animals, the distribution of animal density among patches, the total number of occupied patches, and the probability of patch occupancy. Predictions were then compared with observed values for these same measures based on extensive field surveys of small mammals in the patch system. For most models for the Bush Rat, the predicted relative density of animals per patch correlated well with the values estimated from field surveys. Predictions of patch occupancy were not significantly different from the actual value for the number of occupied patches in half the models tested. The better models explained 10-16% of the log-likelihood of the probability of patch occupancy. While some of the models gave reasonable forecasts of the number of occupied patches, even in these cases, they had only moderate ability to predict which patches were occupied. Field surveys revealed there was no relationship between patch area and population density for the Agile Antechinus-an outcome correctly predicted by only a few models. Five of the 18 scenarios completed for the Agile Antechinus gave predicted numbers of occupied patches not significantly different from the observed number. In each of these five cases, large standard deviations around the mean predicted value meant uncertainty generated by the simulation model limited the predictive power of the PVA. Some of the models gave reasonable predictions for the number of occupied patches, but those models were unable to predict which ones were actually occupied. The results of our study suggest that key processes influencing which specific patches would be occupied were not modelled appropriately. High levels of variability and fecundity drive the population dynamics of the Bush Rat and Agile Antechinus, making the patch system unpredictable and difficult to model accurately. Despite the fact that both the Bush Rat and the Agile Antechinus are two of the most studied mammals in Australia, there are attributes of their biology that are presently poorly understood (which were not included in the VORTEX model), but which could strongly influence patch occupancy. For example, local landscape features may be important determinants of inter-patch movement and habitat utilisation in the patch system. Further empirical studies are needed to explore this aspect of small mammal biology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using high-resolution lake-sediment records from the northern Great Plains, we show pronounced 100- to 130-yr drought cycles during the arid middle Holocene (8000 calendar yr BP). During drought phases, grass productivity declined, erosion and forbs increased, and fuel limitation reduced fire importance. Intervening humid decades saw grass production rise, with stabilization of soils and renewed fire as fuels became abundant. Although both C-3 and C-4 grasses declined during droughts, a lasting shift to C-3 dominance occurred during a single drought similar to8200 calendar yr BP During the more humid Late Holocene (2800 calendar yr BP), climate was less variable and without evident drought cyclicity. Consequently, drought severity during past, and possibly future, arid phases cannot be anticipated from the attenuated climate variability evident during contemporary humid phases. Our study demonstrates that agriculturally important grassland ecosystems respond sensitively to drought variability, uncertainty in which has profound implications for the future of these ecosystems.",,,,"Grimm, Eric/G-3011-2013; Clark, James S./G-6331-2011","Engstrom, Daniel/0000-0002-8066-029X",,,,,108,112,3,40,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2002,83,3,,,,,595,601,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0595:DCALRT]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000173967500001,,,,,

Understanding the processes responsible for this additional source of S is critical to quantifying ecosystem response to ongoing and potential future controls on SO2 emission. An integrated biogeochemical model, PnET-BGC, was used to investigate inputs and dynamics of S in a northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA. The changes in soil S pools and stream-water SO42- were simulated to assess the response to both atmospheric S deposition and forest clear-cutting disturbances. Model simulation using the measured dry-to-bulk deposition ratio of 0.21 resulted in an underprediction of soil S pools and stream-water SO42- concentrations in the biogeochemical reference watershed (Watershed 6). However, the depiction of biotic processes (e.g., plant uptake, mineralization) in the model reduced the discrepancy in stream SO42- concentration between measured and model predicted value by similar to50% compared to a previous modeling effort that only considered abiotic processes. Long-term simulations (similar to150 yr) indicated that elevated anthropogenic S deposition has increased stream SO42- concentrations and enhanced the incorporation of S in absorbed SO42- and organic S soil pools. Following the implementation of the 1970 and 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, decreases in S deposition resulted in the net release of S from soil pools, including soil organic S. Model simulation of forest clear-cutting of Watershed 5 at the HBEF showed that NO3- leaching and associated acidification following this disturbance increased adsorption of SO42- to soil. Compared to the reference watershed, stream-water SO42- concentrations were slightly higher, and soil adsorbed SO42- pools were substantially higher in the clear-cut watershed 4-5 yr after disturbance. Simulation of stable S isotopes showed that fractionation associated with the mineralization of soil organic S might explain the depletion in S-34 observed between throughfall and stream water in the reference watershed. There is a need for further research on: (1) the rates of dry S deposition and (2) the rate of weathering of various minerals and the isotopic composition of these minerals in order to fully assess the discrepancy (i.e., greater export of S than can be accounted for by atmospheric deposition) in watershed S mass balances. The results of forecasts of the future response to anticipated decreases in S deposition are highly dependent on the nature of this additional source of S to forest watersheds. However, the large size and relatively long turnover time of soil organic S pools compared to adsorbed SO42- pools suggest that a model depicting only abiotic processes will not be suitable for predicting the long-term recovery of stream water from acidification by atmospheric deposition in northern forests.",,,,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890",,,,,24,24,0,18,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We explored the same relationships through time, considering the natural variations of ANPP and climate for 11 yr. Based on NOAA/AVHRR satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, we evaluated the effects of climate on annual and seasonal ANPP across regional gradients of precipitation (100-500 mm/yr) and temperature (-1degrees-9degreesC of annual mean). We studied ANPP climatic controls through time at four sites using NDVI and meteorological data. We used annual NDVI integral as a surrogate of annual ANPP. Annual NDVI integral increased linearly along regional gradients of precipitation, and its annual variability decreased exponentially. Annual NDVI integral was, in most cases, unrelated to precipitation through time. We described the seasonality, of ANPP using four variables derived from seasonal NDVI curves: the dates of growing season start and end, the date of maximum NDVI, and the length of the growing season. The growing season started later toward the cold extreme of the regional temperature gradients and, within a given site through time, during the coldest years. The dates of maximum NDVI and end of the growing season occurred later toward the humid or cold extremes of the regional gradients, whereas the length of the growing season was positively affected by precipitation and temperature along these gradients. These variables were not associated with climate through time. The response of the start of the growing season to temperature was greater in time, following the natural climatic fluctuations, than in space, accompanying regional temperature gradients. This difference probably resulted because the time required for shifts in community composition and plant adaptation is longer than one year. Climatic determinants of ANPP shifted from precipitation alone to precipitation plus temperature when the temporal scale of analysis changed from annual to seasonal. Our results indicate the feasibility of forecasting forage availability a few months prior to the beginning of the growing season, but not during the whole year. Longer term data sets and manipulative experiments are required to forecast annual ANPP and predict its response to climate change.",,,,"Jobbagy, Esteban Gabriel/A-6293-2010","Jobbagy, Esteban Gabriel/0000-0002-4214-6011; Sala, Osvaldo/0000-0003-0142-9450; Paruelo, Jose Maria/0000-0002-8784-9431",,,,,174,204,6,83,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2002,83,2,,,,,307,319,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0307:PACOPP]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000173538800002,,,,,

The brown locust Locustana pardalina is a major agricultural pest in southern Africa, with populations periodically reaching plague proportions. Management and control would benefit from a predictive capacity at seasonal time scales, as yet unavailable. 2. The results of a study into the dynamics and potential predictability of locust populations in southern Africa are presented here. The number of districts reporting locust control measures was used as a proxy for swarming brown locust populations. 3. Spectral analysis of the annual number of brown locust infestations over southern Africa revealed dominant periodicity at 17.3 years. The data were low-pass filtered and the low-frequency and high-frequency components were retained. The low-frequency component led the observed 18-year cycle in southern African rainfall by about 3 years, and was therefore likely to reflect endogenous controls on populations. 4. Variability in the interannual high-frequency component of brown locust infestations was strongly related to rainfall over the Karoo and Eastern Cape regions of South Africa. The highest correlations were with rainfall over the 12 months prior to the locust season (r = 0.64) and in particular with rainfall during December (r = 0.55). 5. Evidence is presented that the high-frequency component is related to the Pacific El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and that high-frequency locust activity is abnormally high (low) during La Nina (El Nino) events. 6. The high-frequency component of locust activity correlates positively and negatively, respectively, with sea-surface temperatures over the tropical western and eastern Pacific Ocean many months in advance of the locust season. Activity also correlates positively (negatively) with sea-surface temperatures over the south-west Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean (west and north-west Indian Ocean). These relationships occur later than those in the Pacific, developing in the austral winter and peaking in early summer. This pattern of correlations and the associated atmospheric circulation anomalies is consistent with ENSO-related and non-ENSO related patterns of climate variability. 7. The results suggest that there may be considerable scope for future development of models for the seasonal prediction of brown locust activity in which high-frequency variability is related to climatic indices.",,,,"todd, martin/I-4143-2015; Cheke, Robert/AAF-5017-2020","Cheke, Robert/0000-0002-7437-1934; Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614",,,,,52,56,1,12,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The methodology described in Genovese et al. (2001) consists of extracting yield indicators from CNDVI (CORINE-NDVI) time series at a regional scale. In Genovese et al. (2001), a preliminary study on Spain for a four year span (1995-1998) has shown that indicators extracted from the CNDVI profiles can be more closely related to crop yield performances than indicators based on simple NDVI profiles. To prove the validity of this approach, a more complete experiment was realised on France for the same period.

From research carried out by individual scientists and a focus on publication of results in the scientific literature, there is a rapid trend towards large-scale research projects carried out by interdisciplinary teams, which are focused on achieving outcomes. Liaison with government and the community is essential if science is to make difference on the ground through the adoption of changed management and farming practices. At larger and larger spatial scales, complex interactions between science, economics, and society are being explored in order to provide a sound basis for the analysis of a range of management techniques. Economic instruments, such as the valuation of ecosystem services, are being widely employed to provide improved NRM policies and practices. Various kinds of innovative modeling techniques are being employed to summarize knowledge and to provide forecasting capabilities including various forms of dynamic and agent-based modeling. The challenge lies in finding solutions to the problems of communication between a wide range of disciplines and communities and in building models which incorporate a range of data sets and types. The ""social engineering"" and networking (""soft"" science) required to build and sustain teams is as onerous and important as the task of building and maintaining models of various kinds (the ""hard"" science). Ecological science is being challenged to contribute to the development of a more sustainable human society in terms of the ""triple bottom line"" - ecological, economic, and social sustainability.

Even though rarely used by ecologists, gravity models allow estimation of long-distance dispersal between discrete points in heterogeneous landscapes. We developed a production-constrained gravity model to forecast zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) dispersal into inland lakes of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin (USA) based on the site and location of lakes and the number and location of boats within 364 counties. A deterministic form of this model was used to estimate best-fit parameters for distance coefficient, Great Lakes boat-ramp attractiveness, and colonization Cutoff threshold. A stochastic model thus developed from these parameters allows for random changes in colonization likelihood. The results of our model are highly correlated with the actual pattern of colonized lakes in southern Michigan and southeastern Wisconsin at the end of 1997. Areas of central Wisconsin and western Michigan, where zebra mussel colonies have not been documented, were also predicted to be colonized, suggesting that future invasions may be imminent in these locations.

In most instances, multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm have been used. The major shortcoming of this approach is that the knowledge contained in the trained networks is difficult to interpret. One way to increase model transparency is to use neurofuzzy approaches, which enable the information that is stored in trained networks to be expressed in the form of a fuzzy rule base. In this paper, B-spline associative memory networks (AMNs), which have been shown to be learning equivalent to certain types of fuzzy models, are used to forecast concentrations of the cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia, 4 weeks in advance. The ASMOD (adaptive spline modeling of observation data) algorithm is used to optimise the model structure and the number of model inputs. The sensitivity of the model to the order of the basis functions and a number of stopping criteria is investigated. The performance of the various models is assessed in terms of forecasting accuracy and model transparency, and compared with that of a MLP model developed in a previous study. It is found that lower order basis functions and Bayes' Information Criterion (BIC) give the best model performance, both in terms of forecasting accuracy and transparency. The accuracy of the forecasts obtained using the B-spline AMN and MLP models is comparable, although the AMN may be considered to perform marginally better overall. In addition, the AMN provides more explicit information about the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. The fuzzy rules obtained from the AMN model suggest that incidences of Anabaena spp. generally occur after the passing of a flood hydrograph and when water temperatures are high.

While SALMO is driven by process-based differential equations, the model ANNA is designed as recurrent feedforward neural network trained by time series data. Predictions of chlorophyll-a for the years 1979-1982 by both models were validated by means of measured data. Results showed that SALMO is able to predict annual average trends not only of chlorophyll-a but other chemical and biological state variables as well. It supports decision making by evaluating alternative scenarios for strategic eutrophication control. The model ANNA achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting timing and magnitudes of algal biomass up to 7 days ahead. The recurrent feedforward architecture of ANNA proved to be most efficient in order to model and predict seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its forecasting results can be utilized for early warning and tactical control of algal blooms in freshwater lakes. A sensitivity analysis conducted by ANNA revealed that algal abundance in Burrinjuck Reservoir is not only driven by physical and chemical characteristics of the water body but to a large extend by hydrological characteristics such as water depth as well.

In this study, mortality data were analysed from 11-year permanent plot records in 10 tracts of hemlock-hardwood forest with little past human disturbance in the upper Great Lakes region, USA. 2 We compared tree size-mortality trends in mature stands (canopy trees mostly 100-170 years old) with those in true old-growth stands (canopy trees mostly 200-350 years old). Stem sections were also cut from 71 recently fallen trees to determine average and maximum longevity for canopy trees of each species. 3 All five mature stands had descending monotonic size-mortality trends for shade-tolerant species, with low rates of mortality (generally much less than 1% per year) for trees > 18 cm d.b.h. In contrast, all five old-growth stands had U-shaped mortality functions, with annual mortality rates of 1.5-2.9% for trees > 66 cm d.b.h. These size-mortality trends are biologically consistent with 'rotated sigmoid' size distributions observed for major species, although mortality rates were nearly size-invariant for trees between 18 and 66 cm d.b.h. 4 Both late-successional and gap-phase species had fairly high mortality rates for saplings (2-10 cm d.b.h.) of 25-34% over the 11-year period, which suggests that size distributions with moderately steep negative slopes are needed to compensate for mortality and ensure population sustainability. 5 Average age at time of death for canopy trees was 216 years for sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and 301 years for hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), suggesting that the biological transition from mature to old-growth forest probably doesn't occur on these sites until a stand age of about 180-250 years.",,,,,,,,,,115,120,2,26,,,,0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The results indicated that it is possible to predict wheat production in low rainfall area using only the rainfall, temperature and area data available in the earlier months of the growing season. Analysis showed that rainfall was the major factor in increasing wheat production. Interestingly, yield predictions made at the end of January, i.e. including the rainfall in January, are no better than those made at the end of December. An additional 10-mm precipitated in December or January will increase wheat production by 6(.)2 % and 13(.)1 %, respectively.

Here I calibrate and evaluate a risk algorithm for frit fly infestation in spring-sown oats, aiming to improve damage forecasts and assess the profitability of different control strategies with regard to regional infestation prevalence. Oat fields in two regions in Sweden with high and low frequencies of infestation were surveyed for 11 and 13 yr, respectively. The surveyed fields were classified either as infested or noninfested, depending on whether or not the infestation level exceeded the economic threshold. The relation between various risk factors and frit fly damage was examined by logistic regression, and risk points were assigned to significant factors. Regional action thresholds (risk point sums) resulting in the lowest average costs were calculated. In regions where pest outbreaks are common, a control strategy based on the proposed risk algorithm was more profitable than prophylactic or no sprays. The percentage of sprayed fields was reduced to < 50%, compared with routine use of pesticides. In low-risk regions, the profitability of the forecasting strategy and the no-control alternative were similar. The predictive accuracy of the risk algorithm was higher than that of a commonly used degree-day model, especially in regions where the frit fly is a minor pest. Based on these results, I suggest that use of the proposed risk algorithm can enhance the farmer's understanding of the biology of this insect pest, increase profitability, and reduce unnecessary use of pesticides. Long-term monitoring of pest and environmental data can facilitate not only on-farm pest control decisions, but can also provide essential information for developing regional pest control strategies.",,,,,,,,,,3,4,1,16,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The framework for OOD encompassing modularity, encapsulation, interface and inheritance is used to abstract a forest management system in a modular way. We presented that using OOD approaches, a forest management model can be developed generically enough to accommodate various components of forest management modeling. The model framework is flexible and can be updated with relative efficiency, as the system design components are modularized and less independent than those designed with conventional approaches. We identified the basic components and discussed in detail their interface and behavior (functions) in a typical forest management planning process with three distinct modeling approaches; simulation, optimization and meta heuristics. We established OO management design framework which is both generic enough to provide the fundamental services to any types of forest management modeling such as simulation optimization and meta heuristics - however, we demonstrated the latter - and capable of providing specific services such as handling forest development patterns, forming strategies, forecasting and reporting forest changes. We concludes that the OOD approach for abstracting forest management design process allows a great deal of flexibility in constructing flexible, extensible, and adaptable forest management decision support systems tools and provides important information essential for the sustainable management of forested ecosystems.

The reanalysis system merges observations from airplanes, land stations, satellites, ships, and weather balloons with output from a weather-forecast model to create global fields of atmospheric variables. Station data consisted of temperature and precipitation measured with thermometers and rain gauges at fixed locations. Temperatures were near normal in Colorado when the amphibian declines occurred In the 1970s, whereas in Central America temperatures were warmer than normal, especially during the dry season. The station data from Puerto Rico and Australia indicated that temperatures were above normal during the period of amphibian declines, but reanalysis did not show such a clear temperature signal, Although declines occurred while the temperature and precipitation anomalies in some of the regions were large and of extended duration, the anomalies were not beyond the range of normal variability. Thus, unusual climate, as measured by regional estimates of temperature and precipitation, is unlikely to be the direct cause of amphibian declines, but it may have indirectly contributed to them. Previous researchers have noted that the declines appear to have propagated from northwest to southeast from Costa Rica to Panama and from southeast to northwest in Queensland, Australia, Wind has the potential to transport pathogens that cause amphibian mortality. The mean direction of the near-surface winds tended to parallel the path of amphibian declines from July-October in Central America and from May-July in Australia. The wind direction was highly variable, however, and the propagation rate of amphibian declines was much slower than the mean wind speed. In addition, the most likely pathogen is a chytrid fungus then does not produce desiccation-resistant spores.

The benefits to humans of renewable fresh water include water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial uses, for production of fish and waterfowl, and for such instream uses as recreation, transportation, and waste disposal. In the coming century, climate change and a growing imbalance among freshwater supply, consumption, and population will alter the water cycle dramatically. Many regions of the world are already limited by the amount and quality of available water. In the next 30 yr alone, accessible runoff is unlikely to increase more than 10%, but the earth's population is projected to rise by approximately one-third. Unless the efficiency of water use rises, this imbalance will reduce freshwater ecosystem services, increase the number of aquatic species facing extinction, and further fragment wetlands, rivers, deltas, and estuaries. Based on the scientific evidence currently available, we conclude that: (1) over half of accessible freshwater runoff globally is already appropriated for human use; (2) more than 1 x 10(9) people currently lack access to clean drinking water and almost 3 x 10(9) people lack basic sanitation services; (3) because the human population will grow faster than increases in the amount of accessible fresh water, per capita availability of fresh water will decrease in the coming century; (4) climate change will cause a general intensification of the earth's hydrological cycle in the next 100 yr, with generally increased precipitation, evapotranspiration, and occurrence of storms, and significant changes in biogeochemical processes influencing water quality; (5) at least 90% of total water discharge from U.S. rivers is strongly affected by channel fragmentation from dams, reservoirs, interbasin diversions, and irrigation; and (6) globally, 20% of freshwater fish species are threatened or extinct, and freshwater species make up 47% of all animals federally endangered in the United States. The growing demands on freshwater resources create an urgent need to link research with improved water management. Better monitoring, assessment, and forecasting of water resources will help to allocate water more efficiently among competing needs, Currently in the United States, at least six federal departments and 20 agencies share responsibilities for various aspects of the hydrologic cycle. Coordination by a single panel with members drawn from each department, or by a central agency, would acknowledge the diverse pressures on freshwater systems and could lead to the development of a well-coordinated national plan.",,,,"Naiman, Robert/K-3113-2012","MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533",,,,,489,513,30,654,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Commercial catch data of red cod were used as indices of relative recruitment strength for New Zealand fish stocks (east coast South Island, RCO 3; west coast South Island, RCO 7). Analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE) supports the assumption that fluctuations in commercial catches reflect changes in abundance resulting from variable recruitment. Catch was assessed against 34 environmental variables that included the Southern Oscillation index, sea surface temperature, weather types, wind speed and direction, and river flows. Lagged correlations were calculated between annual commercial catch and averaged environmental data. Variables most strongly correlated with commercial catch were included in regression analyses. Regression models were calculated using all available data in its raw form, and after application of a logarithmic transformation. Robustness, and forecast skill was tested using a repeated leave-one-out procedure. The strongest correlations between commercial catch and explanatory variables for both RCO 3 and RCO 7 were consistently with sea surface temperature over a wide range of time lags followed by frequencies of southwest and northeast flow patterns. The correlations generally operated in the sense that 'colder is better': negative correlations (similar to -0.75) with sea surface temperature, positive with the occurrence of cool southwest weather types, negative with the occurrence of warm northeast weather types. The maximum magnitude of the correlation occurs at 14-month lag for both fisheries, corresponding to the late spring/summer of the year prior to the catch year. There were often secondary maxima in the magnitude of the correlations two or three years prior to the catch year. The commercial fishery is made up largely of two and three-year-old fish, implying that juvenile fish (age similar to one year) are most sensitive to environmental conditions, but egg, embryo and larva periods may also be affected. Regression analyses suggest that two-predictor regressions were unstable, with often large decreases in explained variance when applied to the independent years, however, at the lags when relationships are strongest (around 14 months), the explained variance on the left-out years remains high. Fluctuations in red cod landings are dependent on sea surface temperature, controlled largely by climatic variability, including El Nino and La Nina events. For short-lived species such as red cod, fluctuations in annual landings are commonplace and analyses of environmental data may be useful in predicting catches in subsequent years.",,,,,"Renwick, James/0000-0002-9141-2486",,,,,19,19,0,8,,,,0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Among the demographic factors that influence individual survival and reproduction, the composition of social groups can play an important role. Census data drawn from 26 populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.) were used to determine if the composition of groups explained variation in their reproductive performance. Each group's reproductive performance was estimated by calculating the difference between the observed number of immatures and the number expected from its population average. Of four group structure variables tested, only one - the residual of the adult and subadult sex ratio - was a consistent correlate of reproductive performance across the howler monkey populations. Groups with a greater proportion of adult and subadult males contained more juveniles than expected from the population average. I propose that the survival or retention of immatures within howler monkey groups depends in part on the behavior of resident males. Of particular importance, the relative proportions of resident males and females were more informative than the absolute number of males or females. On this: basis, I evaluate the possible role of males in protection from predation, conspecific aggression, and resource competition.

The development of salt marsh vegetation was simulated separately for C3 and C4 plants, using a combined biogeochemical and demographic model. This simulation, which provided small-scale (m(2)) results of annual above-ground primary production, was upscaled to the whole salt marsh area, using bathymetry data, remote sensing and Geographic information System (GIS) for assessing vegetation cover and determining areal distribution of C3 and C4 vegetation. Based on IPCC data, several sea-level rise scenarios were considered, and the coupled ecological model-GIS were applied to these in order to determine changes in global salt marsh productivity. The results indicate that the salt marshes of the mesotidal estuaries such as the Tagus are susceptible to sea-level rise only in a worst case scenario, which is more likely to occur if the terms set out by the Kyoto protocol are not met by several industrialised nations. The low vulnerability of salt marshes supports the suggestion that areas with high tidal ranges are less vulnerable to sea level change, due to greater sediment transport and accretion. Nevertheless, the precautionary principle should always be applied by coastal planners, due to the great uncertainty surrounding forecasts of sea-level rise. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We followed a linked modeling approach that used a specialized reservoir water quality model to forecast operation-induced changes in phytoplankton production. A food web-energy transfer model was also applied to propagate predicted changes in phytoplankton up through the food web to the predators and sport fishes of interest. The food web-energy transfer model employed a 10% trophic transfer efficiency through a food web that was mapped using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope analysis provided an efficient and comprehensive means of estimating the structure of the reservoir's food web with minimal sampling and background data. We used an optimization procedure to estimate the diet proportions of all food web components simultaneously from their isotopic signatures. Some consumers were estimated to be much more sensitive than others to perturbations to phytoplankton supply. The linked modeling approach demonstrated that interdisciplinary efforts enhance the value of information obtained from studies of managed ecosystems. The approach exploited the strengths of engineering and ecological modeling methods to address concerns that neither of the models could have addressed alone: (a) the water quality model could not have addressed quantitatively the possible impacts to fish, and (b) the food web model could not have examined how phyto plankton availability might change due to reservoir operations.",,,,"Saito, Laurel/E-3096-2010","Saito, Laurel/0000-0003-3617-3133",,,,,50,69,2,65,,,,1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,MAR,2001,4,2,,,,,105,125,,10.1007/s100210000062,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000168370100002,,,,,

ALEX was used to predict patch occupancy by the laughing kookkaburra and the sacred kingfisher in patches of eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. These predictions were compared to field surveys to determine the accuracy of the model. Predictions also were compared to a ""naive"" null model assuming no fragmentation effects. The naive null model significantly over-predicted the number of eucalypt patches occupied by the sacred kingfisher, but the observed patch occupancy was not significantly different from that predicted using ALEX. ALEX produced a better fit to the field data than the naive null model for the number of patches occupied by the laughing kookaburra. Nevertheless, ALEX still significantly over-predicted the number of occupied patches, particularly remnants dominated by certain forest types ribbon gum and narrow-leaved peppermint. The predictions remained significantly different from observations, even when the habitat quality of these patches was reduced to zero. Changing the rate of dispersal improved overall predicted patch occupancy, but occupancy rates for the different forest types remained significantly different from the field observations. The lack of congruence between field data and model predictions could have arisen because the laughing kookaburra may move between an array of patches to access spatially separated food and nesting resources in response to fragmentation. Alternatively, inter-specific competition may be heightened in a fragmented habitat. These types of responses to fragmentation are not incorporated as part of traditionally applied metapopulation models. Assessments of predictions from PVA models are rare but important because they can reveal the types of species for which forecasts are accurate and those for which they are not.

We built an age-structured model of the population and analyzed the effect of variation in demographic parameters on population growth. Elasticity analysis demonstrated that variation in mortality has a more pronounced effect on instantaneous growth rate than an equivalent variation in fecundity. We examined the effects of environmental variability, inbreeding and catastrophes on population viability by a computer simulation using the VORTEX PVA programme. In the stochastic model, the most important factor affecting extinction risk was variability in mortality rates, in particular of the adult classes.

Although population viability analysis (PVA) is widely employed, forecasts from PVA models are rarely tested. This study in a fragmented forest in southern Australia contrasted field data on patch occupancy and abundance for the arboreal marsupial greater glider Petauroides volans with predictions from a generic spatially explicit PVA model. This work represents one of the first landscape-scale tests of its type. 2. Initially we contrasted field data from a set of eucalypt forest patches totalling 437 ha with a naive null model in which forecasts of patch occupancy were made, assuming no fragmentation effects and based simply on remnant area and measured densities derived from nearby unfragmented forest. The naive null model predicted an average total of approximately 170 greater gliders, considerably greater than the true count (n = 81). 3. Congruence was examined between field data and predictions from PVA under several metapopulation modelling scenarios. The metapopulation models performed better than the naive null model. Logistic regression showed highly significant positive relationships between predicted and actual patch occupancy for the four scenarios (P = 0.001-0.006). When the model-derived probability of patch occupancy was high (0.50-0.75, 0.75-1.00), there was greater congruence between actual patch occupancy and the predicted probability of occupancy. 4. For many patches, probability distribution functions indicated that model predictions for animal abundance in a given patch were not outside those expected by chance. However, for some patches the model either substantially over-predicted or under-predicted actual abundance. Some important processes, such as inter-patch dispersal, that influence the distribution and abundance of the greater glider may not have been adequately modelled. 5. Additional landscape-scale tests of PVA models, on a wider range of species, are required to assess further predictions made using these tools. This will help determine those taxa for which predictions are and are not accurate and give insights for improving models for applied conservation management.",,,,"Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017; /R-8310-2019; /B-1337-2008; McCarthy, Michael/O-5655-2014","Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; /0000-0001-7755-996X; /0000-0001-7755-996X; McCarthy, Michael/0000-0003-1039-7980",,,,,21,22,0,12,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In the present paper, the question is asked: 'is research based on evolutionary perspectives in general, and life history theory specifically, really useful for dealing with insect pests?' Perhaps such theory-based research is rather a luxury: time and resources would be better spent on entirely applied aspects of the problem. The conclusion of the present discussion is that having an evolutionary perspective guiding research is actually a very cost-effective way of dealing with applied problems, as it provides a clear basis for interpretations, generalizations and predictions. Life history theory is a very central and necessary part of both population ecology and general evolutionary theory, and its specific usefulness in pest forecasting and management are discussed. Nevertheless, our ability to predict insect population dynamics is still limited, and so is our ability to make use of an insect's life history traits to predict its propensity to become a pest. I suggest that the former shortcoming is largely due to poor understanding of insect life history plasticity. This, in turn, may partly be due to a paucity of studies where reaction norms are investigated as putative adaptations. I suggest that the latter shortcoming is due to problems inherent with studying life history traits as adaptations, for example the lack of an independent fitness model and the fact that life histories tend to form syndromes of coadapted traits. These points are illustrated with examples from my own work on non-pest butterflies and from insect-Eucalyptus systems.",,,,"Nylin, Soren/B-7375-2008","Nylin, Soren/0000-0003-4195-8920",,,,,30,33,0,12,,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,,2001,26,5,,,,,507,517,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2001.01134.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000171408600009,,,,,

Our objectives were to describe seasonal, scale-dependent caribou-habitat relationships and to provide a means for their integration with forest planning. Between 1992 and 1999, 60 caribou were radiolocated 3,775 times in the north Columbia Mountains of British Columbia. We analyzed caribou selection for multiple forest overstory and terrain attributes across 4 nested spatial scales, comparing successively smaller and closer paired landscapes (used and random). Seasonal habitat selection varied with scale for most attributes. During early winter, caribou preferred broad landscapes of low elevation, gentle terrain, high productivity, high canopy cover, and old and young forests of species indicative of a relatively mild, dry climate. Finer-scale preferences were for old western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata) stands, high canopy closure, high productivity, and southern aspects. During late winter, caribou preferred broad landscapes of high elevation, northern aspects, and old Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands. Overstory preferences were similar at fine scales, coupled with low canopy closure and productivity, high elevations, and gentle terrain. During spring, caribou preferred broad landscapes of young and old closed canopy cedar, hemlock, and spruce forests of high productivity at low elevations. Preferences were similar at finer scales but included gentle slopes. Summer preferences included closed canopy, old spruce and subalpine fir forests of high productivity across scales. north and east aspects at broad scales, and gentle terrain at fine scales.

In addition, CEM does not assess the value to bears of small areas left between zones of human disturbance. We developed a predictive GIS based model of adult female grizzly bear security areas in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains to provide agency planners with a tool that addresses these shortfalls. Our study area included 4 major jurisdictions: Alberta provincial lands, British Columbia provincial lands, Kananaskis Country improvement district in Alberta, and National Park lands in both provinces. Starting with the total land base in each jurisdiction, we progressively removed areas of unsuitable habitat (e.g., rock and ice), habitat within 500 m of high human use (>100 human visits/month), and areas of insufficient size based on an average daily feeding radius (polygons <9 km(2)). We identified the remaining lands as secure areas. We then tested the hypothesis that female grizzly bear use of security areas differs from the landscape as a whole based on radio telemetry data. Of the 4 jurisdictions in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains, the largest percent of secure habitat was on British Columbia provincial lands. Of the land surface area of the Banff, Yoho, and Kootenay National Parks, 48% is unsuitable for grizzly bears, primarily because it is composed of rock and ice. This is unfortunate, because it is assumed that these national parks form productive core refugia for grizzly bears. By reconstructing past human use and forecasting into the future for Banff National Park and Kananaskis Country, we demonstrate progressive loss of security areas. We found that an average of 69% of the land within grizzly bear home ranges was secure using our sample of 28 radiocollared adult females. Resource selection indices from these bears demonstrated selection of security areas within their home ranges. Existing mortality and translocation data, combined with our findings of low security and high habitat fragmentation within some adult female home ranges, give quantitative substance to the assertion that grizzly bears in and around Banff National Park and Kananaskis Country exist in one of the most human-dominated landscapes where they still survive.

Typhoons, floods, and droughts caused 82.4% of the total Philippine rice losses from 1970 to 1990. In 1990 alone, domestic losses due to climatic constraints amounted to US$ 39.2 million. Weather aberrations, climatic fluctuations such as El Nino, and the growing concern for their effects on agriculture have stimulated academic, public and policy-level interests on the analysis of the impacts of climate variability on agricultural production systems. This paper is presented to discuss the agronomic impacts of climate variability on rice production in the Philippines. Long-term climate variability influences sowing date, crop duration, crop yield, and the management practices adapted in rice production. Short-term weather episodes can also affect yield by inducing changes in temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and moisture availability. The degree of vulnerability of crops to climate variability depends mainly on the development stage of the crops at the time of weather aberration. The vulnerability and risk of crop production due to weather fluctuations and climate variability can be minimized if future weather variation can be adequately predicted and a suitable process-based ecophysiological crop yield forecasting model can be identified to produce real-time yield forecasts. Scientists and farmers must join efforts to further understand crop-climate relationships and formulate viable, locally adapted production technologies that will address critical issues such as climate variability.

Within temperate regions, current cultivars of determinate annual crops will mature earlier, and hence yields will decline in response to warmer temperatures. Nevertheless, this negative effect of warmer temperatures should be countered by the increased rate of crop growth at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, at least when there is sufficient water. Of more importance for the yield of annual seed crops may be changes in the frequency of hot (or cold) temperatures which are associated with warmer mean climates. The objectives of this paper are to review evidence for the importance of variability in temperature for annual crop yields, and to consider how the impacts of these events may be predicted. Evidence is presented for the importance of variability in temperature, independent of any substantial changes in mean seasonal temperature, for the yield of annual crops. Seed yields are particularly sensitive to brief episodes of hot temperatures if these coincide with critical stages of crop development. Hot temperatures at the time of flowering can reduce the potential number of seeds or grains that subsequently contribute to the crop yield. Three research needs are identified in order to provide a framework for predicting the impact of episodes of hot temperatures on the yields of annual crops: reliable seasonal weather forecasts, robust predictions of crop development, and crop simulation models which are able to quantify the effects of brief episodes of hot temperatures on seed yield.

Accurate forecasts of climate 3-6 months ahead of time can potentially allow farmers and others in agriculture to make decisions to reduce unwanted impacts or take advantage of expected favorable climate. However, potential benefits of climate forecasts vary considerably because of many physical, biological, economic, social, and political factors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential economic value of climate forecasts for farm scale management decisions in one location in the Southeast USA (Tifton, GA; 31 degrees 23'N; 83 degrees 31'W) for comparison with previously-derived results for the Pampas region of Argentina, The same crops are grown in both regions but at different times of the year. First, the expected value of tailoring crop mix to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases for a typical farm in Tifton was estimated using crop models and historical daily weather data. Secondly, the potential values for adjusting management of maize (Zea maize L.) to different types of climate forecasts (perfect knowledge of (a) ENSO phase, (b) growing season rainfall categories, and (c) daily weather) were estimated for Tifton and Pergamino, Argentina (33 degrees 55'S; 60 degrees 33'W). Predicted benefits to the farm of adjusting crop mix to ENSO phase averaged from US$ 3 to 6 ha(-1) over all years, depending on the farmer's initial wealth and aversion to risk. Values calculated for Argentina were US$ 9-15 for Pergamino and up to US$ 35 for other locations in the Pampas. Varying maize management by ENSO phase resulted in predicted forecast values of US$ 13 and 15 for Tifton and Pergamino, respectively The potential value of perfect seasonal forecasts of rainfall tercile on maize profit was higher than for ENSO-based forecasts in both regions (by 28% in Tifton and 70% in Pergamino). Perfect knowledge of daily weather over the next season provided an upper limit on expected value of about US$ 190 ha(-1) for both regions. Considering the large areas of field crop production in these regions, the estimated economic potential is very high. However, there are a number of challenges to realize these benefits. These challenges are generally related to the uncertainty of climate forecasts and to the complexities of agricultural systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Different method for aggregating simulated county and national crop yields for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Denmark were tested using a crop simulation model (CLIMCROP), which was run with and without irrigation for a range of soil types and climatic conditions. The aggregated county or national yield was calculated by summing simulated yield of each category multiplied by the area, they represent. Ten different combinations of scales of climate and soil data were used. The wheat area was distributed between the different soil types using either a uniform distribution or a distribution that gave preference to soils with high water-holding capacity. The simulated results were compared with Danish county and national yield statistics for winter wheat from the period 1971-1997. There was, in general, a poor relationship between simulated and observed yields when the observed yields had been detrended to remove the technology effect. A larger fraction of the inter-annual variability was captured by the model on the loamy soils compared with the sandy soils. The model was able to capture most of the spatial variation in observed yields, except at the coarsest resolutions of the soil data. The finest resolution of soil and climate data gave a better fit of simulated to observed spatial autocorrelation in yield. The results indicate that upscaling of simulated productivity of crops for Danish conditions requires a spatial resolution of soil data of 10 x 10 km(2) or finer. A single climate station may be sufficient if only national yields are estimated, but more stations are required, if regional yields are to be estimated. Consideration should also be given to the distribution of crop area on the different soil types, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Its natural resources spurred strategic geopolitical developments beginning in the 16th century but intense development of the boreal forest is largely limited to the 20th century. Insects cause considerable loss of wood that has an adverse effect on the balance of carbon sequestered by forests. Current understanding of processes that lead to stand-replacing outbreaks in three insect species is reviewed in this paper. Many of these processes depend on climate either directly, such as reduced survival with extreme weather events, or indirectly, mainly through effects on the host trees. In the boreal zone of Canada, pest-caused timber losses may be as much as 1.3-2.0 times the mean annual depletions due to fires. Pests are thus major, but consistently overlooked forest ecosystem components that have manifold consequences to the structure and functions of future forests. Global change will have demonstrable changes in the frequency and intensity of pest outbreaks, particularly at the margins of host ranges. The consequent shunting of carbon back to the atmosphere rather than to sequestration in forests as biomass is thought to have positive feedback to global warming. Whereas significant progress has been made in developing carbon budget models for the boreal forests of Canada, enormous problems remain in incorporating pest effects in these models. These problems have their origins in the nature of interactions among pests with forest productivity, and problems with scaling. The common problems of verification and validation of model results are particularly troublesome in projecting future forest productivity. The interaction of insects with fires must be accounted for if realistic carbon sequestration forecasts in a warming climate are to be made, These problems make assessments of mitigation and adaptation of pest management alternatives difficult to evaluate at present. Nevertheless, the impacts of stand-replacing insect population outbreaks is important in formulating future resource management policy. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

We tested whether an individual-based model could forecast the dynamics and time to extinction in aquatic microcosms of a protist predator and prey: predatory Didinium nasutum and bacterivorous Colpidium striatum. By addressing both persistence and dynamics, the model increases the testability of mechanisms of extinction. Population-level equations modeled the functional response and prey growth. For individual predators, we simulated time since dividing and feeding, and number of prey consumed; these influenced the timing of division and death. We tested the model by comparing simulated dynamics to data from three experiments.: (1) an experiment initiated with low predator-prey ratios in 30-mL bottles; (2) an experiment similar to Experiment 1, but in which immigrant predators, prey, or both were added during the first density cycle; (3) an experiment in 30-mL bottles, initiated with various predator-prey ratios. Using only nine parameters measured in independent experiments, simulations gave satisfactory predictions of the period and amplitude of cycles of predator and prey densities, and predator and prey densities through time for Experiment 1. Adding stochasticity to the model also allowed it to reproduce observed prey and predator persistence and the proportion of replicates with prey extinctions. We used the improved model to forecast the results of Experiments 2 and 3. In Experiment 2, persistence changed with immigration. The model qualitatively reproduced these changes but underestimated their magnitude. Increasing the initial predator-prey ratio reduced persistence in Experiment 3. Simulations failed to qualitatively reproduce these results for 30-mL microcosms, unless we raised initial prey density. This study demonstrates the use of an individual-based model to help identify and test mechanisms of extinction in predator-prey interactions. The combination of individual-based and population-level formalisms can maintain both model tractability and a close working relationship between models and accessible data.",,,,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",,,,,9,9,2,25,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2000,81,12,,,,,3312,3329,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[3312:PEPWAI]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000166134400006,,,,,

This species has a strong association with old-growth forests that also have economic value as timber. Research questions relevant to conservation of this species include how temporal trends in Northern Spotted Owl populations are influenced and how spatial configuration of old-growth forests affects these populations. To address these questions, we studied a population of marked Northern Spotted Owls on 95 territories in northwestern California from 1985 through 1994. We examined the magnitude of temporal and spatial variation in life history traits (survival, reproductive output, and recruitment), the effects of climate and landscape characteristics on temporal and spatial variation in these traits, respectively, and how this variation affected aspects of population dynamics. We used a components-of-variation analysis to partition sampling from process variation, and a model selection approach to estimate life history traits using capture-recapture and random-effects models. Climate explained most of the temporal Variation in life history traits. Annual survival varied the least over time, whereas recruitment rate varied the most suggesting a ""bet-hedging"" life history strategy for the owl. A forecast of annual rates of population change (lambda), estimated from life history traits, suggested that Northern Spotted Owl populations may change solely due to climate influences, even with unchanging habitat conditions. In terms of spatial variation, annual survival on territories was positively associated both with amounts of interior old-growth forest and with length of edge between those forests and other vegetation types. Reproductive output was negatively associated with interior forest, but positively associated with edge between mature and old-growth conifer forest and other vegetation types. A gradient existed in territory specific estimates of fitness derived from these life history estimates. This gradient suggested that a mosaic of older forest interspersed with other vegetation types promoted high fitness in Northern Spotted Owls. Habitat quality, as defined by fitness, appeared to buffer variation in annual survival but did not buffer reproductive output. We postulated that the magnitude of lambda was determined by habitat quality, whereas variation of lambda was influenced by recruitment and reproductive output. As habitat quality declines, variation in X-should become more pronounced.",,,,,,,,,,378,397,7,217,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

If current developments in nonlinear dynamics are to be of relevance to population ecology, however, it is necessary to determine whether chaos occurs in nature. Here we bring together two lines of evidence suggesting that the dynamics of vole populations in northern Fennoscandia may be chaotic: nonlinear analysis of time-series data, and a model based on biological mechanisms. We review how a mechanistic population model can be used to produce short-term population forecasts, even when one of the species is not observed, and then use this benchmark of model accuracy to support our choice of a mechanistic population model for vole dynamics.By adjusting model parameters to optimise the forecasting accuracy on the vole time series, we can obtain parameter estimates for the model. In tests on simulated data, this new approach to parameter estimation for stochastic dynamic models yields parameter estimates such that the fitted model produces dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed. However, some parameters are poorly identified (i.e., many different parameter combinations yield nearly identical model dynamics). For the best-fit parameters, the model dynamics are characterized by quasi-chaotic behavior; the global Lyapunov exponent is very close to (and statistically undistinguishable from) zero, but the median local Lyapunov exponent is significantly positive. Our findings of recurrent short-term chaos suggest that vole dynamics in northern Fennoscandia are characterized by a blend of order and irregularity. The irregularity is the same type as would occur in a noisy chaotic system (i.e., exogenous noise amplification by sensitive dependence on initial conditions) but only occurs during specific portions of the oscillation.",,,,"Brainerd, Scott M./A-1172-2010",,,,,,98,101,1,29,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2000,81,11,,,,,3099,3116,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[3099:LOTEOC]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000165384000013,,,,,

Biological Conservation 82, 147-155) of relative vulnerability to habitat fragmentation for 43 species of birds in the box-ironbark system of central Victoria, Australia. The predictions were based on a simple, tripartite model linking habitat specialization, density and mobility, three of the characteristics most widely mooted in the literature to influence vulnerability to habitat fragmentation. For each species, a predicted index of 'proneness' to local extinction was calculated by using prior, independent data. The model system consisted of existing fragments of 10, 20, 40 and 80 ha size-classes, with between 5 and 15 'replicates' of each size-class. Replicated 'refcrence-areas' - mapped-out areas of these same size-classes set within large (> 10 000 ha) remnant forests of the same general vegetation as the fragments - were surveyed also to. provide 'expectations' of the likelihood of finding each species in a given size-class. Our results indicated that the simple model had virtually no predictive power: the index-values for proneness to local extinction were no help in forecasting whether a given species was over- or under-represented in a fragment of a given size based on the bird's occurrence in reference-areas of similar size. When the three components of the model were tested separately, measures of habitat specialization and mobility showed no relationship with the observed responses of birds to fragmentation, while for population density there was a significant relationship but in a direction contrary to that expected. Evaluation of assumptions underlying the test revealed two main factors that are likely to have affected the model's performance: (I)differences in anthropogenic impacts between fragments and reference-areas have resulted in differences in habitat quality, and (2) species interactions within fragments differ from those in reference-areas, a result of secondary effects arising from the altered spatial pattern of the habitat (e.g. the expansion of numbers and influence of 'despotic' species such as the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala), These two factors appear to be common to most fragmented systems and, therefore, need to be addressed in predictive models of species vulnerability. However, because the nature of anthropogenic impacts and the types of changes to species interactions in fragments differ between ecosystems, we conclude that it will be difficult to develop a model of species' vulnerability to fragmentation that has both strong predictive ability and wide generality among ecosystems.

Many discrete-time, discrete-space ecological processes can be analyzed using STARMA theorems.

Examples show how this allows one to characterize general space-time population genetic processes in a new and more detailed way. STARMA processes include migration-drift models with general patterns of migration among populations. They also include processes with features that are more realistic for many natural population systems, including various forms of stochastic migration. The space-time correlations are particularly important because they allow us to connect data to theoretical processes, and they can be used for estimating migration rates, model-fitting, testing, and forecasting the future behavior of real systems. The space-time correlations also specify the relationship between spatial correlations at different spatial distances, thus bridging gaps between observations on spatial correlations and inferences about dispersal and selection, and other aspects of the underlying space-time process.

The analysis of global vegetation distributions determined by earth's climates is usually based on biogeographical classifications. These classifications assume that flora in any location is predetermined by certain parameters of climate, and that change in these parameters will produce instant changes in plants composition. Application of the models employing biogeographical classifications to different scenarios of climate change is generally limited with the hypothesis of 'dynamic equilibrium': the rate of climate change should be comparable with the rate of vegetation response. The estimated rate of hypothesized global warming is now considered to be fast enough to fall outside these limits. Therefore, an alternative assumption that the forests will be extirpated, but will not migrate to the new territory within the time limits of CO, doubling, can be considered a better approximation of future vegetation dynamics. We propose a model to study the effect of native variability of input data on model prediction, portraying vegetation migration as a stochastic process. We included into analysis only variability of climate and assumed that the only process affected by changing climate variability is vegetation mortality (i.e. regional extirpation). Our simulations show that the probabilistic approach can significantly change the forecasts of global vegetation redistribution. The predicted by the model extirpation area for boreal forests is significantly less, than the area predicted by the equilibrium model without forest in-migration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These efforts have been, however, modest in marine ecosystems. An examination of seagrass communities, which are simple assemblages with a limited membership of about 50 species worldwide and < 12 species in any one community, provides, however, strong evidence for the existence of such positive link between species richness and ecosystem functions. Ecosystem functions are, however, dependent on the particular membership of the community, rather that its number, for the functions are species-specific properties. Yet evidence, is provided, that an increasing species richness should be, on average, linked to an increase in the functional repertoire present in the community, will lead to a more efficient use of resources and a greater capacity to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem functions under disturbance or ecosystem change. Closer examination indicates that the functional variability of mixed-species seagrass assemblages is correlated to the variability in species size, whereas species of similar size tend to show similar functional capacities and, therefore, a greater degree of functional redundancy. In addition, the demonstration of positive interactions in seagrass communities, which are also dependent on the presence of engineering species in the community that facilitate the growth of other species, provides increasing grounds to expect an enhanced functional performance of mixed communities over that expected from a simple additive contribution of the community members. Multispecific communities also hold, within the functional repertoire they contain, many unrealised functional potentials that may prove instrumental to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem functions in the presence of disturbance or a changing environment. The arguments offered, illustrated for the comparatively simple seagrass communities, provide strong reasons to expect a strong - if difficult to test experimentally - positive relationship between species diversity and the functions of marine ecosystems and, thereby, the services they yield to humanity.

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) of individual time series showed that forecast accuracy declined during enrichment for taxa which showed increased variability, while forecast uncertainty increased for all fossil pigments.

There is clear evidence of decline in many populations, but the existence of other stable or expanding populations offers the possibility of a variety of creativity solutions to their conservation problems. The 1998 National Koala Conservation Strategy emphasizes the need to obtain demographic information and to use this information to assess management options for koalas. We need accurate diagnoses of the status of koala populations and forecasts of their demographic future with and without particular management actions. In a qualitative fashion, this process has been undertaken many times on a local and national scale. Quantitative demographic forecasting tools are increasingly available, and koala management could benefit from their application both at the scale of individual populations and more broadly. There is already a considerable body of suitable data on the dispersal, effects of normal and catastrophic environmental variation on reproduction and survival, and on the effects of habitat change. Demographic forecasting, however, is hampered because the full suite of informations is rarely available from a single population. In two Queensland populations, retrospective population viability analyses provided forecasts that were in agreement with observed populations trends. Work is needed to determine whether data from one population can be applied to other populations. Models can then be developed to make projections at a multipopulation level on the basis of local population dynamics and dispersal. Certain koala populations, because of their long history of study, offer the opportunity to test demographic models retrospectively. These tests will not only aid in fine-tuning the models for koala biology and data but will also assist with the more general process of validating the models.",,,,"Sherwin, William B B/C-3432-2008","Sherwin, William B B/0000-0002-1578-8473; Lunney, Dan/0000-0002-5771-0746",,,,,15,18,3,39,,,,0888-8892,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

A key step in this process is identifying which details are relevant for predicting dynamics. Currently. this remains a limiting step in development of analytical theory because experimental field ecology, which provides the key empirical insight, and theoretical ecology, which translates empirical knowledge into analytical theory, remain weakly linked. I illustrate how an individual-based computational model of species interactions is a useful way to bridge the gulf between empirical research and theory development. I built a computational model that reproduced key natural history and biological detail of an old-field interaction web composed of a predator species, a herbivore species and two plant groups that had been the subject of extensive previous field research. I examined, using simulation experiments, how individual behavior of herbivores in response to changing resource and predator abundance scaled to long-term population-level and community-level dynamics. The simulation experiments revealed that the long-term community dynamics could be highly predictable because of two counterintuitive reasons. First, seasonality was a strong forcing variable on the system that removed the possibility of serial dependence in population abundance over time. Second, because of seasonality, short-term behavioral responses of herbivores played a much stronger role in shaping community structure than longer-term processes such as density responses. So, simply knowing the short-term responses of herbivores at the evolutionary ecological level was sufficient to forecast the long-term outcome of experimental manipulations. This study shows that an individual-based model, once it is calibrated to the real-world held system, can provide key insight into the biological detail that analytical models should include to predict long-term dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,42,43,0,18,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2000,89,3,,,,,471,484,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.890306.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000087293400006,,,,,

Statistical analysis of the answers led to three main conclusions: (1) the existing botanical-ecological classification of vegetation groups used in the study was found to be suitable for the evaluation of its visual qualities; (2) levels of public preference varied and depended on the types of vegetation group; and (3) visual preference for vegetation types could be derived from the individual plants' physical properties and the latter could be used to forecast the level of public visual preference for a proposed vegetation plan. This study, therefore, suggests a workable evaluation method that could be used for identifying and evaluating public preference for vegetation groups.

Seeds of common exotic and native prairie species were sown into burned and unburned plots in late September, 1995. Emerged seedlings were censussed the following winter, early spring and late spring. Results indicated that spring population levels could not be forecast by fall seedling flushes, as winter survival was important in seedling establishment. The bulk of emergence for all grass and annual forb species occurred in the fall, followed by low to severe winter mortality. Perennial forbs were more variable in emergence times but, once emerged, perennial forb seedlings were likely to become established. Burning caused a statistically significant increase in seedling accumulation through emergence and survival in 11 of 23 cases. Burning improved seedling winter survival for most grass and short-lived forb species and increased emergence of perennial forb species. These patterns were most conspicuous on the two sites dominated by exotic species, where burning significantly improved the accumulation of seedlings from most native species tested. Thus, prescribed burning might be a useful restoration tool in these communities. In contrast, two of the three species increased by burning in the native bunchgrass site were exotic pest plants, suggesting that fire should be prescribed with caution.",,,,,,,,,,35,36,1,26,,,,1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Twice-yearly samples of different age-groups of trout were recorded, together with a more detailed set of records for a further 8 years. These data are used to develop and calibrate a time-dependent population model. A concurrent record of rainfall data for Windermere is aggregated to form seasonal averages and used as an indicator of drought for the region. Drought conditions result in lower than expected stock which can be identified as outliers from the Ricker stock-recruitment curves for each sample. A set of five difference equations, which describe the overlapping trout age-groups, is identified and used to forecast the trout population up to a few years ahead. The model is particularly successful at forecasting population numbers 1-year ahead if the following years drought is taken into account. Incorporation of drought effects into the model significantly improves model forecasts. A linearised stability analysis suggests that long-term drought conditions will have the effect of increasing population stability, although a particularly severe drought, or series of severe droughts, may lead to population decline.

In an introduction experiment we found that, independent of treatment, some study lakes remained empty of wild mallard pairs (""empty lakes""), whereas on other lakes introduced birds attracted wild mallards (""attractive lakes""). In the other experiment we used mallard ducklings to address brood-stage food limitation by studying mass change of ducklings, We found that ducklings foraging on lakes that did not attract wild mallard pairs in the introduction experiment gained much less mass than those foraging on attractive lakes. In most cases ducklings even lost mass in the empty-lake foraging trials, providing strong evidence for food limitation. Therefore. lakes that remained empty of wild mallard pairs in the introduction experiment proved to be inferior brood habitats, particularly in terms of food. Our results give insight into the mechanisms underlying the general habitat selection hypotheses, specifically the ideal preemptive and conspecific attraction rules. The results further support our earlier conclusion that mallards do not use the ideal preemptive rule when selecting nesting lakes. However, conspecific attraction may not be generally applicable either, because. independent of the presence of introduced conspecifics, wild mallards somehow anticipated the low quality of the empty lakes as brood-rearing habitats and made their habitat-selection decision accordingly.",,,,"Elmberg, Johan/H-1868-2014; Poysa, Hannu/C-2601-2014",,,,,,27,28,0,9,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2000,122,4,,,,,582,586,,,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000086455000018,28308352,,,,

The site index was calculated from soil, topographical and geological features, and slope attributes of the island, and was classified into five degrees. The orchards dominating the higher site indices seemed to have high primary productivity. Pine forests were located at lower degrees of the site index. To predict a future landscape of the island for 2088, vegetation/land use types were analyzed using a Markov chain model under two scenarios. Consequently, the kudzu community will become predominant on this island if abandoned orchards are not appropriately managed. Future landscapes of all the 18 town municipalities of Hiroshima Prefecture in the Seto Inland Sea were predicted, and then classified by agricultural statistics. As a result, a total of four distinct landscape types were forecast to form in this area by the mid-21st century. These four types were abandoned rural landscape (including Shimokamagari), reducing rural landscape, working rural landscape types and a natural landscape type. However pine forests would decline in all rural landscape types due to an ecological succession of forests.",,,,,,,,,,3,4,0,2,,,,1369-8273,,1-85312-848-1,ADV ECOL SCI,,,2000,6,,,,,,83,106,,,,,,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical",,,WOS:000167856800003,,,,,

Current increases in demand, coupled with climate change-induced uncertainty over supply, means that UK water resources are closer to sustainability limits than ever before. Demand management is increasingly viewed as a key element of a sustainable water resource strategy, but must be supported by accurate demand forecasts, preferably those that address micro-scale multi-component demands as these can provide better information on which optimal decisions about water allocation can be made. However, good demand forecasting in itself is not sufficient to promote the sustainable use of water resources. The implications of demand, and strategies to manage that demand must also be considered, notably in the equitable allocation of supplies between future and current users, between current social groups, and the needs of the environment.

We compare the process of parameter estimation for three 1/f models (white, pink and brown noise) with each other, and with autoregressive noise models (which are not 1/f noises), using data from a model time-series (length, T) of population. We then calculate the expected increase in variance and the expected extinction risk for each model, and we use these to explore the implication of assuming an incorrect noise model. When parameterising these models, it is necessary to do so in terms of the measured (""sample"") parameters rather than fundamental (""population"") parameters. This is because these models are non-stationary: their parameters need not stabilize on measurement over long periods of time and are uniquely defined only over a specified ""window"" of timescales defined by a measurement process. We find that extinction forecasts can differ greatly between models, depending on the length, T, and the coefficient of variability, CV, of the time series used to parameterise the models, and on the length of time into the future which is to be projected. For the simplest possible models, ones with population itself the 1/f noise process, it is possible to predict the extinction risk based on CV of the observed time series. Our predictions, based on explicit formulae and on simulations, indicate that (a) for very short projection times relative to T, brown and pink noise models are usually optimistic relative to equivalent white noise model; (b) for projection timescales equal to and substantially greater than T, an equivalent brown or pink noise model usually predicts a greater extinction risk, unless CV is very large; and (c) except for very small values of CV, for timescales very much greater than T, the brown and pink models present a more optimistic picture than the white noise model. In most cases, a pink noise is intermediate between white and brown models. Thus, while reddening of environmental noise may increase the long-term extinction probability for stationary processes, this is not generally true for non-stationary processes, such as pink or brown noises.

Historical perspectives increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of landscapes and provide a frame of reference for assessing modern patterns and processes. Historical records, however, are often too brief or fragmentary to be useful, or they are not obtainable for the process or structure of interest. Even where long historical time series can be assembled, selection of appropriate reference conditions may be complicated by the past influence of humans and the many potential reference conditions encompassed by nonequilibrium dynamics. These complications, however, do not lessen the value of history; rather they underscore the need for multiple, comparative histories from many locations for evaluating both cultural and natural causes of variability, as well as for characterizing the overall dynamical properties of ecosystems. Historical knowledge may not simplify the task of setting management goals and making decisions, but 20th century trends, such as increasingly severe wildfires, suggest that disregarding history can be perilous. We describe examples from our research in the southwestern United States to illustrate some of the values and limitations of applied historical ecology. Paleoecological data from packrat middens and other natural archives have been useful for defining baseline conditions of vegetation communities, determining histories and rates of species range expansions and contractions, and discriminating between natural and cultural causes of environmental change. We describe a montane grassland restoration project in northern New Mexico that was justified and guided by an historical sequence of aerial photographs showing progressive tree invasion during the 20th century. Likewise, fire scar chronologies have been widely used to justify and guide fuel reduction and natural fire reintroduction in forests. A southwestern network of fire histories illustrates the power of aggregating historical time series across spatial scales. Regional fire patterns evident in these aggregations point to the key role of interannual lags in responses of fuels and fire regimes to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (wet/dry cycles), with important implications for long-range fire hazard forecasting. These examples of applied historical ecology emphasize that detection and explanation of historical trends and variability are essential to informed management.",,,,"Allen, Craig D./K-1121-2019","Allen, Craig D./0000-0002-8777-5989",,,,,825,861,23,506,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

A sophisticated computer model, coupling a geographical information system with a stochastic discrete event simulator, has been developed to anticipate the propagation of the green alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the north-western Mediterranean sea. The simulation model provides reliable predictions, a couple of years in advance, of: (i) the local expansion patterns of the alga; (ii) the increase of C. taxifolia biomass and (iii) the covered surfaces. However because the algorithmic model accounts for spatial interactions and anthropic dispersion/activities such as eradication, introduction of specific predators etc., simulations are extremely time and memory consuming. Therefore, to reduce the computational burden, a neural network was successfully trained on artificially generated data provided by the simulation runs to provide accurate forecasts 12 years in advance along with associated confidence intervals. The ability of the neural networks to capture the underlying physics of the phenomena is clearly illustrated by several preliminary experiments on a large coastal area. The neural network is able to construct, on this site, estimates of the Caulerpa taxifolia expansion 12 years in advance in good agreement with the simulation trajectories.

However, there are few tools to monitor soil condition which can reliably inform farmers of the state of their soil. This paper examines ants and their importance in ecosystem functioning, principally their ability to maintain or restore soil quality in rural environments, and their value as bioindicators of soil quality. The reader is provided with a summary of those studies which have recorded the species composition and activity of ant fauna in agricultural soils and naturally vegetated environments. However, it is rare to find studies which sample both environments concurrently. An overview of the types of measures available to assess ant biodiversity is followed by a discussion of the current status of biopedological research into ant-soil relationships and the trends and gaps in current research knowledge, principally in the areas of water and soil movement and nutrient effects. Lastly the paper seeks to forecast the future directions of ant biopedological research, and to identify the type of research required to fully appreciate the value of ants as soil quality indicators to monitor the sustainability of the soil resource. Ants should be considered an important group of soil fauna, yet they have received meagre attention in comparison with other soil fauna such as earthworms. There is a need for specific experiments to test the hypothesis that ants can be used as bioindicators of soil quality. (C)1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using an aerial survey carried out in the winter of 1997, the impacts of this management measure on the moose population and its harvest by hunting were evaluated. Contrary to expectation, the winter moose density, estimated at 1.8 +/- 0.3 moose / 10 km(2) (alpha = 0.10), has remained unchanged since the previous survey carried out in 1991. However the structure of this population has changed. Bulls, which had represented 28.0% of the winter population in 1991 only represented 15.8% in 1997. In sharp contrast, the percentage of cows in winter increased from 41.4% to 51.8% between 1991 and 1997; this difference is significant (1-tailed Z test, P < 0.001). The percentage of bulls among adults fell from 40.3% to 23.4%, which is below the target value of 30%. Despite this imbalance in the sex ratio, the productivity of this population was excellent, with a winter ratio of 62 calves per 100 cows. Moreover, this ratio was not statistically different from that observed in 1991 (74 calves: 100 cows; P > 0.05). Productivity in the fall, prior to the hunting season, has remained stable since the introduction of selective hunting, with a ratio of 73 calves per 100 cows as compared to 68 calves per 100 cows. It was hypothesized that the better survival of cows allowed a greater number of them to achieve their full reproductive potential. The overall harvest rate seemed higher in the fall of 1996 (27%) than it was in the fall of 1990 (25%) even though the harvest of cows was cut in half This increase in the harvest rate was not due to selective hunting, but rather to a 2-day extension of the hunting season which resulted in an additional harvest of 2.6%. The harvest rate for bulls, estimated at 57.5%, was very high and exceeded the initial forecasts in the management plan, which set this rate at 35%. This situation was attributed to the fact that the quotas placed on cows have resulted in a transfer of hunting pressure, mainly towards bulls and, to a lesser extent, towards calves. Nevertheless, selective harvest has improved the recruitment of calves and the population now has a growth rate that is superior to what it was prior to 1994 (lambda = 1.053). However, sport hunting largely offsets this clear growth in the fall population. In conclusion, it is expected that the winter population of this hunting zone will increase more slow ly than forecasted in the management plan. Moreover, the effects of selective hunting will be positive provided that the firearm-hunting season continues to be after the main rutting period of moose.",,,,,,,,,,1,3,0,8,,,,0835-5851,,,ALCES-N AM MOOSE CON,,,1999,35,,,,,,191,202,,,,,,Ecology; Zoology,,,WOS:000085992700017,,,,,

Many hope that collection and monitoring of such indicators will provide important policy guidance to decision-makers and provide a means for tracking sustainable development. This project was designed with the following goals: (i) to select indicators that could be linked to an operational definition for sustainable development within the Fraser River Basin (British Columbia); (ii) to assess the accessibility, quality and relevance of the best available data for developing such indicators; (iii) to apply modeling techniques for discerning the linkages among indicators; and (iv) to provide recommendations for further indicator selection and modeling research. The major methodological conclusions reached were: (i) it is important to link sustainable development goals to movements of a small slate of individual indicators as single indicators can rarely be linked to any specific sustainable development goal; (ii) the poor quality, inaccessibility and irrelevance of existing data are pervasive constraints to reliable indicator modeling; (iii) modeling is most appropriate at aggregated spatial scales such as provinces or large watersheds, while modeling at smaller ecosystem-based spatial levels is feasible but unreliable; and (iv) linking the use of deterministic and qualitative modeling approaches is a useful means for projecting indicators and discerning important policy linkages, while conventional statistical modeling approaches are frequently inappropriate because of unreliable or non-commensurable data. This has profound implications for indicator selection and modeling. In contrast to much of the current indicator work, which relies on selecting a large number of detailed specific indicators, it would be more fruitful and less costly to focus attention on a small number of indicators within selected indicator classes (such as economic, social, environmental or human health indicators). The precise specification of the indicator within each of these classes is of less consequence. Indicator modeling work should focus on larger scale systems, as opposed to smaller ecosystem units. Such work is most suited to identifying qualitative policy trade-offs and implications, rather than to forecasting specific indicators. Data gathering efforts can be scaled down substantially and should be informed, but not unduly constrained, by available model frameworks. Greater focus is required on modeling frameworks that can use incomplete data sets or qualitative information, and linking existing quantitative model structures to external qualitative models.

The workshop in Florence was accompanied by an exhibit of some useful halophytes from different climates in which the plants were irrigated with a 1.5% NaCl solution. The salt solution was pumped by a solar powered membrane pump in order to demonstrate the possibility of applying the concept in an insular situation. The present paper serves as an introduction to the slate of papers presented at the workshop which are published in this volume. These papers are contributions to the analysis of environmental parameters and requirements important for the use and/or development of halophytes for potential utilisation. For the comparison of the climatic requirements a climate diagram CD (Lieth et al., 1999) was developed of which a prototype was also presented at the congress.",,,,,,,,,,9,13,0,3,,,,0923-0688,,90-5782-038-2,PROG BIOMET,,,1999,13,,,,,,1,17,,,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,,,WOS:000086718500001,,,,,

However direct experiments take much time, are very expensive, and therefore are practically impossible. Promising way is to use approximate estimates of reliability, which need essentially fewer amounts of experimental data. Two types of estimates of Life Support System reliability - additive and multiplicative ones are considered in the paper. Additive estimate is based on the assumption that total system failure probability is low and therefore it can be considered as the sum of failure probability of separate units. Additive approach allows obtaining near lower-bounded estimate of failure probability. Multiplicative estimate allows evaluating the possibility of system catastrophe due to simultaneous effect of several factors when each of them separately is not dangerous. Evaluation shows that the possible error of reliability forecast increases with the increasing of number of external factors faster than exponential function.

Although their measurement methods and sampling frames are very different, both programs are developing annual systems to better detect trends in land use and ecosystem health, evaluate effectiveness of public policies, guide sustainable development, and forecast alternative future conditions. Other federal programs use Landsat satellite data to map the nation's land cover, land use. and habitat diversity. I offer two proposals that could increase consistency and reduce cost among these federal monitoring programs. First, a national consortium would acquire Landsat data every two to five years for the entire USA, and rapidly detect abrupt changes in spectral reflectance associated with land clearing and major changes in land cover. This would provide spatial data to update existing maps of land cover and land use, and improve statistical monitoring. However, Landsat resolution is not sufficient to identify detailed categories of land use and forest cover; rather, higher-resolution sensors are necessary to significantly reduce the required amount of field data, Therefore, the second proposal is acquisition and interpretation of large-scale high-resolution aerial photography for hundreds of thousands of FIA and NRI sampling units. This ambitious enterprise might be feasible with collaboration between these two programs. They would integrate their separate photo-interpretation operations, and collocate 65-ha NRI sampling units with 1-ha FIA field plots. Each year, a 20% sub-sample of the collocated sampling units is photographed from low-elevation aircraft to detect rapid and obvious changes, while field data are gathered for a 10% subsample of field plots to detect slower and more subtle changes. Field data are paired with remotely sensed data, and empirical models statistically comet for measurement and classification errors in remotely sensed data. Implementation is a major enterprise that requires unprecedented partnerships among federal programs. I do not believe remote sensing will be an effective technological solution without such an enterprise. Most legislators and executive leaders are not aware of the magnitude of the logistical and institutional challenges. However, extensive coordination of remote sensing among existing federal programs could produce an efficient system to evaluate sustainability of the nation's forests and agricultural lands, and assess the health of the nation's ecosystems.",,,,"Czaplewski, Raymond/AAD-6453-2019","Czaplewski, Raymond/0000-0001-5259-5593",,,,,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,US FOR SERV RMRS-P,,,1999,,12,,,,,342,348,,,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Forestry,,,WOS:000086142400058,,,,,

With the aim of developing a model for prediction of Oscinella frit (L.) population levels, migrating adults were sampled by suction traps at two locations in Sweden for 10 and 14 years, respectively. Catches were separated into two periods: spring migration, representing the size of the overwintering generation; and summer migration, representing the total size of one or two progeny generations. 2. The temperature threshold for sustained flight of O. frit was estimated to be 14 degrees C, measured as daily maximum temperature. Current weather conditions during the migration periods had weak effects on the seasonal progress of migration. There was, however, a lagged weather effect: spring migration ceased earlier in years following a warm autumn. 3. Although the number of spring migrants could not be predicted from suction trap catches in the previous year, the number was correlated with weather factors in the previous summer. Sunshine conditions early in summer, i.e. from May to July, seemed to be most important. The long time lag between this period and migration in the following spring implies that weather affects O. frit population dynamics indirectly, possibly by influencing the amount of food resources available in the autumn. 4. The number of summer migrants was correlated with the number of spring migrants, except for three observations with very small summer catches due to extremely cold and cloudy weather in early summer. 5. The number of migrants of O. frit varied up to 100-fold among years, a fact that needs to be accounted for in damage forecasts. The number of spring migrants can be predicted fairly well from weather conditions in the previous and current year, whereas the number of summer migrants can, in most years, be predicted from spring catches in suction traps.",,,,,,,,,,12,14,0,7,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In order to devise a forecasting method for more accurate estimation of their numbers and development timing, the sex attractant was studied. Various ratios, from 10:0 to 0: 10, of the two components, (Z)-10-tetradecenyl acetate (Z10-14: Ac) and (E,Z)-4, 10-tetradecadienyl acetate (E4,Z10-14:Ac), identified from the sex pheromone gland (Jung and Boo, 1997), were tested for attractivity in terms of behavioral response (taxis, approach, and landing) against P. ringoniella males in a wind tunnel. The lure with Z10-14: Ac/E4,Z10-14:Ac in a ratio of 4:6 elicited the highest response in two (taxis and approach) measurement categories. For eliciting landing behavior, the two blends of 5:5 and 4:6 were best. The single component, Z10-14:Ac, elicited taxis;behavior, but a combination of two chemicals was needed for eliciting all three behaviors. In the field, male attraction to various lure mixtures in Pherocon SC traps was usually greater than attraction to virgin females. The best field activity was in the lure baited with a 4:6 ratio of Z10-14:Ac and E4,Z10-14:Ac. Similar results were obtained from tests conducted in a net house. This optimum ratio for attracting P. ringoniella males in Korea is different from those reported in Japan (10:3) or China (7:3 to 6:4). The isomer E10-14:Ac neither improved nor depressed the number of catches when added at up to 10% of the total mixture to lures of the two components in the 4:6 ratio. The attractivity of the lures increased with higher amounts of the pheromones, up to 10 pg in the wind-tunnel experiment and 5 mg in the apple orchard. The number of males captured was not significantly different among traps installed at 0.3, 1.5, or 2 m above the ground, or among wing, delta, or water traps.

Survival and fledging success vary from year to year partly in response to changing food availability. Mortality in 'poor food' years may potentially be reduced if adults are allowed to rear only one of their two chicks. Conservation managers have therefore deliberately reduced broods to one in some recent breeding seasons, but the merits of this policy are controversial. We investigated, by simulation modelling, the conditions under which a policy of artificial brood reduction would enhance population growth. Food supply may be difficult to predict from early-season indicators so we also considered the effect of forecasting errors. Artificial brood reduction can increase the population growth rate, even in the presence of moderate forecasting errors, given a large enough cost of breeding. However, field studies suggest that the required cost of breeding is unrealistically large and the policy is unlikely to be a useful management tool for yellow-eyed penguins.",,,,,,"New Zealand Department of Conservation [1944]; Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C09405]; University of Otago postgraduate scholarship; Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust","We thank David Fletcher and Caryn Thompson for statistical advice, and Ian Jamieson, Peter Bayliss and Phil Cowan for comments on the manuscript.

Survey data for mayfly nymph densities indicated that the population experienced exponential growth between 1991 and 1997. To predict the time to full recovery of the mayfly population, we fitted logistic models, ranging in carrying capacity from 600 to 2000 nymphs/m(2), to these survey data. Based on the fitted logistic curves, we forecast that the mayfly population in western Lake Erie would achieve full recovery between years 1998 and 2000, depending on the carrying capacity of the western basin. Additionally, we estimated the mortality rate of nymphs in western Lake Erie during 1994 and then applied an age-based matrix model to the mayfly population. The results of the matrix population modeling corroborated the exponential growth model application in that both methods yielded an estimate of the population growth rate, r, in excess of 0.8 yr(-1). This was the first evidence that mayfly populations are capable of recolonizing large aquatic ecosystems at rates comparable with those observed in much smaller lentic ecosystems.

We created a comprehensive population model to determine how density dependence (linear, nonlinear, and time-delayed) and weather affected the rate of population growth of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in an isolated woodlot. We studied this nonoutbreak, polyvoltine species using a 257-mo data set spanning 23 yr, which incorporated both detailed intra-annual and long-term dynamics, and we used this model to forecast future population size. We then evaluated whether 3-yr spans of monthly data or a 22-yr span of annual data were better able to identify the key determinants that drive population dynamics, and we identified which data type created more accurate forecasts. The 257-mo comprehensive model determined that the intra-annual cycle was caused by seasonally varying intrinsic growth rates and density dependence on a 1-2 mo scale and indicated that peak population size in one year did not affect the population in the subsequent year. Interannual variability in peak and trough density was caused by the effect of weather on monthly rate of growth with a 0-2 mo time delay, with the exception of two droughts. These droughts negatively affected the population for 9 mo; the effects were probably mediated through reduced seed crop. This model explained 81% of the variability in density. Because weather determined interannual variability in density, forecasts that did not use known weather data during the forecast period were poor. When weather data were used, forecasts were accurate within 1-3 animals (10%) of observed densities up to 8 mo in the future but were inaccurate beyond 8 mo. We found that shortterm monthly data detected more factors affecting the population and created more accurate forecasts than long-term annual data, because all factors affecting the population (except droughts) occurred on a monthly scale. The annual model did not detect any weather effects except droughts and detected annual density dependence, which represents time-delayed density dependence in polyvoltine species. We argue that this annual relationship is spurious and caused by studying this polyvoltine species on an inappropriate time scale. Our work suggests that the time scale of the analysis may affect the conclusions drawn about which types of factors determine population size and with what time lag. It also suggests that, even when population fluctuations can be explained, accurately predicting future densities may be impossible when fluctuations are driven by weather.",,,,,,,,,,68,70,3,25,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We evaluate and develop a forecasting model for land-use change in the Southern Appalachians. We extend previous efforts by (a) addressing the spatial diffusion of human populations, approximated by building density, (b) examining a long time period (40 years, which is epochal in economic terms), and (c) explicitly testing the forecasting power of the models. The resulting model, defined by linking a negative binomial regression model of building density with a legit model of land cover, was fit using spatially referenced data from four study sites in the Southern Appalachians. All fitted equations were significant, and coefficient estimates indicated that topographic features as well as location significantly shape population diffusion and land use across these landscapes. This is especially evident in the study sites that have experienced development pressure over the last 40 years. Model estimates also indicate significant spatial autocorrelation in land-use observations. Forecast performance of the models was evaluated by using a separate validation data set for each study area. Depending on the land-use classification scheme, the models correctly predicted between 68% and 89% of observed land uses. Tests based on information theory reject the hypothesis that the models have no explanatory power, and measures of entropy and information gain indicate that the estimated models explain between 47% and 66% of uncertainty regarding land-use classification. Overall, these results indicate that modeling land-cover change alone may not be useful over the long run, because changing land cover reflects the outcomes of more than one human process (for example, agricultural decline and population growth). Here, additional information was gained by addressing the spatial spread of human populations. Furthermore, coarse-scale measures of the human drivers of landscape change (for example, population growth measured at the county level) appear to be poor predictors of changes realized at finer scales. Simulations demonstrate how this type of approach might be used to target scarce resources for conservation and research efforts into ecosystem effects.",,,,,,,,,,199,212,1,52,,,,1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,NOV-DEC,1998,1,6,,,,,575,594,,10.1007/s100219900052,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000077815300008,,,,,

The results suggest a limited role for the state in influencing the pace of industrial growth, but a larger role in determining where extraction might occur. In particular, the state can exercise substantial influence over the spread of logging through the designation of indigenous, military and nature reserves as protected areas and through the decision of where to build and pave roads.

The model was fitted to the data assuming that (i) the epidemic commenced when the first migrating aphid was recorded, (ii) the rate of primary infection was dependent on the total number of aphids migrating up to the end of June, and (iii) the rate of secondary infection was dependent on the proportion of diseased plants in the crop. 4, A good description of virus yellows incidence in August depended on allowing the rate parameters for primary and secondary infection to decrease sigmoidally over the years during 1965-96. The shape of this function depicted a major change in the epidemiology of virus yellows since 1974-76. Amongst several contributory factors, this change coincided with the introduction and subsequent wide use of systemic granular pesticides. 5, Good fits also depended on allowing the rates of disease progress to decay with time to accommodate effects of increasing host resistance with plant age to feeding aphids. This meant that early epidemics rose faster than late epidemics, which is consistent with general observations. 6, Given that the changes in the epidemiology of virus yellows over the years are associated with improvements in pest management practices, the model presents a useful extension to disease forecasting by providing predictions of disease risk in the absence of pesticides. Such predictions indicate that during the last decade up to five severe epidemics would have been likely.",,,,,,,,,,27,28,0,9,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J. Appl.

DLMs use an adaptive fitting procedure to track trends in the rate of decline over time, in contrast to other approaches that fit fixed parameters. We used this method to make forecasts of PCB concentrations in these fishes, along with Bayesian credible-interval estimates associated with these forecasts.

These models incorporate reliable information on population structure and underlying dynamic mechanisms but use nonparametric surface-fitting methods to avoid unsupported assumptions about the precise form of rate equations. Using historical data on measles epidemics as a case study, we show how this approach can lead to better forecasts, better characterizations of the dynamics, and a better understanding of the factors causing complex population dynamics relative to either mechanistic models or purely descriptive statistical time-series models. The semimechanistic models are found to have better forecasting accuracy than either of the model types used in previous analyses when tested on data not used to fit the models. The dynamics are characterized as being both nonlinear and noisy, and the global dynamics are clustered very tightly near the border of stability (dominant Lyapunov exponent lambda approximate to 0). However, locally in state space the dynamics oscillate between strong short-term stability and strong short-term chaos (i.e., between negative and positive local Lyapunov exponents). There is statistically significant evidence for short-term chaos in all data sets examined. Thus the nonlinearity in these systems is characterized by the variance over state space in local measures of chaos versus stability rather than a single summary measure of the overall dynamics as either chaotic or nonchaotic.",,,,,,Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust,,,,95,98,0,13,,,,0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The strong environmental gradient sampled, entirely within Peru's Manu National Park and Biosphere Reserve, supports highly diverse faunas. Elevational distributions of 901 bird species, 129 bat species, and twenty-eight species of native mice exhibit contrasting patterns in species richness, species composition, and species turnover. Birds and bats showed smooth declines of species richness with elevation, whereas the richness of mouse assemblages was unrelated to elevation. For all three groups, the greatest differences were between lowland and highland faunas, although cutoff points for this contrast varied among groups (approximate to 500 m for birds, 750 m for bats, and 1000 m for mice). Differences in composition also separated bird and bat faunas on either side of c. 1400 m (the boundary between montane forest and cloud forest); for mice, this faunal transition may take place nearer to 2000m. Bird and bat Faunas lacked the more discrete zonations suggested for mouse assemblages, as indicated by elevational range profiles and nested subset analyses. Distinct highland assemblages are apparent in two-dimensional histograms of range limits of birds and mice, but not for bats. Highland bat species occupy broader elevational ranges than lowland bat species, but for both birds and mice, species at intermediate elevations had the broadest amplitudes. Finally, clumping of range maxima and minima along the gradient identified zones of pronounced species turnover in each group, but these were generally not strongly associated with the locations of ecotones. Differences in zonation of these groups appear to reflect their different biological attributes and phylogenetic histories. Such differences obviously complicate discussions of 'general' diversity patterns, and limit the usefulness of birds to forecast or predict diversity patterns in other more poorly known groups-other groups may show elevated diversity and endemism in areas where avian diversity patterns appear unremarkable. The pronounced contrasts between bats and mice, and the generally intermediate character of avian patterns, suggest that future analyses might profitably partition birds into finer, more homogeneous groups of historically and/or ecologically similar species. Group differences in zonation may ultimately prove explicable with information on both species-abundance patterns and resource distributions.",,,,"Patterson, Bruce D/O-5068-2019; Pacheco, Victor R./F-5882-2011","Patterson, Bruce D/0000-0002-2249-7260; Pacheco, Victor R./0000-0002-1005-135X; Solari, Sergio/0000-0002-7002-2200",,,,,148,163,2,70,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

It consists of four replicate blocks, each with rows of trees separating alleys of arable crops; all four blocks have their own arable control areas in adjacent fields. 3, Pitfall trap catches within the experiment indicate that the slug population increased over the period 1991-94. The increase was greatest, and most consistent, within the tree rows in the agroforestry blocks. The increase was slower and less consistent in the arable controls and the arable areas within the agroforestry blocks. 4, In spring 1994, the slugs in each of the treatments in the agroforestry experimental area were sampled using pipe traps, refuge traps and pitfall traps. The number and diversity of slugs were highest in the grassed understorey beneath the rows of trees and significantly higher in the alleys between the rows of trees than in the arable control areas. 5, The levels of slug damage to a pea crop were assessed by surveys that recorded the number of emerging plants and the number of damaged leaves per plant. There were significant correlations between the number of slugs caught and the damage to the crop by slugs, It is concluded that slugs have the potential to be important pests of some crops in silvoarable agroforestry landscapes and that this could influence the choice of crops for this type of farming. 6.

Our aim was to quantify the effects of a warmer winter climate on the egg mortality (and, consequently, the risk of an outbreak) of Epirrita autumnata, a serious defoliator of mountain birch. 2, The egg survival of E. autumnata was studied in northernmost Finland from 1993 to 1996, when minimum temperatures were also recorded. Utilizing a digital elevation map with a GIS (Geographical Information System), models were developed for egg survival and minimum temperature, taking into account altitude, local topography and temperatures at a meteorological station-in the study area. 3. Areas of high egg mortality of E. autumnata can be modelled in the GIS with reasonable accuracy by the model describing areal distribution of minimum winter temperatures, taking account of the fact that the critical limit for egg survival of E. autumnata in midwinter is about -35.5 degrees C. The approach can be applied in short-term forecasting of outbreak areas when previous year population densities and minimum winter temperatures at meteorological stations are known. 4. In our study area, from 1961 to 1991 more than one-third of the years were egg-killing winters in the mixed birch-pine forests zone, and 15% of years in the birch forest zone. In order for an outbreak to take place, at least three consecutive seasons with a high population growth rate are needed; in the mixed birch-pine forests the possibilities of an E. autumnata outbreak during the period 1961-91 were very rare, while in the birch forest zone outbreak possibilities were also noticeably restricted by winter minimum temperatures. 5, If winter warming takes place according to the scenarios presented, by the middle of the next century the birch-growing areas in our study area protected by low temperatures from outbreaks of E. autumnata will be only one-third as great as those of today, and by the end of the next century only one-tenth of those of today. 6.

We applied methods of regression statistics, variance component estimation and a Geographical Information System (GIS) to construct indices describing crops and soils and to establish functional relationships among these variables. This paper describes the development of indices and the partitioning of the spatial and temporal variation in groundwater models using the data from Tulare County, California, which was selected as the study area. Indices of ground surface elevation, total crop water demand, soil water infiltration rate, and soil production index explain 91% of the variation in average spring groundwater level. After relating spatial patterns of groundwater use to indices of crop and soil properties, we found that mean groundwater use is positively related to total crop water demand and soil water infiltration rate while the variation in groundwater use was negatively correlated with the crop water demand and soil water infiltration rate and positively related to soil water holding capacity. The spatial variation in groundwater use was largely influenced by crops and soil types while the temporal variation was not. We also found that groundwater use increased exponentially with decreasing annual precipitation for most townships. Based on these associations, groundwater use in each township can be forecast from relative precipitation under current methods of agricultural production. Although groundwater table depth is strongly affected by topography, the statistically significant indices observed in the model clearly show that agricultural land use influences groundwater table depth. These simple relationships can be used by agronomists to make water management decisions and to design alternative cropping systems to sustain agricultural production during periods of surface water shortages.",,,,,,,,,,13,14,0,12,,,,0921-2973,,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

The networks of backpropagation type were trained on 7 years of weekly data for eight variables, and their ability to provide a 4-week forecast was evaluated for a 28-week period. They were relatively successful in providing a good forecast of both the incidence and magnitude of a growth peak of the cyanobacteria within the limits required for water quality monitoring. The use of lagged versus unlagged inputs was evaluated in the implementation and performance of the networks. Lagged inputs proved far superior in providing a fit to the actual data. Sensitivity analysis of input variables was performed to evaluate their relative significance in determining the forecast values. The analysis indicated that for this data set for the River Murray, flow and temperature were the predominant variables in determining the onset and duration of cyanobacterial growth. Water colour was the next most important variable in determining the magnitude of the population growth peak.

Wind erosion events in Australia are variable in spatial extent and intermittent in time, and they are often associated with mesoscale frontal systems, under dry weather conditions. During erosion, fine soil particles rich in nutrients and organic matter can be carried away by wind over large distances, leading to irreversible soil degradation. In the context of environmental management, the major tasks of wind erosion research are to quantify wind erosion risks on different scales of time and space, and to identify causative factors, so that strategic planning can be carried out and guidelines for wind erosion prevention measures established. It is also important to provide wind erosion forecasts for short term agricultural activities. In this paper, we describe an integrated system for wind erosion assessment and prediction. This system comprises a physically based wind erosion scheme driven by forcing data from a high resolution atmospheric model and land surface parameters from detailed Geographic Information System databases. The wind erosion scheme considers the capacity of wind to entrain and transport aeolian particles and the ability of the surface to resist wind erosion through consideration of the effects of factors such as particle size, frontal area index, top soil moisture and surface crusting. The system has been applied to an investigation, with continental coverage, of wind erosion events in Australia.

Louisiana leads the nation in rate of coastal land loss, with some 70% of national losses. Both natural and anthropogenic factors are involved in coastal land loss in Louisiana: subsidence, erosion, sediment and freshwater deficits, channelization, and rising mean sea level. Disruption of the natural deltaic cycles of the Mississippi River has been particularly detrimental to estuarine fish habitat. Navigation and flood control needs have resulted in the near-total leveeing of the river, preventing normal overbank flooding, channel filling and switching, delta and subdelta development, and sediment nourishment of adjacent and down-current marshes. The resulting system is one in which the quantity and quality of estuarine habitat are linked to rapidly degrading wetland environments. Although the relative production value of subsiding marsh surfaces is often very high, this condition is not sustainable. Steep declines in fish production have been forecast for the next century. Federal, state, and local coastal restoration projects are attempting to address the loss of estuarine habitat with a number of techniques that may produce localized changes in fisheries production and distributions. Temporary resource displacements can result in increased harvest costs, and basin-scale changes may be particularly hard to accept for resource users who are satisfied with current conditions. Harvesters have demonstrated reluctance, and may lack the financial flexibility, to forfeit expected current catches for predicted enhancement of long-term fisheries production. In some instances, both sportfishers and commercial resource users have expressed concern over estuarine freshening and turbidity from restoration inputs from riverine sources. Additional public perception difficulties with restoration efforts arise from misunderstandings of the nature of estuarine functions, particularly of the importance of nursery habitat and of the value of low-salinity marshes as nursery habitat. Significant improvement in the outlook for estuarine fish habitat in Louisiana will require long-term and large-area vision from resource managers and the public.",,,,,,,,,,5,5,0,10,,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-12-3,AM FISH S S,Am.

This and the pressure from consumers for forest products to be produced in a way which protects biodiversity has changed forestry towards a more nature oriented management. An estimation of the effects of this nature conservation on timber yields and potential cut must be included in forest scenario modelling to assess the long-term impacts. An important component of preserving biodiversity in forests in this nature oriented management is to adjust management measures in edge zones adjacent to mires, riparian zones, non-productive hills, etc. Examples of management measures in edge zones are no cutting, modified thinning, single tree selection or leaving behind large trees. These spatial considerations can now be dealt with in long-term forecasts using HUGIN, a system based on sample plot data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). This is because of the improved description of the context of the NFI sample plots in the landscape. Furthermore, geographical positions are determined using the Global Positioning System (GPS), which facilitates the combination of NFI data with other data sources. A schedule of how to select sample plots located in forest habitats that are valuable for biodiversity is shown. Analyses of the new NFI data show that approximately ii % of the productive forest land is located within 25 meters of mires and non-productive hills and 3 % is located in riparian zones.

From 1973 to 1996, we live-trapped P. leucopus monthly in a 2-ha Ohio woodlot. Population peaks (July to August) varied from 27 to 181 individuals, while troughs (December to March) varied from 4 to 46 individuals. We used time-delayed densities to act as surrogates for unobserved density-dependent factors, and principal components to represent 12 highly collinear weather variables. We identified time-delayed correlations by season between R-t and the independent variables (i.e., previous densities and weather principal components) using transfer function analysis. In summer, when P. leucopus densities were above the seasonal mean for the month, R-t was lower in the following 2 months; however, in winter, R-t was greater in the first but lower in the second succeeding month. R-t also correlated positively in autumn with contemporaneous precipitation, and was negatively correlated with 'extreme' weather in summer with 2- and 3-month lags and in winter with a 3-month lag. We hypothesize that precipitation affected juveniles by influencing food resources and that 'extreme' weather affected breeding. Our model explained 65% of the variability in R-t, and density-dependent and density-independent factors explained an equal percentage of that variability.

However, finding a population model which produces predictions accurate enough to be used for management purposes is often precluded due to scarcity and noisiness of population data. Using two long-term population data sets, 1964-1984 data on Finnish grouse (Tetrao urogallus, T. tetrix and Bonasa bonasia) and 1914-1950 data on coloured fox Vulpes fulva from Canada, we demonstrate the use and power of an artificial neural network in predicting population fluctuations. The performance of an artificial neural network model is compared to two benchmark forecasts: time series mean and the previous data value. Unfortunate as it is, in practise management decisions often have to be made with limited data. Therefore, a notable advantage of neural network modelling is the forecast accuracy even in cases when the time series available are short and noisy, and the processes underlying population fluctuations are not fully understood.",,,,,"Lindstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5630-6680",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland; Oskar Oflund Foundation,"this study. was funded by the Academy of Finland and Oskar Oflund Foundation.

For resource managers to have a sound basis for making decisions, and for conservation biology to mature as a discipline, we must go beyond case-by-case interpretation and be able to predict with confidence the impacts of fragmentation in a range ofenvironments. The reliable forecasting, for example, of those species that will be most vulnerable to fragmentation in a given environment would facilitate a pro-active approach to the management of habitats at the landscape and regional scale. There is a need for workers to formulate hypotheses that generate testable predictions, which in turn are evaluated and further refined by empirical studies. Such hypothesis testing will be most convincing when specific predictions are made prior to the conduct of a study. The purpose of the current paper is to make just such a priori predictions on the vulnerability of woodland birds to local extinction in the fragmented box-ironbark Eucalyptus microcarpa/E, tricarpa forest region of central Victoria, Australia. The present a simple model based on three characteristics of terrestrial species: mobility, population density and habitat specificity.

The climate change experiment (CLIMEX) has exposed an entire catchment of boreal vegetation to elevated CO2 (560 ppmv) and temperature (+3 degrees C in summer, +5 degrees C in winter) for the past three years and has a considerable archive of pre-and posttreatment measurements of both CO2 and water vapour fluxes of the vegetation, catchment runoff and soil nutrient status. These data have been used to test the predictions of the University of Sheffield dynamic global vegetation model (SDGVM) for the same site using historical records of climate as input. Comparisons of observations and predictions at the scale of individual leaves and whole ecosystems are generally favourable, increasing our confidence in the application of the model to forecasting the responses of the terrestrial biosphere to various global change scenarios. The SDGVM has been used to predict the future responses of the ecosystem at the site into the year 2003AD.

It allows the inclusion of several - both causal and empirical - models in a Bayesian belief network that is capable of real-time updating of uncertainties in the system. The approach can be used for diagnosis and forecasting purposes. It is illustrated with the assessment problem of the threatened, wild salmon stocks in the Baltic Sea. As usual, the institutions responsible for the management are prone to accept well-known standard assessment models. In this case, the Virtual Population Analysis approach and a set of regression models have been used. A debate on possible superiority of one or more of these models over the others is met at each annual international negotiation among stock assessment experts. The need has arisen to develop a methodology that would allow analytic fusion of these models to learn from the properties of the models and from the problem setting in general, as well as to facilitate probabilistic predictions that would utilize as much of the available information as possible. Moreover, the probabilistic approach is very compatible with and supportive to the use of the precautionary principle (risk-averse attitude).

Better knowledge on the part of such managers in relation to the complexities of the environmental management of their crops may allow them to maintain gross margins at reduced levels of inputs and yields. Such changes, whilst maintaining farm incomes, may reduce the demand for inputs, including labour. Research results tend to be location-specific so, with highly variable ecologies across regions, it is very difficult to forecast the regional economic impacts of the adoption of sustainable systems.

The first operational LRF for seasonal monsoon rainfall over the country as a whole was issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on 4 June 1886. In India, the correlation method was introduced in the first decade of this century, as an objective LRF technique. Subsequently, several forecast techniques were developed for improving the accuracy of the forecast. Presently, four LRF models, namely Parametric, Power Regression, Multiple Regression and Dynamic Stochastic Transfer are being used to issue a rainfall forecast over the whole country. The first three models use correlation as the basis while the fourth assumes that the atmosphere is a dynamic system which transfers various inputs into output such as rainfall. These models generally use different combinations of 16 land-ocean-atmospheric parameters (predictors) which appear to have physical links with the evolution of subsequent monsoon over India. For India as a whole, the monsoon rainfall forecast is issued in two stages. In the first stage, a preliminary forecast is issued in qualitative form towards the end of March or early April. In the second stage, the final forecast is issued in quantitative form towards the end of May. In this paper, LRF models which are used for issuing the final monsoon rainfall forecast are discussed in detail. For the first time, stability of the monsoon relationship with different parameters is analysed. It shows that in order to overcome epochal fluctuations in the relationship, the forecast model should be revised every year. An attempt is also made to analyse the influence of individual parameters on model forecast. Final quantitative forecasts, based on these models, have all proved to be accurate during the past successive 4 years (1989-1992). An attempt is also made to develop a few LRF models that can be used for issuing a preliminary monsoon rainfall forecast, in qualitative form, at least 2 months ahead of the final forecast. For this purpose, eight parameters out of the 16 which are available by the end of March have been utilised for developing preliminary Parametric, Power Regression, Multiple Regression and Dynamic Stochastic Transfer models. Results obtained from all the four preliminary models are analysed. Recognising the limitations of statistical models for producing very early monsoon forecast, it has been found appropriate that the preliminary monsoon forecasts are issued to users in qualitative form and not in quantitative form. While formulating a qualitative forecast, inferences obtained from different models are given due weightage. Preliminary forecasts issued based on these models have proved accurate during the past 5 successive years (1988-1992) and have become popular among different kinds of users.

The functions, estimated from re-measured plots in Wisconsin maple-birch forests, showed that basal area affected mostly the growth of small trees. However, even when the effects were statistically significant, they were small. Fifteen-year forecasts with the variable-parameter model were almost identical to those of the fixed-parameter model for a set of 37 random plots. Long-term, steady-state predictions gave similar diameter distributions for both models, but a 20% lower basal area for the variable-parameter model. Steady-state management regimes that maximized soil rent were identical for both models in terms of intensity of harvest and length of cutting cycle. The basal area, harvests, and net present values predicted by both models, in the long run and during conversion, were also nearly the same. For managed maple-birch forests, the matrix model with constant parameters has the advantage of simplicity of form, estimation, and application, especially in optimization mode.

The AIS is based on two different scales: one is a farm called 'Klostergut Scheyern' (149 ha), designed as a monitoring network with a cell resolution of 50m x 50m, the other is the surrounding area, a landscape of 547 km(2). The paper describes the spatial input data as well as the model structure of the two different scales. Finally, first results for calculating the soil water budget on the farm level, and nitrate leaching on the landscape level will be presented.",,,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,,,,0169-2046,,,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

The simulator is designed to forecast the development of both pure even-aged and mixed-species uneven-aged stands in Austria using distance-independent individual tree methodology. The primary model is for the basal area increment (BAI), which is predicted from size (diameter, crown ratio), competition (basal area of larger trees, crown competition factor), and site descriptors. Because the model must be able to simulate the development of both uneven- and even-aged stands, site index and age are intentionally not used as predictors. Available for testing is an independent data set of 22 permanent plots in mixed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)-Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands in the Austrian part of the Bohemian Massif, northeastern Austria. The validation plots were remeasured for three 5-year periods between 1977 and 1992. The prediction interval (95% confidence) for the basal area increment over the full 15-year period was 62-157%, with a mean of 99% of the observed increment. A plot-specific adjustment of the model's intercept using past increment did not improve predictions for Norway spruce, but did improve predictions for Scots pine. Thus, important site-specific variation not captured by the Scots pine model can nevertheless be accounted for by using increment calibration. A time trend towards increasing underestimation of the increment was detected in the later grown th periods of the validation data. This trend agrees with a frequently reported increase in the site potential of central European stands, possibly caused by changing weather conditions, nitrogen deposition, and abandoning of litter raking. For future model development, as many growth periods as possible should be used to parameterize increment models, although even this cannot account for a long term change in the site potential.

The design placed Lythrum and Typha in a modified replacement series experiment having four starting densities (64, 36, 16, and 1 plant(s) per quadrat) and Four relative proportions of each species (i.e., 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1, [for densities 64, 36 and 16 only]). Results of a repeated measures ANOVA indicate that overall rate of ramet production (ORP) differed significantly between species, between density treatments and between years. We also found evidence of significant intra-specific competition in both species. In the first year of the experiment, ORP in Typha was greater than that in Lythrum. However, from the second year onward, this situation was reversed and ORP in Typha was much lower than that in Lythrum. Analysis of covariance indicates a significant effect of species proportion on ORP, suggesting that both intra-, and inter-specific competition were occurring. Log-transformed ratios of input/output (i.e. proportions of Lythrum/Typha established at the beginning of the experiment, divided by the proportions found at the end of each growing season) demonstrated that in the first year Typha gained advantage in the mixtures, while by the second and third years the output ratio line crossed the 45 degrees threshold, suggesting the two species could coexist. However, by the fourth year, the output ratio line was entirely above the 45 degrees line, suggesting an overall advantage to Lythrum in the mixtures. The experiment clearly demonstrates temporal development in competitive behaviour, and suggests that Lythrum may take at least four years before becoming competitively dominant in a wetland community. The results also suggest that short-term experiments should be interpreted with care, if they are to be used to forecast the long-term outcome of competition in nature.",,,,,,,,,,49,51,0,12,,,,0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1997,79,1,,,,,26,33,,10.2307/3546086,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:A1997WY14800003,,,,,

However, if a uniquely selected model is used for prediction, the disregard of the uncertainty in model structure can lead to an underestimation of the uncertainty in model forecasts. This is particularly the case when processes become important during the prediction period that were insignificant during the identification period. If some knowledge of such processes is available, they should be included in the analysis. This requires an identification and forecasting technique that can use prior knowledge and can handle overparameterized, non-identifiable models. The Bayesian approach to statistical inference is such a technique. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of both the classical and the Bayesian methodology are discussed, and it is argued that from a methodical point of view, for poorly identifiable systems typical in ecological modelling, the Bayesian technique is the superior approach. Because of the huge computational requirements of the Bayesian technique a recommendation is given for an improved identification and forecasting procedure that, depending on the identifiability of the investigated system and on the power of the available computational facilities, uses the advantages of the appropriate method.

Interest has heightened during the past five years owing to the demonstration of loss of stratospheric ozone through human activities. We have only begun to document gross, qualitative effects of UVR on coral reef organisms, usually in experiments comparing the biological response to the presence or absence of UVR through the use of UV-cutoff filters, or to varying levels of UVR in transplantation studies. Most such studies have not distinguished between the effects of UVA (320-400 nm) and those of UVB (290-320 nm), although in the context of global change involving stratospheric ozone loss, it is the latter wavelengths that are relevant. To date we have been addressing physiological and ecological questions, not yet attempting to evaluate quantitatively the impact of forecast increases in solar UVB penetration. Interacting and synergistic effects of UVR with increased temperature, pollutants, sedimentation, visible light, etc. have scarcely been studied but will be essential to understanding and predicting the fate of coral reefs under conditions of global change. Here we comprehensively review the effects of UVR on corals and other reef macroorganisms, mindful that although much is known of proximal effects, little of this knowledge is directly useful in making long-term predictions regarding the health of coral reefs. We conclude that even small anthropogenic increases in UVB levels will have sublethal physiological manifestations in corals and other reef organisms, but that this will have relatively small impact on the distribution of reef corals and coral reefs, perhaps affecting their minimum depths of occurrence.",,,,,,,,,,182,185,4,44,,,,1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

These predictions must rake account of the impacts upon migration of human land-use and habitat fragmentation. We have developed a spatially-explicit mechanistic model (MIGRATE) able to simulate the migration of a single species across a realistically heterogeneous landscape. MIGRATE uses biological parameters that readily may be estimated from data in the literature or from field studies, and represents the landscape as a grid of cells, each with an associated carrying capacity. A one-dimensional version of MIGRATE has been compared both with Skellam's (1951) diffusion model and with the more recent analytical models of van den Bosch et al. (1990, 1992); despite its fundamentally different approach, MIGRATE provides comparable estimates of migration rates, given equivalent input parameters. An example is described that demonstrates the ability of the two-dimensional version of MIGRATE to simulate the likely pattern of spread of a species across a heterogeneous landscape. It is argued that MIGRATE, or models like it, will play a central role in a spatially-hierarchic modelling strategy that must be developed if we are to achieve the goal of simulating the likely response of trees, and other organisms, to both global climate change and the increasing pressures of human land-use.",,,,,,,,,,54,57,0,14,,,,1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Nutrient concentrations (particularly N and P) determine the extent to which water bodies are or may become entrophic. Direct determination of nutrient content on a wide scale is labour intensive but the main sources of N and P are well known. This paper describes and tests an export coefficient model for prediction of total N and total P from: (i) land use, stock headage and human population; (ii) the export rates of N and P from these sources; and (iii) the river discharge. Such a model might be used to forecast the effects of changes in land use in the future and to hindcast past water quality to establish comparative or baseline states for the monitoring of change. 2. The model has been calibrated against observed data for 1988 and validated against sets of observed data for a sequence of earlier years in ten British catchments varying from uplands through rolling, fertile lowlands to the flat topography of East Anglia. 3. The model predicted total N and total P concentrations with high precision (> 95% of the variance in observed data explained). It has been used in two forms: the first on a specific catchment basis; the second for a larger natural region which contains the catchment with the assumption that all catchments within that region will be similar. Both models gave similar results with little loss of precision in the latter case. This implies that it will be possible to describe the overall pattern of nutrient export in the UK with only a fraction of the effort needed to carry out the calculations for each individual water body. 4. Comparison between land use, stock headage, population numbers and nutrient export for the ten catchments in the pre-war year of 1931, and for 1970 and 1988 show that there has been a substantial loss of rough grazing to fertilized temporary and permanent grasslands, an increase in the hectarage devoted to arable, consistent increases in the stocking of cattle and sheep and a marked movement of humans to these rural catchments. 5. All of these trends have increased the flows of nutrients with more than a doubling of both total N and total P loads during the period. On average in these rural catchments, stock wastes have been the greatest contributors to both N and P exports, with cultivation The next most important source of N and people of P. Ratios of N to P were high in 1931 and remain little changed so that, in these catchments, phosphorus continues to be the nutrient most likely to control algal crops in standing waters supplied by the rivers studied.",,,,"Johnes, Penny J/D-1381-2009","Johnes, Penny J/0000-0003-1605-6896",,,,,141,141,1,51,,,,0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

It regularly migrates in summer to Canadian inshore waters following spawning squid. Drive fisheries from 1947 to 1971 seriously depleted numbers of Globicephala melas off Newfoundland. Mass strandings represent a major known source of natural mortality for this species. The effects of incidental entrapments, pollutants, and fisheries for prey species remain relatively unknown, but these factors have the potential for limiting this species. Globicephala melas has recently been used in satellite tracking and DNA fingerprinting studies, and is a common subject in the study of mass strandings. There are few reliable recent population estimates for Globicephala melas, but even optimistic recovery forecasts based on drive fisheries in Newfoundland would produce a present population substantially lower than pre-whaling numbers. Given that there are no immediate threats to the population a COSEWIC status designation would not seem to be warranted at this time.",,,,,,,,,,5,5,1,9,,,,0008-3550,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

The model predicts that three of 14 boreal mammals will go extinct regionally and that four of 19 mountain ranges will lose upwards of 50% of their present faunas. Here, we re-examine the model on the basis of its underlying assumptions, on the statistical and biogeographic protocols used, and on its predictive power. A key assumption, that populations of these small mammals are isolated by absolute barriers to dispersal, is challenged by published field observations and by extensive trapping records. Statistical procedures used to construct the model are questionable and the model itself yields imprecise estimates. The biogeographic principle used to identify extinction-prone species, nested subsets of species, makes predictions that are at odds with available autecological information. The demonstration of a nested pattern of species occurrences does not provide definitive evidence in resolving SLOSS - or whether a single large island or several small islands of equivalent total area will contain more species. We conclude that the model is not a reliable method for forecasting species extinctions following global warming.

The core of its solution -modelling and long-term forecast of global terrestrial vegetation changes -is considered in this paper. There are a few approaches To modelling long-term vegetation dynamics; their principles are discussed in brief. A model approach based on bioclimatic schemes has been chosen for further considerations. A model based on Holdridge's bioclimatic scheme was designed for simulation of time-dependent biome shifts. A procedure of time delays was designed to take into account inertia of vegetation response to climate change. It was based on expert estimates of biome replacements. Computer experiments have been designed to investigate the consequences of time-dependent climate changes for the vegetation of Russia. The results showed the importance of the temporal factor for long-term forecasts.

The migration model was implemented using the object-oriented class library of the generic model GenSIM. The flexibility of the migration model was maximised by specifying simple, standard interfaces for its submodels, enabling the ready substitution of one submodel for another. Since this paper was presented, the role of GenSIM has shifted away from providing a shell for the development of aggregate models. It now focuses on the less ambitious task of implementing models which fit well into such aggregate models.

Land use ranges from viticulture and dairying to extensive grazing and forestry. Soil acidity may become a problem if the soil pH is reduced to critical levels by acid accumulated when nutrient cycles are open (especially N, C and S). This study uses a model to forecast pH changes due to acids derived from land use. Soil samples from a survey in the Hunter Valley were analysed for pH (1:5 soil:0.01 M CaCl2), effective cation exchange capacity (cmol(+)/kg) and pH buffer capacity (pHBC, kmol(+) ha(-1) 0.1 m(-1) pH(-1)). Data from three contrasting soil profiles were used in SPAM (Soil Profile Acidification Model) to forecast soil pH after 25 and 50 years. Results indicate the pH of a soil under native forest is stable. Only small amounts of acid are generated by this land use and the pH is buffered by both cation exchange reactions and aluminium dissolution. However, the acid generated from an intensive pastoral system (2.5 kmol(+) ha(-1) year(-1)) is sufficient to strongly acidify a well-buffered soil (pHBC 0-10 cm = 38 kmol(+) ha(-1) 0.1 m(-1) pH(-1)) to 50 cm depth. A less intensive pastoral system (0.33 kmol(+) ha(-1) year(-1)) was estimated to acidify a soil with below average buffer capacity (pHBC 0-10 cm = 9 kmol(+) ha(-1) 0.1 m(-1) pH(-1)) to 50 cm depth in 50 years.

We studied the response of lactating red squirrels to reproductive demands that were experimentally increased by litter-size manipulations. 2. Females with experimentally increased reproductive demands ('augment' females) gained significantly more body mass during the first half of lactation than did unmanipulated ('control') females. However, augment females lost more mass following the mid-point of lactation than control females, so that the net mass difference between early lactation and late summer was negligible for both treatments. 3. Measurements of total body water at the mid-point of lactation confirmed that mass gains during early lactation reflected changes in body fat levels, indicating that females adjusted their energy stores according to their reproductive demands. 4. We also analysed the relationship between early lactation mass gain and natural litter size among a larger group of control females, studied at the same site between 1990 and 1994. There was a significant, positive relationship between natural litter size and female mass gain. Furthermore, females characterized by the largest gains in body mass had the highest levels of juvenile survival to emergence, indicating that early lactation mass gain is an important component of parental investment. 5. These responses suggest that (i) energy storage during early lactation is used to reduce daily energy requirements during late lactation; (ii) breeders use demands during early lactation to 'forecast' requirements during late lactation; and (iii) that despite the elevated energetic demands of lactation, individuals can quickly adjust their energy budgets from slightly positive to highly positive levels.",,,,"Boutin, Stan/A-2619-2014","Boutin, Stan/0000-0001-6317-038X",,,,,39,41,0,3,,,,0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The purpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine-scale and short-term interactions among individual trees to large-scale and long-term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical estimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure that parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field. This paper documents eight aspects of a three-year study to calibrate, test, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant tree species in transition oak-northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design and structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts by predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life. Species-specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment, growth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions, and individual performance is affected by the local availability of resources. Competition is mechanistic; resources available to each tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed to include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here includes only competition for light (shading and light-dependent performance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition for nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates of the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal a variety of ''strategic trade-offs'' among the species. For example, species that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively little shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high dispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light tend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship under low light and low dispersal. These trade-offs define one of two dominant ''axes'' of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions of the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance by species such as Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance by Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canndensis, with Betula alleganiensis present as a gap phase species in old-growth stands. The model also predicts that old-growth communities will have intraspecifically clumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4) An error analysis that identifies community level predictions that are robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study. This analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with each parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's predictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect (3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions and to changes in the three parameters not included in the error analysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances continue to affect community composition well into succession (>300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system- and community-level predictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other studies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in the error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect (3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of individual performance and inter-neighbor competition are responsible for each of the: robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above and tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety of causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at least one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity of individual level causes identified in aspect (7). The two ''axes'' describing most of the strategic variation among the species (see [2]), provide a simple explanation of community level pattern in terms of individual level processes.",,,,"Kobe, Richard K/M-1054-2014; Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011","Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148",,,,,789,817,15,280,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The major ions exhibited seasonality showing high concentrations in the winter and low concentrations in the summer, while other variables did not exhibit seasonality. The hysteresis diagrams indicate that the seasonal pattern of major ions is different from natural systems. The lack of flow relationships for metals and other sediment related variables also differs from natural systems. These differences result from impact of reservoirs on the river processes.

A number of empirical models have been produced supporting this view. However, validation of such models has often been lacking or insufficient. Two methods for checking the validity of such models are presented. The first method is to derive a model for one population and test it against another data set. The second method is to evaluate the forecasting power of the model. For these purposes, the relation between 36 weather variables and population parameters of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, black grouse T. tetrix, and hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia was studied using population data (1964 - 1984) from three adjacent provinces in Finland. Total population size, number of juveniles and population growth rate were used as dependent variables. Prior to the analyses, the population data were In-transformed and detrended. Stepwise regression analysis was used with province-specific weather data as explanatory variables. These models were then used to make forecasts one year ahead for each species and province, and the prediction was tested against observed data. Transferred models from the other provinces were also used. The requirement for a good empirical model is that it should be possible to use the model on similar problems in nearby areas. Stepwise regression analyses yielded reasonable fits in most cases ((R) over bar (2) ranging between 0.2 - 1.0). However, a model from a given province invariably produced a poor fit when applied to another province. Forecasting the population dynamics was only occasionally successful, and was not directly related to the fit of the models. The results suggest that it may often be hazardous to use weather data for predicting population fluctuations of game species, especially for management purposes. This conclusion was further strengthened by demonstrating that using 36 province-specific white noise variables, it was possible to build models with fit and forecasting properties essentially equal to those of the weather-based models.",,,,,"Lindstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5630-6680",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland,"I thank Hanna Kokko and Esa Ranta for inspiring discussions and for commenting on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Three major determinants of bees' nectar-foraging patterns are the maximum depth at which nectar is accessible (dependent on bee tongue length); the minimum profitable energy content per flower (dependent on foraging costs and hence on bee body mass); and the minimum threshold temperature for flight. These form the axes of a three-dimensional template, the competition box. 2. Thresholds of depth, cost and temperature can be identified for each species of bee, delimiting domains within the box compatible with foraging by each bee species. 3. Changes through a day in temperature and in the depth and sugar content of nectar define the nectar trajectory through the box for a flower species in relation to microclimate and bee activity. 4. This approach allows systematic appraisal of the roles of accessibility, energy content and temperature in interspecific competition among bees for nectar, and draws attention to situations in which additional factors may be important. 5. By superimposing a bee-species-specific template on a representative nectar trajectory for a given flower species in a given situation, it is possible to make reasoned guesses about the expected interactions of foraging bee species with a novel flower species and with each other in a novel situation. Such guesses are required for evaluating the expected impact of honey-bees and other introduced pollinators on the pollination system of crops and natural vegetation. 6.

Bioclimate data have been computed on a 50 km grid across Europe. Along with published maps of higher plant distributions based upon the same grid, these data have been used to derive climate response surfaces that model the relationship between a species' distribution and the present climate. Eight species representative of a variety of phytogeographic patterns have been investigated. The results support the hypothesis that the European distributions of all eight species are principally determined by macroclimate and illustrate the nature of the climatic constraints upon each species. Simulated future distributions in equilibrium with 2 x CO2 climate scenarios derived from two alternative GCMs show that all of the species are likely to experience major shifts in their potential range if such climatic changes take place. Some species may suffer substantial range and population reductions and others may face the threat of extinction. The rate of the forecast climate changes is such that few, if any, species may be able to maintain their ranges in equilibrium with the changing climate. In consequence, the transient impacts upon ecosystems will be varied but often may lead to a period of dominance by opportunist, early-successional species. Our simulations of potential ranges take no account of such factors as photoperiod or the direct effects of CO2, both of which may substantially alter the realized future equilibrium.",,,,"Cramer, Wolfgang/B-8221-2008","Cramer, Wolfgang/0000-0002-9205-5812; Berry, Pam/0000-0002-1201-072X",,,,,278,290,2,73,,,,0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Three vital rates considered are the daily stage-specific instantaneous mortality rate, stage duration and daily age-specific fecundity per female. The models incorporate variability in growth rates among individuals and link simpler stage-based and more complicated individual-based modeling approaches. The elasticity of population growth rate for anchovy percentage change from a 1% change of a vital rate was greatest for mortality in yolk-sac larvae, fecundity of 2 yr old fish (111 to 135 mm), and stage duration in late larvae (11 to 35 mm). For sardine, elasticity was greatest for mortality in life stages of egg and yolk-sac larvae, fecundity of 5 and 6 yr old fish (211 to 250 mm), and stage duration in the early larvae (5 to 10 mm). When stage duration was variable, elasticity was 1/10 as large as when stage duration was constant, indicating that sensitivity of populations to changes in vital rates is reduced by variation in growth rates. Population growth rates for both species increased with variance in individual growth rates. Thus, a population with individuals that grow at varying rates is more likely to increase. Our models indicate that growth rates are important determinants of population growth and recruitment and it is Likely that growth and mortality rates are linked. We suggest, therefore, that inexpensive estimates of larval growth rates could be used to help forecast future recruitment.",,,,,,,,,,44,44,0,13,,,,0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar. Ecol.-Prog.

Passive greenhouse apparatus is commonly used to investigate the in situ biological response of terrestrial communities to global warming. 2. Although close conformity of greenhouse treatment effects to general circulation model (GCM) scenarios is widely claimed, no proof of such a relationship has yet been published. 3. Here, the relationship between passive greenhouse thermal environment and future climate conditions is considered using temperature data collected from within and without greenhouses deployed in the maritime Antarctic. It is revealed that in terms of thermal extremes, diel and annual variation, and overall distribution across the temperature spectrum, such apparatus achieves only poor simulation of GCM forecasts. 4. During summer, greenhouses induce an amplified daily range of temperatures, elevated maxima and accelerated rates of change. 5. During spring and autumn, diel temperature variation continues inside the greenhouses while snow cover protects the controls. 6. During winter, an inverse treatment effect occurs, in which the relative depth of snow cover causes lower temperatures in greenhouses than in controls. 7. These treatment effects differ significantly from GCM climate predictions. Changes recorded in the composition, structure and function of greenhouse biota may thus be artefacts of the methodology. 8. Thorough a priori testing of greenhouse treatment effects is recommended for future climate change studies that are to be conducted in environments subject to seasonal snowfall, solar elevation and day length.",,,,,,,,,,38,40,2,21,,,,0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The response surface also provides a simulation of the extent of the area of native distribution of F. japonica in Southeast Asia that is generally accurate, confirming the robustness of the static correlative model upon which it is based. Simulations of the potential distribution of F. japonica under two alternative 2 x CO2 climate change scenarios indicate the likelihood of considerable spread into higher latitudes and possible eventual exclusion of the species from central Europe. However, despite the robustness of the response surface with present-day climate, the reliability of these simulations as forecasts is likely to be limited because no account is taken of the direct effects of CO2 and their interaction with the species' physiological responses to climate. Similarly, no account is taken of the potential impact of interactions with 'new' species as ecosystems change in composition in response to climate change.

Lake sediments, however, can be used as natural archives of perturbation histories, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. At present the use of simple weighted averaging models permits the reconstruction of a variety of water chemical variables from diatom and other microfossils preserved in lake sediments (pH, total phosphorus, salinity and lakewater temperature). Sediment records can, therefore, provide lake-specific background data for lake management as well as information about their ecological histories. The common models used in palaeolimnology (dating, transfer-functions) are reviewed and their role in environmental monitoring discussed. Predictions of future lake water quality following lake restoration methods tend to be made from dynamic mathematical models, but they are also used for hindcasting (e.g. the MAGIC model of catchment acidification). A problem with using dynamic models is that they are often site-specific and require calibration for a given lake. Combined with reliable dating, chemical reconstructions from microfossil-based transfer functions offer the possibility of testing hindcast predictions derived from dynamic mathematical models, e.g. for salinity, TP and pH. In this way, sediment microfossil-based models can assist with the parameterization of more complex, dynamic models of contemporary processes. In this review, comparisons between the two approaches (sediment-based and dynamic models) are given and possible future interactions outlined. Validation of mathematical models by palaeolimnological data might enhance their predictive ability when used for forecasting lake recovery. There is clearly, however, a need for a more rigorous approach to palaeolimnology, i.e. critical hypothesis generation. Multidisciplinary studies of lake disturbance, that combine palaeolimnology, dynamic modelling and contemporary process studies, would also be beneficial.",,,,,,,,,,39,40,2,29,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The statistical analysis of our measurements and adjustments reveal similarities in the reaction of Picea abies and Picea sitchensis to a doubling of the present level of atmospheric CO2. Regarding the photosynthesis response curves to intercellular CO2 variation, we noted a decrease in the maximum photosynthesis rate and the carboxylation rate accompanied by an increased compensation point. Regarding the photosynthesis response curves to the light variation, we found that dark respiration and photochemical efficiency remained unchanged, and the maximum photosynthesis rate was slightly higher in an atmosphere enriched in CO2.

We assume that these models have the complementary goals of understanding the processes that influence the number and distribution of animals in space and time, and forecasting the effect of management or other human activities on population abundance and distribution. Incorrect model structure, parameter estimates, or both will result in unreliable model output. Spatially explicit models require knowledge of population spatial structure, dispersal, and movement rates, in addition to the usual demographic parameters and structural assumptions such as density-dependence, and are thus potentially very vulnerable to propagation of model uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis and validation can both be used to evaluate the reliability of SEPMs, but the level of spatiotemporal resolution at which the model should be evaluated is often not clear. Many SEPMs are very complex, and validation may only be possible or meaningful on a sub-model basis. Forecasting, that is, prediction under a different set of conditions than that under which the model was built, will provide a stronger test of model reliability. Forecasts from SEPMs can be used to generate hypotheses that can then be tested as parts of large-scale adaptive management experiments.

Here, treatment effects upon temperature (magnitude, range, variation, rates of change), moisture (humidity, precipitation, soil water content), light (intensity, spectral distribution), gas composition, snow cover, and wind speed are reviewed in the context of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions. It is revealed that greenhouses modify each of these potentially limiting factors in a complex and interactive manner, but that the relationship between this modification and forecast conditions of climate change is poor. Interpretation of biological responses, and their extrapolation to predictive models, is thus unreliable. In order that future greenhouse experiments may overcome criticisms of artefact and lack of rigour, two amendments to methodology are proposed: (1) objective-orientated design of greenhouse apparatus (2) multiple controls addressing individual environmental factors.

Four main types of longitudinal distribution were emphasised: macrophytes could be upstream-specific or - tolerant, downstream-specific, -tolerant or mainly downstream, ubiquitous or confined to one tributary. The ecological tendencies of some macrophytes were pointed out from ecological profiles. Vegetational groups were determined by correspondence analysis: sunny upstream areas were dominated by heliophilous vascular spring hydrophytes while shaded upstream areas were characterised by aquatic bryophytes; in the larger downstream brooks, three layers were observed: helophytes, vascular rheophytes and aquatic bryophytes. The comparison with the two other levels showed how mapping was useful to emphasise species distribution. A possible misinterpretation of macrophyte ecology was pointed out when studing ecological profiles in a particular brook versus a stratified sampling on the river basin. The intermediate position of the brook in regard to the general typology of the river watercourse, and also its particularities due to general eutrophication of main course were shown.

Ground-nesting birds made up 54% of the population (374+/-70SE in 21 colonies) and tree-nesting ones the remainder (92+/-338SE in seven colonies). Deterministic modeling led to a forecast of 27,000 pairs in 1993. In order to halt further damage to unique and restricted insular forest ecosystems, a five-year culling program was introduced in 1989 with the following goals: to reduce the breeding population to 10,000 pairs and to discourage tree-nesting. Modeling revealed that these goals could only be attained by lowering recruitment (egg-spraying) in accessible ground nests and by reducing the number of adults in inaccessible forest habitats al the same time. The dual approach-spraying 75% of all nests (5,051+/-279SE/y) with inert mineral oil in ground-nesting colonies and culling (1,979+/-66SE/y) breeding birds in arboreal ones-has since reversed population trends. By 1991, three years after the beginning of the program, the estuarine population fell to 12,000 pairs. Periodic control measures Mill be needed at the end of the five-year program to maintain the population at the 10,000 pairs level.",,,,,,,,,,37,37,0,10,,,,0738-6028,,,COLON WATERBIRD,Colon.

Five climatically-distinct regions in the shadscale, sagebrush-steppe, sagebrush-semidesert, and open pine with grass communities of California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah were included in the analysis. The amount of associated variance ranged from 43 to 62% between area burned and seasonal climatic variables. Results show that the seasonal climate that promotes fires is distinctly regional, even in areas of similar vegetation. However, the area burned increases primarily when the climate favors the growth of annual grasses over perennial species, or promotes either cooler or wetter conditions during the previous summer (fire) seasons.

Fish population dynamics were density-dependent, and harvest by anglers followed a sigmoid functional response. The deterministic form of the model was stable and suggested that the fishery could withstand relatively high exploitation rates. The stochastic form of the model compared management strategies using the probabilities of increased or decreased fish and angler populations and the probability that fish populations will fall below a threshold level. These calculations exposed high risks associated with management strategies based on deterministic, equilibrium equations. The probabilities of sustaining both the fish stock and angler effort increase if harvest rates are reduced below the optimum derived from deterministic models. Consideration of angler dynamics reduced the prediction error of fish stock forecasts and substantially altered risk assessments and management recommendations. If angler dynamics were ignored, the optimal exploitation rate and the risk of overfishing would be overestimated. Lake sport fishery assessments can be improved by coupling models of fish dynamics at the scale of individual lakes with angler models at the larger scale of lake districts.",,,,,,,,,,35,36,0,11,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Data from a 645-taxa Philippines-wide food web and multiple regression models were used to predict population fluctuations of insect pests in a rice field. Independent variables of pest models included the biomass of rice plants in the field, the abundance of each pest, and the abundances of five highly correlated enemies of the pest, all as functions of time. 2. To test the ability of the models to reveal effects of insecticide spraying, a rice field at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines was divided into deltamethrin-sprayed and unsprayed plots. Data on the abundance of seven pest species (Nephotettix virescens, Recilia dorsalis, Sogatella furcifera, Nilaparvata lugens, Hydrellia philippina, Ne. nigropictus and Cofana spectra) and their natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) were collected during the dry season of 1990. 3. Spraying insecticide disorganized the population dynamics of insect species feeding in the IRRI field. Multiple regression models were less able in the sprayed plot than in the unsprayed plot to forecast the population fluctuations of pest species on the basis of various numbers and combinations of independent variables. For example, current pest abundance, by itself, was a significant predictor of future pest abundance for four of the seven pests (Ne. virescens, R. dorsalis, S. furcifera, H. philippina) in the unsprayed plot, but significant fits were found for only two pests (R. dorsalis, H. philippina) in the insecticide-sprayed plot. 4. In the unsprayed plot, independent variables were significant predictors of future pest abundance in four of seven initial models compared to one of seven models in the sprayed plot. Step-wise removal of independent variables in the models enhanced their forecasting power in both the sprayed and unsprayed plots, but significant models in the unsprayed plot nearly always outnumbered those in the sprayed plot. 5. In the unsprayed plot, Ne. virescens retained five of seven independent variables as significant predictors, compared to four for S. furcifera, three for C. spectra, and one for the remaining four pests. Classical models that contain one or two species as independent variables may not be sufficient to forecast future abundances of some Philippine rice pests in unsprayed and sprayed plots. 6. In general, models that included interaction terms and either the presence or absence of sprays among the independent variables did not improve the forecasting power of models in either the sprayed or unsprayed plot. 7. The methods developed here for studying the impact of spraying on the organization of arthropod communities in rice fields could be applied to other interventions besides spraying (such as the introduction of genetically engineered cultivars), other biotic communities besides arthropods, and other crops besides rice.",,,,"Heong, KL/Z-4533-2019; HEONG, K L/F-1495-2013",,,,,,62,76,2,29,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The present paper examines models which more closely mimic natural conditions, in which the gene frequencies in migrant groups are subject to stochastic effects. It is shown that some types of stochastic migration can cause dramatic changes in spatial correlations and variance. These changes depend on how the stochastic migration effects in the gene frequency recursion equations are shared among nearby subpopulations during the same generation. Only for cases where the effects are completely unshared are the equilibrium spatial and space-time correlations among adult subpopulations unaffected, but the variance is always inflated. The analyses here use novel methods, by recasting population genetic migration-drift models as space-time autoregressive moving average (STARMA) processes. Recent theorems for STARMA processes are employed for finding the spatial correlations, and for the first time in population genetics theory the complete set of space-time correlations, for systems with general patterns of migration rates and numbers of spatial dimensions. The space-time correlations provide a uniquely detailed description of a system, and thus form a link between observed spatial autocorrelation statistics and the underlying space-time population genetic process. STARMA theoretical processes have direct statistical analogues that can be applied for process identification, parameter estimation, model fitting, and forecasting in real systems.

Using size-structured demographic models, we analyzed the status of the tortoise in the Western Mojave desert and evaluated the effectiveness of possible management measures. Our demographic analyses agree with the trends reported by field censuses in showing rapid population decline. Importantly, simulations that include variation and correlation in vital rates yield highly variable forecasts of population growth, indicating the uncertainties inherent in even short-term projections of tortoise population sizes. To determine where conservation efforts and data collection should be focused, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses in which the effects of changing different vital rates were quantified. We found that the rate of population growth is most sensitive to the survival of large adult females and that improving survival of this size class to reputably ''pristine'' rates could reverse population declines; in contrast, large improvements in other vital rates will not, alone, reverse population decline. Thus, shooting, off-road vehicles, upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), and other major sources of adult mortality should be the primary focus of management strategies. Finally, we discuss the impact of the proposed expansion of the U.S. Army's Fort Irwin, which would reduce the Western Mojave tortoise population by less-than-or-equal-to 13%. We argue that the expansion could have a grave impact on the long-term population viability of the tortoise, but that this impact will be a function of the management of remaining tortoise habitat. We conclude that, although many anthropogenic impacts threaten the tortoise, the species' future could be bright, provided that research and land-use planning focus on biologically important aspects of its life history.",,,,"Gaolach, Brad/K-5962-2019","Gaolach, Brad/0000-0003-4499-3975",,,,,253,263,2,127,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The capability of passive microwave sensors to monitor the earth, regardless of cloud cover or daylight, and the 1400 km swath width (SSM/I) make these sensors well suited not only for ice forecasting but also for providing information needed for planning northern oceanic routes. The retrieval of sea ice parameters is carried out by utilizing 37 and 19 GHz brightness temperatures measured by Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platform. The ice type identification uses a-priory established signature brightness temperatures for each ice type. The algorithm generating the sea ice information contains some climatological information on the weather dependence of the observed brightness temperature. A comparison between passive microwave (SSM/I) retrieved ice parameters and ice maps from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI) indicates that the weather correcting procedure within the algorithm may need regionalized input. The correlation of variability of the observed brightness temperatures with the weather changes has to be derived prior to introducing any corrections to the existing algorithms. The observed brightness temperatures contain information not only about the ice surface but also the atmospheric contribution. One of the crucial tasks is to establish a technique for flagging changes on the ice surface in order to segregate them from the atmospheric influence on the passive microwave signal. To obtain more knowledge about the effects of regional weather on the retrieval of sea ice parameters, local climatological information from DNMI has been compared with the SSM/I ice charts.

In particular, we demonstrate that simple moving average filters can falsely suggest that a white noise data set is chaotic by using a test commonly used by biologists.

Nest initiation occurred 1-6 days ((x) over bar = 2.5 +/- 0.8) before peak spring run-off and was relatively stable for 6 years; median nest initiation dates varied about 9 days between earliest and latest years. Spring phenology was not the primary determinant of annual productivity, but did influence nest density (overall (x) over bar = 6.1 +/- 0.6 [SE] nests/km(2)); high nest densities occurred in years with an early spring breakup, and low densities in years with late spring breakup. Total clutch size (TCS), clutch size at hatch (CSH), and goslings leaving nest (GLN) were not associated with phenology. TCS ((x) over bar = 4.75 +/- 0.06) varied slightly among years, but CSH ((x) over bar = 4.38 +/- 0.09) and GLN ((x) over bar = 3.85 +/- 0.10) were relatively stable. Habitat type and vegetative structure of the nest site were not associated with nest success. Partial predation of clutches was stable ((x) over bar = 7.6 +/- 1% of eggs laid) among years and was not related to observer influence. Hatch success also was stable among years (88 +/- 2% of the eggs remaining at hatch). Nest success varied overall among years ((x) over bar = 62.9 +/- 8%), but was stable at 82 +/- 2% from the end of week 2 of incubation through hatch and at 94 +/- 3% from the end of week 3 through hatch.

Inland areas also are used as brood-rearing areas by some geese.

The first is that historical epidemics show various 'fieldmarks' of chaos, such as positive Lyapunov exponents. Second, phase portraits reconstructed from real-world epidemiological time series bear a striking resemblance to chaotic solutions obtained from certain epidemiological models. Both lines of evidence are subject to dispute: the algorithms used to look for the fieldmarks can be fooled by short, noisy time series, and the same fieldmarks can be generated by stochastic models in which there is demonstrably no chaos at all. In the present paper, we compare the predictive abilities of stochastic models with those of mechanistic scenarios that admit to chaotic solutions. The main results are as follows: (i) the mechanistic models outperform their stochastic counterparts; (ii) forecasting efficacy of the deterministic models is maximized by positing parameter values that induce chaotic behaviour; (iii) simple mechanistic models are equal if not superior to more detailed schemes that include age structure; and (iv) prediction accuracy for monthly notifications declines rapidly with time, so that, from a practical standpoint, the results are of little value.

While validation is such a process, it has tended to focus on the in-sample goodness-of-fit properties of models. Good performance at the model estimation and calibration stage, however, does not guarantee correct predictions. Despite the emphasis on prediction in many ecological and environmental models, predictive validation techniques are typically ignored in the modelling literature. Drawing on the econometric and statistical forecasting literature, this paper reviews the available methods and suggests that a structured approach to predictive model validation be adopted. The approach assumes the candidate models have been validated in-sample and proposes that the models first be evaluated for statistical adequacy before being compared and ranked. The evaluative phase eliminates models with poor statistical properties. The comparative phase selects, from the subset of statistically adequate models, the model with the best predictive properties. The approach is argued to increase user confidence and help ensure that the results of modelling exercises are effectively and appropriately used in ecological and environmental decision-making processes.",,,,,,,,,,195,196,2,18,,,,0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Such a potentially dramatic change in climate could easily cause dramatic biological responses, including extinction Species show a wide range of responses to climate, and consequently the response of different species of plants and animals to climatic change will be quite variable. This implies a likelihood for a disassembling of natural communities and for transient nonequilibrium restructuring of habitats as climatic change unfolds. Validated models that help forecast these events are needed to aid scientists in better understanding the ecological ramifications of global climatic change. Also, and perhaps more important for conservation biology, such validated models can help provide probabilities for the occurrence of these events, which will allow policy makers to make better, informed decisions. Typically, the study plots of most ecological field work are tennis-court-sized, while the smallest resolved scales in global climatic models are about 500 x 500 km. Computer limitations preclude significant reduction in scales of climatic models. Consequently, more multi-species ecological studies are needed over broad geographic and long temporal scales. We Provide an example of large-scale ecological response studies, namely the case of wintering North American birds. We also provide an example of attempts to translate results of large-scale climatic models (at a 500 x 500 km scale) to a mesoscale (50 X 50 km). Participation of climatologists with ecologists at early stages in research planning can help bridge the scale mismatch between climatic and ecological measurement, and provide more reliable estimates of community responses to century-long, time-evolving patterns of climatic change We are convinced that many more such interdisciplinary research attempts are urgently needed if the scientific community is to produce information useful to the development of conservation strategies.

Mechanisms of plant response to these changes need to be incorporated in models that predict crop yield estimates to obtain an understanding of the potential consequences of such changes. This is particularly important in Asia where demographic forecasts indicate that rice supplies worldwide will need to increase by 1.6% annually to the year 2000 to match population growth estimates. The objectives of this paper are (1) to review the major hypotheses and/or experimental results regarding rice sensitivity to climate change and (2) to evaluate the suitability of existing rice models for assessing the impact of global climate change on rice production. A review of four physiologically-based rice models (RICEMOD, CERES-Rice, MACROS, RICESYS) illustrates their potential to predict rice responses to elevated CO2 and increased temperature. RICEMOD does not respond to increases in CO2 nor to large increases in temperature. Both MACROS and CERES (wetland rice) responses to temperature and CO2 agree with recent experimental data. RICESYS is an ecosystem model which predicts herbivory and inter-species competition between rice and weeds but does not respond to CO2.

Climatic correlations have been established for two introduced invasive plant species Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) in north-west Europe. These two species represent examples of perennial and annual vegetation respectively. In accordance with the model predictions, the northern distribution limit of F. japonica was found to be controlled by two climatic variables-the length of the growing season, measured in day-degrees, and the minimum temperature-while for I. glandulifera only the length of the growing season was critical. Experimental verification of the results is crucial for understanding the mechanisms operating to limit plant distributions. By use of the predictions established by the climatic correlations for I. glandulifera and F. japonica, maps have been produced forecasting the potential northward spread of both species on the basis of a 1.5-degrees-C and a 4.5-degrees-C rise in global mean surface air-temperature. These temperatures represent the minimum and maximum increases predicted to occur by general circulation models for a doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. For a global temperature increase of 1.5-degrees-C the maps demonstrate a maximum northward spread of F. japonica from a latitude of 63-degrees to 68-degrees-N and for I. glandulifera from 64-degrees up to 69-degrees-N. The greater temperature increase of 4.5-degrees-C indicates a considerable potential for expansion in the range of F. japonica in Norway and Sweden but a distribution which was restricted along the eastern coast of Sweden and southern Finland. In contrast, I. glandulifera could colonize the whole of the Fennoscandinavian area. The predictions are made assuming no migrational lag and no soil 'incompatibility'. Geographical differences in the patterns of spread between the species were explained with reference to the different factors affecting perennial and annual vegetation.",,,,"Beerling, David/C-2840-2009","Beerling, David/0000-0003-1869-4314",,,,,85,90,2,99,,,,0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

A computer model is described which simulates the spread of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) by aphids in winter cereals in SW England. The model has as a theoretical base the dynamic interaction between two temperature-dependent rate processes: (i) the frequency of virus transmission to uninfected plants by infected aphids, and (ii) the frequency of virus acquisition by uninfected aphids from infected plants. A distinction is made between virus spread into crops by alate migrant vectors (primary transmission), and more localized spread within crops mainly by apterous vectors (secondary transmission). Both types of spread may occur concurrently. Probabilities of multiple infection, and effects of this on the rate processes in the model, are described by a generalized frequency distribution. Vector dispersal and the latent periods, following transmission and acquisition of virus, are represented as constant functions of thermal time. 2. Simulations used field data of plant and aphid populations sampled every few weeks in crops of winter barley and wheat at Long Ashton near Bristol during 1978-89. The infectivity of autumn migrant aphids caught each year in a suction trap was measured by feeding transmission tests. Daily max-min screen temperatures used to estimate thermal time were obtained from records at Long Ashton. Crop infections were assessed from visible symptoms or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 3. The model was successfully validated for 61 cereal crops with 0-80% of the crop area affected. There was no significant divergence between field observations and incidence of BYDV as predicted by the model (barley, r = 0.98; wheat, r = 0.94). Curves of epidemic development obtained by measuring virus incidence at frequent intervals during crop growth were usually similar to those generated by the model. Prospects for practical and more reliable forecasting of BYDV epidemics, and of the need for control measures, are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,23,23,1,7,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J. Appl.

The flight phenologies of the cereal aphids Sitobion avenae and Metopolophium dirhodum, as indicated by suction trap catches at 18 sites throughout Great Britain between 1975 and 1984, were compared using multivariate methods. 2. Generalized Procrustes analysis identified trends in the phenologies of both species that were not clear from principal coordinate analysis alone. 3. The 18 sites were grouped into the same eight regions for both species, which confirmed broadly that sites relatively closer had more similar flight phenologies. 4. The flight phenologies of both species followed a general south-north trend but with separate components each side of latitude 54-degrees-N, that to the south being oriented from south-south-west to north-north-east, that to the north from south-south-east to north-north-west. There were slight orientation differences between species. An explanation for this is proposed based on winter temperature clines. 5. For M. dirhodum the date of first catch and date of achievement of 25, 50 and 75% of total seasonal catch were generally later with increasing distance north; for S. avenae these trends were present but weaker south of latitude 54-degrees-N. For both species these trends were slightly more variable south of latitude 54-degrees-N. The duration between achievement of 25 and 75% of total seasonal catch was shorter at sites north of latitude 54-degrees-N for both species, but more markedly so for S. avenae. 6. The range in the above phenological events averaged over years was greater for M. dirhodum than for S. avenae. The range of date of first catch was greater than the range of date by which 25 or 50% of the total catch was achieved, for both species. The ranges of date by which 75% of the total catch was achieved were markedly different in the north and south of Britain for both species. 7. The consistency of the flight phenologies between years varied independently for each species and was greater for S. avenae. However, for both species 1978 and 1981 were unusual, the date of first catch being earlier and the season extended later, especially at southern sites. 8.

About 90% of the pairs remained together from one breeding season to the next. Only 2.4% of the pairs divorced, most mate changes being consequences of the death of one partner. Divorces were not forecast by low reproductive success, and seemed to be accidental. In the season before mate change, there was no difference in reproductive performance, measured as clutch size, hatching date, and number of fledged young, between faithful pairs and pairs where one partner was subsequently changed. However, in the first season with a new partner, clutch size and number of fledged young decreased on average. Hence, because mate change led to a reduction in reproductive success, it was concluded that mate retention is advantageous. Our results suggest that this reduction is more likely due to the lower average age or breeding experience of new partners than to the benefits of breeding experience with one particular partner.

As an example of this type of interaction, we focus attention on larval cannibalism of eggs in the flour beetle Tribolium. As we do not consider any benefit of cannibalism for larvae, the dynamics of this interaction are the same as those of competition where a later life stage preempts resources used by an earlier life stage. (2) A mathematical model of the egg - larval interaction allows for the evaluation of the impact of the duration of the egg and larval intervals, fecundity, survival and cannibalism rates on the stability of the equilibrium number of larvae. (3) The local stability boundary, which separates the region of parameter space leading only to unstable equilibria and oscillations from that region yielding the possibility of stable equilibria, is dramatically modified by the inclusion of age-dependence in the cannibalism by larvae. In contrast to a model ignoring this age-dependence, the model which includes age-dependence predicts that all flour beetle clutures should display oscillations in larval numbers. (4) Review of over a half-century of Tribolium experiments is consistent with the model's forecast: egg and larval numbers oscillate in all reported data sets.",,,,"Hastings, Alan/O-6864-2019; Hastings, Alan/A-7423-2008","Hastings, Alan/0000-0002-0717-8026; ",,,,,36,37,1,15,,,,0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In regional studies of surface-water acidification, annual means of chemical variables are often used to describe differences and change. Outputs from hydrochemical models are often in the form of mean values, which are used in biological models, and these, in turn, are usually derived from responses to mean conditions. Thus, biological forecasts are constrained to ignore the possible effects of the short-term variations in water chemistry which characterize acid streams. This approach requires appraisal. 2. Here, regional Welsh data and daily records from a smaller number of streams were used to investigate the estimation of pH parameters. Variations in aluminium concentration in relation to pH were also assessed. Empirical relationships between invertebrate assemblages, fish populations, mean stream chemistry and measures of fluctuation in pH and aluminium concentration were explored. 3. In general, pH or Al variability and mean pH or Al in Welsh streams were closely related, so that the biological influences of episodes could not easily be separated from those of chronic conditions. Mean pH and mean aluminium concentration were the most effective pH and aluminium statistics used in multivariate models of trout density, which were not improved by including other pH or aluminium variables. For models of invertebrate assemblages based on mean pH or mean aluminium, the inclusion of variables related to episodicity (e.g. pH minimum, aluminium maximum) gave moderate increases in precision. 4. This analysis indicates that it is reasonable to use means of stream chemical variables in biological models of acidification. Consideration of chemical variability could give improvements in some cases, but at the expense of increased model complexity and effort in parameter selection. Nevertheless, we emphasize the need for accurate calibration of both biological and hydrochemical models.",,,,"Ormerod, Steve J/A-4326-2010","Ormerod, Steve J/0000-0002-8174-302X",,,,,41,41,0,3,,,,0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The model calculates the vertical hydrothermal and water-quality structure as a function of inflowing waters, meteorology and reservoir operation. It considers selective withdrawal as a result of the operation of spillways, intake for turbines and bottom outlets. The example herein is a study of the feasibility of a bottom outlet in altering water-quality tendencies of an Amazon hydroelectric power project - Cachoeira Porteira Reservoir - which filling forecast to first half of 1995. In order to obtain more realism in respect of water-quality dynamics of Amazon reservoirs, some modifications were introduced at the original model version, which was also adapted to 16-bit microcomputer hardware. A large hydrological series of averaged monthly flow rates was studied, and two sequential years were chosen for obtaining a critical reservoir water-quality situation. Field water-quality data from distinct hydrological periods were used, and daily local meteorological information was considered. The simulations involved four hypotheses, with consideration of different flow rates through a bottom outlet. The alterations to reservoir water-quality tendencies were analysed, emphasising the intensity of stratification, eutrophication, and anoxic conditions caused by the flooding of natural vegetation. The results show the low influence of bottom outlet utilization in the specific case of Cachoeira Porteira Reservoir water quality. Some considerations involving the features of the dam outlet structures and the simulations results are discussed.",,,,"Araujo Filho, Moacyr/B-1167-2013","Araujo Filho, Moacyr/0000-0001-8462-6446",,,,,5,7,0,6,,,,0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.
