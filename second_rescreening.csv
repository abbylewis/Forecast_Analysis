FirstComment,NA,7 day ahead forecasting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"modelling study of potential future spread of plant pathogen, unclear if they used forecasted drivers",NA,NA,the only forecasting done (based on abstract) is on scenarios which are not testable,NA,NA,NA,I couldn't find the paper. Might have something to do with the fact that it was published in the Soviet Journal of Ecology lol.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,they used fetus weight to predict when calves would be birthed?? unclear how this could be estimated BEFORE the calves were born,NA,NA,I can't find the actual paper online,"Even though the main focus of the paper is management decision-making, I think there is also sufficient discussion of their forecasting to justify inclusion.",My best guess is that it is <10yr based on the model descriptions but this will definitely be a paper we review further.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,After a quick skim of the article it looks like this is hindcasting of herring from the 1930's,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,found pdf on Google scholar:Check randon effects:Potentially - there is discussion that they converted the emission strength per unit area into a dimensionless parameter that was a multiplication factor to compute the pollen concentraions for each 12km2 grid,NA,NA,NA,"im putting this as yes for question 3, but it was a water quality paper",NA,NA,NA,"Another ""Soviet Journal of Ecology"" paper. Couldn't find abstract nor paper.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,found abstract online but not full text so we shall see...,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I am really looking forward to this one.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cool paper. However, it is really tough differentiating the teleconnection components that were used to predict future productivity in the past. Cool concept though",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"fire is the response for this forecast, is this an ecological variable??","Is this actual forecasts or an assessment how well Zebra memory allows them to migrate to a specific location? (e.g. memory mechanisms) I ran this by D, a psychologist who knows a few things about memory and perception and she had MANY thoughts (none very good) about how they approached this.  This is a really interesting case study because it is almost parameterizing the forecast horizon using NDVI data from the past, averaging it over the 2mo, 4mo, and 6mo, time periods, and then making that a momeory mechanism to predict where they would go. It is almost like their forecast model was how we might think of a null model to test how differnet memory times from Zebras could predict their location. So, it is almost like a spatial forecast that really does not have an exact horizon. This is how I read it at least...",NA,NA,NA,NA,"i don't think that number of fish caught is necessarily biogeochemical or organismal, but its related to population",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"So they made forecasts using equation free modeling. Stochasitc Chaos. Chaos predicts algae.,, great.",NA,yeah - but are any of the forecasts from 1992 actually assessed?

While they are technically producing a forecast using data from the past, it is from the 1930s and so a lot of the questions we would be interested in for the matrix do not apply (e.g. cyberinfrastructure, uncertainty, even forecast assessment metricx).
