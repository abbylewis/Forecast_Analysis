While they are technically producing a forecast using data from the past, it is from the 1930s and so a lot of the questions we would be interested in for the matrix do not apply (e.g. cyberinfrastructure, uncertainty, even forecast assessment metricx). I don't think this one should be included personally. Abby: I am going to include it for now because it seems to meet our criteria","yes; 10-yr forecast of fisheries under different mgmt. scenarios","yes; annual hindcast of penguin nest count","yes it does","is a forecast!"
