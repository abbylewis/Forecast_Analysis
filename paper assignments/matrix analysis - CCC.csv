"Comment","","","","","","My best guess is that it is <10yr based on the model descriptions but this will definitely be a paper we review further. ","","","","","wind erosion of soil?? potential effects on biogeochemical cycling for sure but not necessarily specifically addressed","I mean, it is pecan. So inherently it is forecasting, right? I would be curious to actually read the whole paper. ","Even though the main focus of the paper is management decision-making, I think there is also sufficient discussion of their forecasting to justify inclusion.",""
"SecondComment","yes forecast; 3 days ahead","I *think* when they say they used predictor variables over teh previous 7-9 days, they really mean they are predicting 7-9 days in advance, making this a real forecast","yes; I *think* they were using hindcasted drivers for at least part of the dataset although the way they describe divvying up their training/testing/forecasting period is pretty tough to follow","I think this could be called an ensemble of models","yes; annual hindcast of penguin nest count","5 day forecasts","yes; annual hindcasts of cod","yes a forecast","yes!","yep","I think this is ecological","yes","This one is hard. What they are really forecasting is fish population a year into the future, and they don't directly evaluate those forecasts. I am going to include it for now because it technically meets all of our criteria","forecast, but no model assessment/evaluation"
