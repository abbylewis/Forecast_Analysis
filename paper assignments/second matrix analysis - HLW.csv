"SecondComment","yep","yep","yes","I believe they use winter temperatures to predict summer tree die off","yes","One day ahead DO forecast","I believe they do forecast august 2007","yep","daily ET forecasts","yes","interesting. Most predictions are <10 years so I'm including it, but I would love a second opinion","this is a tough one. I think they use drivers that are lagged by at least one day, but I'm not sure they are actually 4 week forecasts like they claim. Found on sci hub","older paper, but seems to actually be forecasting","yes","so cool","one year ahead","yep","yes","I believe drivers have a sufficient lag to really be forecasting"
