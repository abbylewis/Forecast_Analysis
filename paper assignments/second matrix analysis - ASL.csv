"SecondComment","yep, et","interesting. Most predictions are <10 years so I'm including it, but I would love a second opinion","yes","yes","yes","cool!","I think this is technically a near term ecological forecast but it is going to be a chore to fill out in the matrix","I think so? Inputs seem to be lagged by at least a week","yes. They don't use any covariates other than observations","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","Leaving this one in for now because they say they do 10 day forecasts but I am struggling to determine whether drivers are forecasted without reading the whole paper","unavailable","Technically I think the diatom section here counts (not any other variables)","Should include!
