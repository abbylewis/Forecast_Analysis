1,274,The use of neural networks in the control of water quality,"In the treatment of raw water, to make it suitable for use as drinking-water, it is necessary to monitor and control colour as a key parameter of concern to the customer[1]. The ability to predict raw-water colour is a desirable feature in the optimisation of the treatment process. In order to remove this discoloration, a coagulant is added. The required dosage is affected by a combination of the six parameters: raw water colour, raw water pH, raw water turbidity, raw water conductivity, dosed water pH and raw water temperature. These six variables are continuously monitored, and may be used to predict the necessary setting for the coagulant flow valve. Raw-water colour is inherently non-linear as a time series relationship, arid it is difficult to achieve accurate modeling with conventional time series modeling techniques. This paper considers a number of possible methods including multiple regression, subtractive fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks (ANNs). From this prediction it is possible to calculate the required dose of coagulant to eliminate the discoloration. Results show that the ANN modeling scheme is as good as the other methods in forecasting the raw-water colour in river water, and lends itself to the design of an ANN controller for dispensing the appropriate dose of coagulant[2].",NA,"Waterworth, G",2000,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,1,0,1,NA,abby lewis,coagulant dose is not ecological,0,
3,384,Improving the accuracy and utility of harmful algal bloom forecasting systems,"One of the goals of harmful algal bloom (HAB) research has been to develop predictive capabilities for blooms. Major steps have been made towards this goal, including the development of physical-biological models of HAB species that simulate bloom dynamics in specific regions. In the Gulf of Maine region of the northeastern US, models have been developed that have considerable skill in simulating blooms of Alexandrium fundyense, the causative organism for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks in the region. This model is now being used for both short-term and long-term forecasts. This paper describes several ongoing activities that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the model and forecasts. These include efforts to streamline or minimize the sampling and analysis requirements of annual A. fundyense cyst surveys, efforts to quantitatively describe or characterize the severity of predicted outbreaks and plans to obtain real-time data on Alexandrium cell abundance and toxicity that can be assimilated into the models. Together, these and other activities are moving us towards an operational forecasting system for Alexandrium blooms in the region.",NA,"Anderson, DM; Keafer, BA; McGillicuddy, DJ; Solow, AR; Kleindinst, JL",2013,Article; Book Chapter,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,0,Not a forecast
4,470,A Comparison of ANN Architecture towards Predicting Cyanobacteria Abundance at Tropical Lake and Wetlands,"Algal blooms are becoming increasingly prevalent and serious water quality issues worldwide. Algal bloom events at water resources can cause taste and odor problems, damage the environment, and some algal classes like Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) which release toxins in water may lead to serious diseases or cause fatalities to human. Thus there is a need to develop computational models that can accurately forecast algal bloom which in turns provides valuable lead time for lake and reservoir management to take the necessary correction or preventive actions. This research focused on the feasibility of using artificial neural network (ANN) technology as a modeling and forecasting tool for Cyanobacteria. It also presents a thorough study on the co-relationship of system accuracy with the deployment of different ANN architectures namely Generalized Feed-Forward (GFF), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Recurrent Artificial Neural network (RNN). Historical data collected from tropical Putrajaya Lake and Wetlands served as the test case and the system accuracy is measured in terms of its root means square error (RMSE). The results indicate that the RMSE values are within acceptable range of 105 to 120 (cell/ml) whereby the model developed using RBF architecture out performed slightly better than other models. The high predictive accuracy indicates that with sufficient data, both in terms of the number of historical algal bloom events and availability of important predictor data, ANNs can serve as reliable, forecasting tools.",https://doi.org/10.3850/978-981-08-5716-5_T266,"Oh, JH; Malek, S; Ahmad, SMS; Salleh, A",2010,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,0,Delivered from Germany

8,,Comparative analysis of models integrating synoptic forecast data into potato late blight risk estimate systems,"Determinacy analysis, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and neural network models were compared for their accuracy in 5-day (120h) forecasts of daily potato late blight risk according to a modified-Wallin disease severity model. For 12 locations in Michigan, variables derived from extended forecast data (MEX) from the National Weather Service model output statistics (MOS) were compared with those similarly derived from Unedited Local Climatological Data (ULCD) for the growing seasons 2001-2004. The most effective model for late blight risk prediction based on comparison with risk estimated with ULCD was a resilient propagation (Rprop) neural network model with 49 variables and 10 hidden nodes. The neural network model had significantly higher overall accuracy than the other models, and was particularly successful at predicting risk values in June, July, and August when knowledge of potato late blight risk is most critical to growers making management decisions with regard to fungicide sprays and irrigation scheduling. The neural network model was also significantly more accurate than the regional average of days with no late blight risk (0.72%). For each of the four models, monthly accuracy at any single station was negatively correlated with the percentage of days per month classified as risk days for potato late blight (P = 0.01). Although no validation with disease data was conducted, such models are still useful in the context of advising growers of forecast conditions that may be favorable for late blight according to model values, such as Wallin style disease severity values, with which they are familiar.

9,,Use of medium-range numerical weather prediction model output to produce forecasts of streamflow,"This paper examines an archive containing over 40 years of 8-day atmospheric forecasts over the contiguous United States from the NCEP reanalysis project to assess the possibilities for using medium-range numerical weather prediction model output for predictions of streamflow. This analysis shows the biases in the NCEP forecasts to be quite extreme. In many regions, systematic precipitation biases exceed 100% of the mean, with temperature biases exceeding 3degreesC. In some locations, biases are even higher. The accuracy of NCEP precipitation and 2-m maximum temperature forecasts is computed by interpolating the NCEP model output for each forecast day to the location of each station in the NWS cooperative network and computing the correlation with station observations. Results show that the accuracy of the NCEP forecasts is rather low in many areas of the country. Most apparent is the generally low skill in precipitation forecasts (particularly in July) and low skill in temperature forecasts in the western United States, the eastern seaboard, and the southern tier of states. These results outline a clear need for additional processing of the NCEP Medium-Range Forecast Model (MRF) output before it is used for hydrologic predictions. Techniques of model output statistics (MOS) are used in this paper to downscale the NCEP forecasts to station locations. Forecasted atmospheric variables (e.g., total column precipitable water, 2-m air temperature) are used as predictors in a forward screening multiple linear regression model to improve forecasts of precipitation and temperature for stations in the National Weather Service cooperative network. This procedure effectively removes all systematic biases in the raw NCEP precipitation and temperature forecasts. MOS guidance also results in substantial improvements in the accuracy of maximum and minimum temperature forecasts throughout the country. For precipitation, forecast improvements were less impressive. MOS guidance increases the accuracy of precipitation forecasts over the northeastern United States, but overall, the accuracy of MOS-based precipitation forecasts is slightly lower than the raw NCEP forecasts. Four basins in the United States were chosen as case studies to evaluate the value of MRF output for predictions of streamflow. Streamflow forecasts using MRF output were generated for one rainfall-dominated basin (Alapaha River at Statenville, Georgia) and three snowmelt-dominated basins (Animas River at Durango, Colorado; East Fork of the Carson River near Gardnerville, Nevada; and Cle Elum River near Roslyn, Washington). Hydrologic model output forced with measured-station data were used as truth'' to focus attention on the hydrologic effects of errors in the MRF forecasts. Eight-day streamflow forecasts produced using the MOS-corrected MRF output as input (MOS) were compared with those produced using the climatic Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique. MOS-based streamflow forecasts showed increased skill in the snowmelt-dominated river basins, where daily variations in streamflow are strongly forced by temperature. In contrast, the skill of MOS forecasts in the rainfall-dominated basin (the Alapaha River) were equivalent to the skill of the ESP forecasts. Further improvements in streamflow forecasts require more accurate local-scale forecasts of precipitation and temperature, more accurate specification of basin initial conditions, and more accurate model simulations of streamflow.",10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0015:UOMNWP>2.0.CO;2,"Clark, MP; Hay, LE",2004,Article,J.

10,,EVALUATION OF POTATO LATE BLIGHT FORECASTS MODIFIED TO INCLUDE WEATHER FORECASTS - A SIMULATION ANALYSIS,"The potential effect of incorporating weather forecasts into potato late blight disease forecasts for timing protectant fungicide applications was investigated. Fungicide applications, fungicide weathering, and pathogen development were simulated with a system of field-tested computer simulation models, using 50 yr of weather data from Steuben County, New York. Weather forecasts were simulated with a probability model that relates distributions of observed high relative humidity periods and mean temperature to forecasts produced by the National Meteorological Center. Simulated weather forecasts (with accuracy equivalent to those of real forecasts) improved the efficiency in the use of fungicide scheduled with BLITECAST: The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was decreased by about 5%, but the same number of fungicide sprays was used. The maximum contribution of a weather forecast was determined by using perfect knowledge of future weather 1 and 2 days in advance as the weather forecast. Such perfect knowledge of future weather used with BLITECAST or with a simulation-based disease forecast decreased AUDPC by about 8 or 10%, respectively. Finally, two additional sets of simulations were done with weather data modified to be less favorable to late blight. In these simulations, weather forecasts provided an increasing benefit as conditions for late blight development became less favorable.",10.1094/Phyto-83-103,"RAPOSO, R; WILKS, DS; FRY, WE",1993,Article,Phytopathology,English,abby lewis,"simulation, not real data",NA,1,0,,NA,,0,
11,,THRESHOLD RELATIVE-HUMIDITY DURATION FORECASTS FOR PLANT-DISEASE PREDICTION,"Duration of high relative humidity periods is an important component of many plant disease development models. Performance of forecasts of this quantity, based on the model output statistics 3-h temperature and dewpoint forecasts produced by the National Meteorological Center, is examined for selected locations. A probability model for high relative humidity duration conditional on these forecasts is presented, which succinctly describes forecast performance and would be straightforward to implement operationally. The forecast humidity duration intervals are relatively broad, but their transformation into probability forecasts of disease severity ratings, illustrated for the case of potato late blight, can produce good results.",10.1175/1520-0450(1991)030<0463:TRHDFF>2.0.CO;2,"WILKS, DS; SHEN, KW",1991,Article,J.

2,123,Development of a Oak Pollen Emission and Transport Modeling Framework in South Korea,"Pollen is closely related to health issues such as allergenic rhinitis and asthma as well as intensifying atopic syndrome. Information on current and future spatio-temporal distribution of allergenic pollen is needed to address such issues. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling (CMAQ) was utilized as a base modeling system to forecast pollen dispersal from oak trees. Pollen emission is one of the most important parts in the dispersal modeling system. Areal emission factor was determined from gridded areal fraction of oak trees, which was produced by the analysis of the tree type maps (1: 5000) obtained from the Korea Forest Service. Daily total pollen production was estimated by a robust multiple regression model of weather conditions and pollen concentration. Hourly emission factor was determined from wind speed and friction velocity. Hourly pollen emission was then calculated by multiplying areal emission factor, daily total pollen production, and hourly emission factor. Forecast data from the KMA UM LDAPS (Korea Meteorological Administration Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System) was utilized as input. For the verification of the model, daily observed pollen concentration from 12 sites in Korea during the pollen season of 2014. Although the model showed a tendency of over-estimation in terms of the seasonal and daily mean concentrations, overall concentration was similar to the observation. Comparison at the hourly output showed distinctive delay of the peak hours by the model at the 'Pocheon' site. It was speculated that the constant release of hourly number of pollen in the modeling framework caused the delay.",https://doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2015.25.2.221,"Lim, YK; Kim, KR; Cho, C; Kim, M; Choi, HS; Han, MJ; Oh, I; Kim, BJ",2015,Article,Atmos.-Korea,Korean,mary lofton,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,abby lewis,paper is in korean,1,
5,160,Improvement and Evaluation of Emission Formulas in UM-CMAQ-Pollen Model,"For the allergy patient who needs to know the situation about the extent of pollen risk, the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences developed a pollen forecasting system based on the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling (CMAQ). In the old system, pollen emission from the oak was estimated just based on the airborne concentration and meteorology factors, resulted in high uncertainty. For improving the quality of current pollen forecasting system, therefore the estimation of pollen emission is now corrected based on the observation of pollen emission at the oak forest to better reflect the real emission pattern. In this study, the performance of the previous (NIMS2014) and current (NIMS2016) model system was compared using observed oak pollen concentration. Daily pollen concentrations and emissions were simulated in pollen season 2016 and accuracy of onset and end of pollen season were evaluated. In the NIMS2014 model, pollen season was longer than actual pollen season; The simulated pollen season started 6 days earlier and finished 13.25 days later than the actual pollen season. The NIMS2016 model, however, the simulated pollen season started only 1.83 days later, and finished 0.25 days later than the actual pollen season, showing the improvement to predict the temporal range of pollen events. Also, the NIMS2016 model shows better performance for the prediction of pollen concentration, while there is a still large uncertainty to capture the maximum pollen concentration at the target site. Continuous efforts to correct these problems will be required in the future.",https://doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2019.29.1.001,"Kim, TH; Seo, YA; Kim, KR; Cho, C; Han, MJ",2019,Article,Atmos.-Korea,Korean,mary lofton,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,abby lewis,In korean,1,
