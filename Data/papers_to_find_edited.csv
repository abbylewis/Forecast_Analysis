47,The effects of management and precipitation on forage composition of a southern tallgrass prairie,"This study described how paddock management and precipitation patterns affected forage composition of a southern tallgrass prairie in 1984-1995, and examined regional 3-month total precipitation forecasts from 19952001 for their potential as a management tool. Forage composition varied during the study. Large changes occurred in 1988-89, due to a short dry period, and persisted through 1995. The dominant forage groups were correlated with precipitation during different quarters, which interacted with management to cause paddock differences. Experimental 3-month forecasts did not accurately predict precipitation of La Nina events during 1995-2001. If these forecasts could be improved, they would be useful tools for drought management.",NA,"Northup, BK; Schneider, JM; Daniel, JA",2002,Proceedings Paper,2686,heather wander,NA,1,0,NA,,dexter howard,Not forecasting an ecological variable,Full paper unavailable ,NA,English,1,0,,Got PDF

83,Factors affecting wild turkey recruitment in western Virginia,"Annual recruitment of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) should be closely monitored to regulate fall turkey seasons and reduce risk of over-harvest. However, previous studies have not encompassed the spatial or temporal scales needed to produce models that can consistently predict recruitment over a large region. Our objective was to assess the ability of using long-term data sets of sex-age ratios, oak (Quercus spp.) mast, and weather variables to forecast annual wild turkey recruitment in western Virginia. We conducted a thorough literature search on factors believed to be limiting reproduction and developed a series of 14 a priori models and I a posteriori model to predict recruitment. We used fall harvest ratios of juveniles per adult female, averaged over 26 western Virginia counties, during 1973-2002 as an index to annual recruitment and investigated the relationship of recruitment to age structure of the population, oak mast production in the previous fall, and spring weather. We considered impacts of different weather severity measures and investigated effects of deviation from mean, 90%, and 75% quartile values on recruitment. Our best model (omega(9) = 0.812) predicting recruitment incorporated May and June rainfall and March temperatures at the 75% quartile scale. This model accounted for a significant amount of variation in recruitment residuals (R-2 = 0.50, R-adj(2) = 0.44). Monitoring these selected weather parameters offers managers the ability to predict significant changes in recruitment annually.",NA,"Norman, GW; Fearer, TM; Devers, PK",2004,Proceedings Paper,2550,abby lewis,1,1,1,NA,I can't find the actual paper online,Whitney,,"yes, unavailable",NA,English,1,Got PDF 28 Jul 20,,Requested
157,Relative time NDVI mosaics as an indicator of crop growth,"Relative time NDVI mosaics are proposed as a tool for crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting. The mosaics are constructed for the region of interest for a given phenological phase of crop development (for example, flowering). Mosaics for different years, created for the same characteristic time of crop development, are used for crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting. The approach is illustrated through two case studies: - forecasting of wheat yield in the countries of Northern Africa (relative time NDVI mosaics are constructed for the flowering stage of crop development); - assessing winter crop status in southern areas of Russia after the winter season (mosaics are constructed two dekads before the establishment of snow cover and two dekads after its disappearance). NDVI values, calculated from SPOT4-Vegetation data, were used in both cases. Dates of crop phenological. phases were determined applying the WOFOST crop growth model and ECMWF-derived meteorological grid data. Results demonstrate the validity of the approach and the improvements obtained as compared with traditional methods.",https://doi.org/10.1117/12.463093,"Savin, IY; Negre, T",2003,Proceedings Paper,2651,abby lewis,NA,1,0,NA,,Whitney,Not a forecast,Abby found on 5 Jul 2020.

193,Inclusion of Synoptic Weather Forecast Data in Decision Support Systems for Agriculture,"Models for agricultural decision support inform grower management strategies with the goals of increasing product quality, limiting expenditures, and reducing the amount of chemical released to the environment. Plant disease risk systems are often used to estimate environmental conditions that are favourable for risk of disease epidemics and fungicide recommendations appropriate to that risk. Meteorological data has been included in these systems for well over 50 years. The inclusion of extended range synoptic forecast data into risk estimation models renders such systems even more valuable to growers by providing prediction of risk conditions up to several days in advance of their occurrence. This paper describes the development and implementation of a series of artificial neural network models to incorporate synoptic weather forecasts into an expert system for potato late blight risk. Potato late blight serves as an excellent test case for such models, as late blight risk systems have included weather variables since the 1960s. Previous attempts to use synoptic weather forecasts in plant pathology have had limited results because of the quality of forecast data. However, since 2003 the National Weather Service (NWS) of the United States has implemented new medium extended (MEX) forecast models that have improved their usefulness for plant pathology applications. The number of stations throughout the US with daily model output statistics (MOS) available publicly has also increased dramatically in recent years. Initial analysis of the new forecast MOS began in 2005. The twelve NWS stations with the longest MOS archive lengths for the state of Michigan were used to determine what the optimal modelling approach and average accuracy would be. Determinacy analysis, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks were each examined for their utility in predicting agricultural risk in potatoes from late blight. Model variables taken directly from and derived from the MOS data included spatial, temporal, and weather based variables. The models proved successful in predicting potato late blight risk as estimated by potato late blight disease severity values (DSV) up to four days in advance of their occurrence. Model results were significantly higher than predicting no risk every day, which would yield a state average accuracy of 72 percent. High and low risk periods, optimized as a function of the frequency of risk days through time in the growing season for each station, were significant in every type of model. The artificial neural network models achieved the highest overall accuracy (79 percent) and the highest accuracy in July and August when weather is particularly favourable for the disease in this region. In recent years, as longer data records of MOS have become available and additional station locations have been added to the network, it has become important to examine the usefulness of generalized state models, developed from regional locations with long archive records, at a more local scale. The south central region of Michigan was chosen for this analysis as ten prediction locations have been added in close proximity (within 70 km) of one of the first order stations (JXN). Lack of archive data for the newer stations is the main cause of concern when using the same modelling approach at a local level, especially with regard to station specific variables such as high and low risk time period. Preliminary analysis of the regional scale showed that station specific risk time periods resulted in lower accuracies than those derived from regional normals when archive records of only one year were available. In general, the artificial neural network model developed at the scale of the state did not appear be acceptable at the regional scale. Further research will focus on regional scale variables that may be used to increase the range of usefulness of such a model without requiring respecification for every station location individually.",NA,"Baker, KM; Kirk, WW; Wharton, P",2007,Proceedings Paper,2312,nick hammond,1,1,1,NA,,Whitney,Should include!

213,Management perspectives of the calcareous cyanobacterial build-ups in the hardwater rivers of Haute-Normandie (France),"Calcite precipitation on cyanobacterial benthic films is the cause of the cementing of many calcareous river beds in northwest France. The extent of this phenomenon depends both on the composition of the film and on how favourable the local conditions are to the encrusting microflora. The surveys carried out over the past 10 years have determined the thresholds at which the phenomenon appears and those allowing the most favourable development of the encrusting microflora (trophic conditions, temperature, exposure to light, grain size of the river bed, depth and speed of current). An assessment grid for the intensity of the phenomenon, which takes into account the determining factors, has been confirmed by on site measurements. As early as the spring, this grid makes it possible to forecast with a reasonable degree of error the precipitation rate for each site during the course of the coming year. It is also a useful tool for the management of the regular maintenance work carried out on the rivers affected by this phenomenon.",NA,"Pitois, F; Jigorel, A; Ferlin, P",2007,Proceedings Paper,2378,mary lofton,NA,1,0,NA,,abby lewis,Found.

270,"Water Quality Protection: Grand-Marina, Sochi","It's presented the method based on the numerical modeling of the processes for the forecasting and protecting of the sea water quality at the stage of design of the coastal constructions like the ports, recreation and shore protection. The enclosed coastal water bodies are the areas of the intensive pollution and in the same time have the limited water exchange with the main basin. The objective of the study is the development of the method of forecasting of the port water quality and recommendations on the required water quality supply. The protection of the water quality in the yachting ports is very actual problem because the water quality is not only environmental but also the consuming property of the marinas. The study has been carried out for the conditions of the yachting port ""Grand-Marina Sochi"", which is designed for placing in the sea port Sochi, Russian Black Sea coast. The capacity of marina is 300 yachts; the water area of marina is bounded by construction of the additional breakwater in the main sea port. The discharges of the oil, as well as the accidence at the sewage system are considered like the sources of the pollution. The numerical modeling of current pattern has been applied to forecast the spreading of the pollution under the determined hydrometeorological scenarios. 3D circulation of the currents inside and in the gate of the marina is modeled by application of the SELFE-code - the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations on the unstructured grids. To simulate the dynamics and evolution of the oil spill the 3D OILTOX-code is used. The both codes have been developed in Ukrainian Center of Ecological and Water Projects. The system dynamic model of the water quality evolution has been designed on the base of PowerSim program, and applied to simulate the changes of the water quality parameters after sewage system damage. Three meteorological scenarios with the wind velocity, 5, 10, and 15 m/s have been considered. It was shown that the currents have the 3D structure with the surface velocities following wind direction, and near-bottom velocities having the opposite direction. The oil spill dynamics simulated using the Lagrange approach, the total volume of the discharged oil is taking as 500 liters, the time of discharge is 10 minutes, the number of model Lagrange tracers is 6200. As the result, the time of reaching by the oil the coastline ( breakwater or port mole) has been obtained. That should be included to the planned measures of the water quality protection system. The analysis of the sources of pollution of the Sochi sea port resulted that the main source is the surface rain water discharge. That gives the main input of the organic matters to the sea water. The main mechanism of the cleaning of the water body is the water exchange between marina and the Black sea. It's shown the evolution of the water quality as the result of the chemical reactions and the flushing by water exchange. The results of the study apply for development the recommendation for program of the environmental monitoring of the sea water quality in the port basin at the stage of port operation.",NA,"Kantardgi, I; Maderich, V; Terletskaya, E; Brovchenko, I; Prokhoda-Shumskikh, L",2013,Proceedings Paper,1580,john smith,NA,1,0,NA,"im putting this as yes for question 3, but it was a water quality paper",Whitney,Not a forecast; hypothetical predictions,emailed author and received paper,NA,English,1,0,,Requested

Data corresponds to the colour of water of groundwater and drinking water of water intake of south-east region of the Republic of Belarus. The definition of colour was carried out for the period from 2009 to 2017. twice a day, the time series of values included 5215 values. The parameters of the models were estimated by 85% of the time series values, and the remaining 15% of the values (the test period) compared the forecast values with the actual ones. Optimal configurations of ARIMA-models were determined from the results of comparing the averaged values of the root mean squared errors (RMSE); optimal configurations of ANN were determined from the results of comparing the averaged values of RMSE and correlation coefficients (CC) on the test periods. Results. Comparison of forecasting methods was carried out on the basis of the averaged values of mean absolute error and mean relative error on the test periods. It was revealed that ANN allows to obtain the predicted values of colour of water more accurate than ARIMA-model. Main conclusions. Software implementation of ANN in the MATLAB environment empowers with sufficient accuracy get forecast values of groundwater and drinking water for 100 values.",https://doi.org/10.18470/1992-1098-2019-1-159-168,"Makarov, DV; Kantor, EA; Krasulina, NA; Greb, AV; Berezhnova, ZZ",2019,Article,325,abby lewis,NA,NA,NA,NA,,dexter howard,I have the pdf but it is in Russian,full paper only avialable in Russian,South Russ.-Ecol.
