Further, resource managers are often faced with knowing these broad-scale relationships as well as nuanced environmental factors related to their landscape that influence where an invasive species occurs and potentially could occur. Using invasive buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris), we developed global models and local models for Saguaro National Park, Arizona, USA, based on location records and literature on physiological tolerances to environmental factors to investigate whether environmental relationships of a species at a global scale are also important at local scales. In addition to correlative models with five commonly used algorithms, we also developed a model using a priori user-defined relationships between occurrence and environmental characteristics based on a literature review. All correlative models at both scales performed well based on statistical evaluations. The user-defined curves closely matched those produced by the correlative models, indicating that the correlative models may be capturing mechanisms driving the distribution of buffelgrass. Given climate projections for the region, both global and local models indicate that conditions at Saguaro National Park may become more suitable for buffelgrass.

This study used environmental niche models (ENMs) to map and compare potential present and future distributions of suitable environmental conditions for Marco Polo argali. Argali occurrence points were collected during field surveys conducted from 2009 to 2016. Our models showed that terrain ruggedness and annual mean temperature had strong correlations on argali distribution. We then used two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for two future time periods (2050 and 2070) to model the impacts of climate change on Marco Polo argali habitat. Results indicated a decline of suitable habitat with majority of losses observed at lower elevations (3,300-4,300m). Models that considered all variables (climatic and nonclimatic) predicted losses of present suitable areas of 60.6% (6,928km(2)) and 63.2% (7,219km(2)) by 2050 and 2070, respectively. Results also showed averaged habitat gains of 46.2% (6,106km(2)) at much higher elevations (4,500-6,900 m) and that elevational shifts of habitat use could occur in the future.

However, the environmental and anthropogenic factors facilitating invasion dynamics and their interactions are still largely unknown. This study compiles and inputs available data for the NIS bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis across the invaded biogeographic range in the Mediterranean basin into a species distribution model to predict future spread under a range of marine scenarios. Location: Mediterranean Sea. Methods: A systematic review produced the largest presence database ever assembled to inform the selection of biological, chemical and physical factors linked to the spread of B. pharaonis through the Suez Canal. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to simulate current and future trophic and salinity scenarios. A species distribution model was run to determine key drivers of invasion, quantify interactive impacts arising from a range of trophic states, salinity conditions and climatic scenarios and forecast future trajectories for the spread of NIS into new regions under multiple-parameter scenarios (based on the main factors identified from the systematic review). Results: Impacts on invasion trajectory arising from climate change and interactions with increasing salinity from the new opening of the canal were the primary drivers of expansion across the basin, the effects of which were further enhanced by eutrophication. Predictions of the current distribution were most accurate when multiple stressors were used to drive the model. A habitat suitability index developed at a subcontinental scale from model outputs identified novel favourable conditions for future colonization at specific locations under 2030 and 2050 climatic scenarios. Main conclusions: Future expansion of B. pharaonis will be enhanced by climate-facilitated increased sea temperature, interacting with increasing pressures from salinity and eutrophication. The spatially explicit risk output maps of invasions represent a powerful visual product for use in communication of the spread of NIS and decision-support tools for scientists and policymakers. The suggested approach, the observed distribution pattern and driving processes can be applied to other NIS species and regions by providing novel forecasts of species occurrences under future multiple stressor scenarios and the location of suitable recipient habitats with respect to anthropogenic and environmental parameters.",,,,"Porporato, Erika M.

The study is underpinned by multi-satellite measured AOD and ECMWF meteorological reanalysis fields. Linear trends in the period 1980-2014 indicate that AOD (dust) diminished slightly as rainfall and vegetation cover increased. Concommitant climatic trends include a weakening of Atlantic trade winds, acceleration of the easterly jet and inland penetration of the Guinea monsoon. Trends in temperature and winds strengthen above the boundary layer; suggesting that surface changes are damped by greening of the Sahel 1980-2014. Climatic conditions favoring dust emissions are evident in sensible heat flux, maximum temperature and upward motion at seasonal and daily time scales, with influence from wind vorticity at diurnal time scale.

This shift has the potential to affect the carbon cycling of peatland ecosystems, including the flux of methane from the peat. We conducted a field manipulation experiment where irrigation treatments were used to simulate different seasonal rainfall regimes. The treatments were designed such that total seasonal rainfall was held constant but discrete event frequency and magnitude were altered between treatments in a poor fen in southern Ontario, Canada. The rainfall regime was controlled over three vegetation types: Sphagnum capillifolium (moss); Carex oligoperma (sedge); and Chamaedaphne calyculata (shrub). Decreasing rainfall frequency from thrice-weekly to bi-monthly [ coupled with 6X increase in event intensity] led to significantly greater CH4 flux from the moss and sedge communities in the latter third of the growing season. The shrub communities were unaffected by the changing rainfall regime. A companion lab mesocosm experiment revealed the control the fluctuating water table had on the CH4 fluxes from the vegetation community, particularly from the moss communities. Overall, there were significantly greater CH4 fluxes from all communities with increasing days since the previous rainfall event. As precipitation frequency decreases results of this study demonstrate the potential for increased CH4 flux to the atmosphere from peatland areas dominated by Sphagnum and herbaceous species. Wetland restoration and creation projects should consider these effects on peatland carbon cycling and function. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These interactions make predictions of the ecological response to climate change challenging; however, predictive models are required to effectively manage wildlife populations and conserve biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate how agent-based models (ABMs) can be used to predict population responses under multiple effects of climate change. We consider the case of northern common eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis), a culturally and ecologically important seaduck which is experiencing dramatic environmental change due to losses in Arctic sea ice. Our model shows that losses in Arctic sea ice will lead to increases in nest predation by polar bears in areas where these species are sympatric. However, climate mediated increases in breeding propensity and clutch size could have a large positive effect on eider population size. When considered together, these effects are predicted to result in a relatively stable eider population size over a 50-year period. Additionally, assuming eider populations are influenced by climate change in the manner proposed in this study, our model suggests that future eider populations will not be more susceptible to extrinsic perturbations (e.g. severe weather events, disease outbreaks) than were historical populations. As a result, our study demonstrates increasing climatic suitability and increasing nest predation will not lead to major changes in population size in northern common eiders, and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple, interacting effects on wildlife populations experiencing climate change.",,,,,"Dey, Cody/0000-0003-4947-8972",Mitacs Accelerate Cluster grant [IT04216]; Liber Ero Fellowship; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Carleton University; University of Windsor; Weston Foundation; Nunavut Inuit Wildlife Secretariat; ArcticNet Centers of Excellence; Oceans North; Polar Continental Shelf ProjectNatural Resources Canada; PEW Charitable Trust,"The authors thank community members from Cape Dorset, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit, Kangiqsujuaq, Aupaluk, Kangirsuk, Ivujivik and Kimmirut, for logistical assistance with common eider field research.

Extreme climate events are also becoming more frequent and it is unknown how they will affect feedbacks of CO2 between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere. An improved understanding of species differences at the regional scale of the response of forest productivity to climate variation and extremes is thus important for forecasting forest dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the climate sensitivity of aboveground net primary production (NPP) simulated by two dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM; ORCHIDEE and LPJ-wsl) against tree ring width (TRW) observations from about 1000 sites distributed across Europe. In both the model simulations and the TRW observations, forests in northern Europe and the Alps respond positively to warmer spring and summer temperature, and their overall temperature sensitivity is larger than that of the soil-moisture-limited forests in central Europe and Mediterranean regions. Compared with TRW observations, simulated NPP from ORCHIDEE and LPJ-wsl appear to be overly-sensitive to climatic factors. Our results indicate that the models lack biological processes that control time lags, such as carbohydrate storage and remobilization, that delay the effects of radial growth dynamics to climate.

Increasingly severe droughts may be exacerbated both by warmer temperatures and by the relative unavailability of water that arrives in more sporadic and intense rainfall events. Using long-term data and an experimental water manipulation, we examined the resilience of a heterogeneous annual grassland community to a prolonged series of dry winters that led to a decline in plant species richness (2000-2014), followed by a near-record wet winter (2016-2017), a climatic sequence that broadly resembles the predicted future in its high variability. In our 80, 5-m(2) observational plots, species richness did not recover in response to the wet winter, and the positive relationship of richness to annual winter rainfall thus showed a significant weakening trend over the 18-year time period. In experiments on 100, 1-m(2) plots, wintertime water supplementation increased and drought shelters decreased the seedling survival and final individual biomass of native annual forbs, the main functional group contributing to the observed long-term decline in richness. Water supplementation also increased the total cover of native annual forbs, but only increased richness within nested subplots to which seeds were also added. We conclude that prolonged dry winters, by increasing seedling mortality and reducing growth of native forbs, may have diminished the seedbank and thus the recovery potential of diversity in this community. However, the wet winter and the watering treatment did cause recovery of the community mean values of a key functional trait (specific leaf area, an indicator of drought intolerance), suggesting that some aggregate community properties may be stabilized by functional redundancy among species.",,,,,,NSF Graduate FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF),NSF Graduate Fellowship,,,11,11,11,88,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

State-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) provide a general framework for forecasting landscape dynamics, including projections of both vegetation and landuse/land-cover (LULC) change. The STSM method divides a landscape into spatially referenced cells and then simulates the state of each cell forward in time, as a discrete-time stochastic process using a Monte Carlo approach, in response to any number of possible transitions. A current limitation of the STSM method, however, is that all of the state variables must be discrete. 2. Here we present a new approach for extending a STSM, in order to account for continuous state variables, called a STSM with stocks and flows (STSM-SF). The STSM-SF method allows for any number of continuous stocks to be defined for every spatial cell in the STSM, along with a suite of continuous flows specifying the rates at which stock levels change over time. The change in the level of each stock is then simulated forward in time, for each spatial cell, as a discrete-time stochastic process. The method differs from the traditional systems dynamics approach to stock-flow modelling in that the stocks and flows can be spatially explicit, and the flows can be expressed as a function of the STSM states and transitions. 3. We demonstrate the STSM-SF method by integrating a spatially explicit carbon (C) budget model with a STSM of LULC change for the state of Hawai'i, USA. In this example, continuous stocks are pools of terrestrial C, whereas the flows are the possible fluxes of C between these pools. Importantly, several of these C fluxes are triggered by corresponding LULC transitions in the STSM. Model outputs include changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of C pools and fluxes across the landscape in response to projected future changes in LULC over the next 50 years. 4. The new STSM-SF method allows both discrete and continuous state variables to be integrated into a STSM, including interactions between them. With the addition of stocks and flows, STSMs provide a conceptually simple yet powerful approach for characterizing uncertainties in projections of a wide range of questions regarding landscape change.",,,,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; Nature Conservancy; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; U.S. Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; LANDFIRE program; Apex Resource Management Solutions,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; The Nature Conservancy; U.S. Geological Survey; U.S. Forest Service; LANDFIRE program; Apex Resource Management Solutions,,,6,6,0,3,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Loss of pollinators in particular has major implications, with extirpation of these species potentially leading to severe losses in agriculture and, thus, economic losses. In this study, we forecast the effects of climate change on the distribution of hoverflies in Southeast Europe using species distribution modelling and climate change scenarios for two time-periods. For 2041-2060, 19 analysed species were predicted to increase their areas of occupancy, with the other 25 losing some of their ranges. For 2061-2080, 55% of species were predicted to increase their area of occupancy, while 45% were predicted to experience range decline. In general, range size changes for most species were below 20%, indicating a relatively high resilience of hoverflies to climate change when only environmental variables are considered. Additionally, range-restricted species are not predicted to lose more area proportionally to widespread species. Based on our results, two distributional trends can be established: the predicted gain of species in alpine regions, and future loss of species from lowland areas. Considering that the loss of pollinators from present lowland agricultural areas is predicted and that habitat degradation presents a threat to possible range expansion of hoverflies in the future, developing conservation management strategy for the preservation of these species is crucial. This study represents an important step towards the assessment of the effects of climate changes on hoverflies and can be a valuable asset in creating future conservation plan, thus helping in mitigating potential consequences.",,,,"Milicic, Marija/V-7392-2019; Vujic, Ante/AAG-2996-2020; Cardoso, Pedro/A-8820-2008","Milicic, Marija/0000-0002-3154-660X; Cardoso, Pedro/0000-0001-8119-9960; Vujic, Ante/0000-0002-8819-8079","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia [173002, 43002]; Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development [114-457-2173/2011-01]; H2020 Project ANTARES [664387]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia, under Grant Nos. 173002, 43002, Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development under Grant No. 114-457-2173/2011-01 and H2020 Project ANTARES under Grant No. 664387.

Therefore, seeking global carbon reduction solutions from the perspective of city has become a focus of decision-makers in charge of environmental protection. The carbon emission reduction potential in land management and spatial adjustment has become an important mean for achieving regional and global sustainable development. In this paper, we systematically review and synthesize four main aspects of urban carbon metabolism spatial analysis, namely: (1) advances in urban carbon metabolism, (2) carbon accounting based on land use and cover change, (3) spatial distribution of urban carbon metabolism and influencing factors, and (4) forecasting based on land use change (Land Use and Cover Change LUCC). In addition, we point out current deficiencies in the study of urban carbon metabolism, such as incomplete process analysis and lack of spatial display. Based on previous research, we propose a spatial analysis-centric outlook on urban carbon metabolism, including the following key approaches: (1) future researchers should simultaneously consider natural and socioeconomic components, as well as vertical (flows from land to atmosphere) and horizontal (flows among different land use types) carbon flows, to obtain a more complete picture of the entire urban carbon metabolism system; (2) carbon metabolic spatial mapping can be implemented in patches to better serve government's goals for optimal regulation and spatial planning; (3) researchers should refine current urban-scale research, also expanding it to the metropolitan (i.e., urban agglomeration) scale, to establish multi-scale, multi-level, and organic network structures, and study the spatial distribution pattern of carbon metabolism within and among cities and metropolitan areas, which will lay a scientific foundation for urban, regional, and national sustainable development.",,,,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0503005]; Fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51721093]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571521]; Funds for International Cooperation and Exchanges of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51661125010]; Interdiscipline Research Funds of Beijing Normal University,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2016YFC0503005), by the Fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51721093), by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41571521), by Funds for International Cooperation and Exchanges of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51661125010), and by the Interdiscipline Research Funds of Beijing Normal University.",,,6,6,12,69,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Among these, the silver-cheeked toad-fish Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789) has rapidly colonised the eastern Mediterranean basin and is currently moving westwards. This pufferfish has a highly opportunistic behaviour, it attacks fish captured in nets and lines and seriously damages fishing gears and catch. It is a highly-toxic species with no immediate economic value for the Mediterranean market, although it currently represents 4% of the weight of the total artisanal catches. Consequently, the possible effects on Mediterranean fisheries and health require to enhance our understanding about the future geographical distribution of this pufferfish in the whole basin. In this paper, an overall habitat suitability map and an effective geographical spread map for L. sceleratus at Mediterranean scale are produced by using cloud computing-based algorithms to merge seven machine learning approaches. Further, the potential impact of the species is estimated for several Mediterranean Sea subdivisions: The major fishing areas of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Economic Exclusive Zones, and the subdivisions of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Sea. Our results suggest that without an intervention, L. sceleratus will continue its rapid spread and will likely have a high impact on fisheries.

Although the potential impacts of each threat have been widely studied in isolation, few studies have assessed the impacts of climate and land cover change in combination. Here, we evaluate the exposure of a large mammalian clade, bats, to multiple scenarios of environmental change and dispersal to understand potential consequences for biodiversity conservation. Location: Mexico. Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to forecast changes in environmental suitability for 130 bat species that occur in Mexico by 2050s under four dispersal assumptions and four combined climate and land use change scenarios. We identified regions with the strongest projected impacts for each scenario and assessed the overlap across scenarios. Results: The combined effects of climate and land use change will cause an average reduction in environmental suitability for 51% of the species across their range, regardless of scenario. Overall, species show a mean decrease in environmental suitability in at least 46% of their current range in all scenarios of change and dispersal. Climate scenarios had a higher impact on species environmental suitability than land use scenarios. There was a spatial overlap of 43% across the four environmental change scenarios for the regions projected to have the strongest impacts. Main conclusions: Combined effects of future environmental change may result in substantial declines in environmental suitability for Mexican bats even under optimistic scenarios. This study highlights the vulnerability of megadiverse regions and an indicator taxon to human disturbance.

The present research predicted future distributions of warm-adapted evergreen trees, Neolitsea sericea (Blume) Koidz. and Camellia japonica L., under climate change in the Korean Peninsula (KP) using an ensemble approach and quantified the predictive uncertainty. For these purposes, we used nine modeling algorithms and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method in modelling the current distributions of those evergreen trees; furthermore, we predicted their future distributions under 20 climate change scenarios and averaged the future predictions for ensemble forecasts. The results suggest that both species would expand to the northern part of KP under climate changes; however, the spatial pattern and rate of expansions would be different. C. japonica showed a faster expansion than N. sericea. While C. japonica showed both inland and northward expansions under climate change, N. sericea was mostly distributed in coastal areas. In addition, the highly suitable habitats of N. sericea and C. japonica will decline or shift to the north under climate change. This may indicate that climate change will degrade habitat suitability of those species within the distribution boundary and may restrict their continuous range expansions under further climate changes.

Stream and river ecosystems are inherently hierarchical, potentially resulting in organismal responses to fine-scale changes in patch characteristics that are conditional on the watershed context. Here, we address how populations of two salamander species are affected by interactions among hierarchical processes operating at different scales within a rapidly changing landscape of the southern Appalachian Mountains. We modeled reach-level occupancy of larval and adult black-bellied salamanders (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) and larval Blue Ridge two-lined salamanders (Eurycea wilderae) as a function of 17 different terrestrial and aquatic predictor variables that varied in spatial extent. We found that salamander occurrence varied widely among streams within fully forested catchments, but also exhibited species-specific responses to changes in local conditions. While D. quadramaculatus declined predictably in relation to losses in forest cover, larval occupancy exhibited the strongest negative response to forest loss as well as decreases in elevation. Conversely, occupancy of E. wilderae was unassociated with watershed conditions, only responding negatively to higher proportions of fast-flowing stream habitat types. Evaluation of hierarchical relationships demonstrated that most fine-scale variables were closely correlated with broad watershed-scale variables, suggesting that local reach-scale factors have relatively smaller effects within the context of the larger landscape. Our results imply that effective management of southern Appalachian stream salamanders must first focus on the larger scale condition of watersheds before management of local-scale conditions should proceed. Our findings confirm the results of some studies while refuting the results of others, which may indicate that prescriptive recommendations for range-wide management of species or the application of a single management focus across large geographic areas is inappropriate.",,,,,"Jackson, C.

The relative importance of such dynamics under climate change is, however, undetermined because direct tests comparing the performance of demographic models vs. simpler ecological niche models are still lacking owing to difficulties in evaluating forecasts using real-world data. We provide the first comparison of the skill of coupled ecological-niche-population models and ecological niche models in predicting documented shifts in the ranges of 20 British breeding bird species across a 40-year period. Forecasts from models calibrated with data centred on 1970 were evaluated using data centred on 2010. We found that more complex coupled ecological-niche-population models (that account for dispersal and metapopulation dynamics) tend to have higher predictive accuracy in forecasting species range shifts than structurally simpler models that only account for variation in climate. However, these better forecasts are achieved only if ecological responses to climate change are simulated without static snapshots of historic land use, taken at a single point in time. In contrast, including both static land use and dynamic climate variables in simpler ecological niche models improve forecasts of observed range shifts. Despite being less skilful at predicting range changes at the grid-cell level, ecological niche models do as well, or better, than more complex models at predicting the magnitude of relative change in range size. Therefore, ecological niche models can provide a reasonable first approximation of the magnitude of species' potential range shifts, especially when more detailed data are lacking on dispersal dynamics, demographic processes underpinning population performance, and change in land cover.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Brown, Stuart/AAC-7472-2020; Fordham, Damien/E-9255-2013","Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Brown, Stuart/0000-0002-0669-1418; Fordham, Damien/0000-0003-2137-5592; Neto, Dora/0000-0002-6234-6117; Bertelsmeier, Cleo/0000-0003-3624-1300","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT140101192, DP1096427, FT100100200]; Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/AAG-MAA/3764/2014]","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: FT140101192, DP1096427, FT100100200; Foundation for Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: PTDC/AAG-MAA/3764/2014",,,22,22,3,47,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Knowledge of the link between a vector population's pathogen-transmission potential and its biotic environment can generate more realistic forecasts of disease risk due to environmental change. It also can promote more effective vector control by both conventional and novel means. 2. This study assessed the effect of particular plant species assemblages differing in nectar production on components of the vectorial capacity of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae s.s., an important vector of African malaria. 3. We followed cohorts of mosquitoes for 3 weeks in greenhouse mesocosms holding nectar-poor and nectar-rich plant species by tracking daily mortalities and estimating daily biting rates and fecundities. At death, a mosquito's insemination status and wing length were determined. These life-history traits allowed incorporation of larval dynamics into a vectorial capacity estimate. This new study provided both novel assemblages of putative host plants and a human blood host within a nocturnal period of maximum biting. 4. Survivorship was significantly greater in nectar-rich environments than nectar-poor ones, resulting in greater total fecundity. Daily biting rate and fecundity per female between treatments was not detected. These results translated to greater estimated vectorial capacities in the nectar-rich environment in all four replicates of the experiment (means: 1,089.5 +/- 125.2 vs. 518.3 +/- 60.6). When mosquito density was made a function of survival and fecundity, rather than held constant, the difference between plant treatments was more pronounced, but so was the variance, so differences were not statistically significant. In the nectar-poor environment, females' survival suffered severely when a blood host was not provided. A sugar-accessibility experiment confirmed that Parthenium hysterophorus is a nectar-poor plant for these mosquitoes. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study, assessing the effect of particular plant species assemblages on the vectorial capacity of malaria mosquitoes, highlights the likelihood that changes in plant communities (e.g. due to introduction of exotic or nectar-rich species) can increase malaria transmission and that a reduction of favourable nectar sources can reduce it. Also, plant communities' data can be used to identify potential high risk areas. Further studies are warranted to explore how and when management of plant species assemblages should be considered as an option in an integrated vector management strategy.",,,,,,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01-AI077722]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-AI077722]; National Institute of Allergy & Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID),"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Grant/Award Number: R01-AI077722; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01-AI077722; National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases",,,3,3,4,27,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The proximate environmental cues that synchronize these general flowering events have not been evaluated systematically because there have been no long-term, high temporal resolution, species-level records from the region. We present 13 years of weekly flowering records for five Shorea species as well as daily temperature and rainfall records from the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. We constructed models to evaluate hypothesized relationships between flowering and cool temperature, drought, and additive and synergistic effects of cool temperature and drought for each species. Model parameters include periods of time for floral cue accumulation and flower development and temperature and/or rainfall thresholds required for floral initiation. Parameters estimated using flowering observations from 2001 to 2011 were used to forecast flowering for 2011-2014. We show that drought and cool temperatures acting synergistically best explain the timing of flowering events for all Shorea species in the section Mutica and forecast the largest general flowering event accurately. Periods estimated for signal accumulation ranged from 54 to 90 days among species. Periods estimated for flowers to develop ranged between 43 and 96 days and closely followed the interspecific sequence of flowering in the Shorea species. Drought and temperature thresholds also varied among species, with Shorea maxwelliana requiring the most severe drought and Shorea leprosula the lowest temperatures. Synthesis. Our results indicate that cool temperatures and low rainfall occurring on seasonal time-scales of about 2-3 months rather than brief cold snaps or brief droughts best explain general flowering in Shorea species at the Pasoh Forest Reserve. Low rainfall is equally likely in winter (December-February) and summer (July-August) and cool temperatures are most likely in winter at Pasoh, which explains why general flowering events are restricted to spring and fall, with more frequent and stronger flowering in spring. In addition, species-specific sensitivity to environmental cues suggests that future climate change will have differential impacts on the frequency of reproduction, with potential consequences for regeneration of these dominant species of lowland tropical forests.",,,,"Wright, Stuart Joseph/M-3311-2013","Wright, Stuart Joseph/0000-0003-4260-5676; Sun, I-Fang/0000-0001-9749-8324; Satake, Akiko/0000-0002-0831-8617; Tani, Makoto/0000-0001-8458-8638","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0108388]; Smithsonian Tropical Research instituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; CTFS-ForestGEO; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26251042]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-0108388, 2001-2006; Smithsonian Tropical Research institute, 2008-2010; CTFS-ForestGEO, 2007, 2012-2015; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 26251042",,,16,18,2,39,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Constraints on movement interact in complex ways with the physiology of the animal (metabolism) and physical environment (food and weather), but can be modelled using physical principles of energy and mass exchange. Here, we describe a general, spatially explicit individual-based movement model that couples a nutritional energy and mass budget model (dynamic energy budget theory) with a biophysical model of heat exchange. This provides a highly integrated method for constraining an ectothermic animal's movement in response to how food and microclimates vary in space and time. The model uses r to drive a NetLogo individual-based model together with microclimate and energy- and mass-budget modelling functions from the r package NicheMapR. It explicitly incorporates physiological and morphological traits, behavioural thermoregulation, movement strategies and movement costs. From this, the model generates activity budgets of foraging and shade-seeking, home range behaviour, spatial movement patterns and life history consequences under user-defined configurations of food and microclimates. To illustrate the model, we run simulations of the Australian sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa under different movement strategies (optimising or satisficing) in two contrasting habitats of varying food and shade (sparse and dense). We then compare the results with real, fine-scale movement data of a wild population throughout the breeding season. Our results show that (1) the extremes of movement behaviour observed in sleepy lizards are consistent with feeding requirements (passive movement) and thermal constraints (active movement), (2) the model realistically captures majority of the distribution of observed home range size, (3) both satisficing and optimising movement strategies appear to exist in the wild population, but home range size more closely approximates an optimising strategy, and (4) satisficing was more energetically efficient than optimising movement, which returned no additional benefit in metabolic fitness outputs. This framework for predicting physical constraints to individual movement can be extended to individual-level interactions with the same or different species and provides new capabilities for forecasting future responses to novel resource and weather scenarios.",,,,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Malishev, Matthew/0000-0002-8507-4433","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140101240, DP110102813, DP0877384]","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP0877384, DP110102813 and DP140101240",,,13,13,9,64,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Classical approaches to map how population of trees changed through space and time largely rely on pollen distribution patterns, with only a limited number of studies exploiting DNA molecules preserved in wooden tree archaeological and subfossil remains. Here, we advance such analyses by applying high-throughput (HTS) DNA sequencing to wood archaeological and subfossil material for the first time, using a comprehensive sample of 167 European white oak waterlogged remains spanning a large temporal (from 550 to 9,800 years) and geographical range across Europe. The successful characterization of the endogenous DNA and exogenous microbial DNA of 140 (similar to 83%) samples helped the identification of environmental conditions favouring long-term DNA preservation in wood remains, and started to unveil the first trends in the DNA decay process in wood material. Additionally, the maternally inherited chloroplast haplotypes of 21 samples from three periods of forest human-induced use (Neolithic, Bronze Age and Middle Ages) were found to be consistent with those of modern populations growing in the same geographic areas.

Forecasting the effects of actions to mitigate threats is hampered by incomplete information on species' responses. We develop an approach to predict community restructuring under threat management, which combines models of responses to threats with network analyses of species co-occurrence. We discover that contributions by species to network co-occurrence predict their recovery under reduction of multiple threats. Highly connected species are likely to benefit more from threat management than poorly connected species. Importantly, we show that information from a few species on co-occurrence and expected responses to alternative threat management actions can be used to train a response model for an entire community. We use a unique management data-set for a threatened bird community to validate our predictions and, in doing so, demonstrate positive feedbacks in occurrence and co-occurrence resulting from shared threat management responses during ecosystem recovery.",,,,"Tulloch, Ayesha/E-4408-2012; Chades, iadine/A-4052-2011; Lindenmayer, David B./P-7183-2017","Tulloch, Ayesha/0000-0002-5866-1923; Chades, iadine/0000-0002-7442-2850; Lindenmayer, David B./0000-0002-4766-4088",ARC Laureate FellowshipAustralian Research Council; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED)Australian Research Council,"D.B.L. is supported by an ARC Laureate Fellowship.

Evaluations of model performance (skill) against drifters showed improvement using Elasto-Brittle instead of Elastic-Viscous-Plastic rheology. However, model skill was degraded by time-averaging of ocean and ice model vectors before input to the oil spill model.

We show that the development and position of AC12 were better predicted in forecasts initialized on and after 4 August 2012. In addition, the position of AC12 was more predictable than its development. A comparison of ensemble members, classified by the error in predictability of the development and position of AC12, revealed that an accurate prediction of upper-level fields, particularly temperature, was important for the prediction of this event. The predicted position of AC12 was influenced mainly by the prediction of the polar vortex, whereas the predicted development of AC12 was dependent primarily on the prediction of the merging of upper-level warm cores. Consequently, an accurate prediction of the polar vortex position and the development of the warm core through merging resulted in better prediction of AC12.",,,,"Yamagami, Akio/W-7801-2019","Matsueda, Mio/0000-0001-8913-1303",Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project,This study was supported by the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project.,,,5,5,0,6,,,,1873-9652,1876-4428,,POLAR SCI,Polar Sci.,MAR,2018,15,,,,,,13,23,,10.1016/j.polar.2018.01.002,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000427579100002,,,,,

Previous work in aquatic ecosystems has used climate data at large scales and chemistry data at small scales; the consequence of using these different data types has not been evaluated. This study combines a survey of macrophyte diversity and water chemistry measurements at a large regional scale to demonstrate the feasibility and necessity of including ecological measurements, in addition to climate data, in species distribution models of aquatic macrophytes. A survey of 740 water bodies stratified across 327,000 square kilometers was conducted to document Characeae (green macroalgae) species occurrence and water chemistry data. Chemistry variables and climate data were used separately and in concert to develop species distribution models for ten species across the study area. The impacts of future environmental changes on species distributions were modeled using a range of global climate models (GCMs), representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and pollution scenarios. Models developed with chemistry variables generally gave the most accurate predictions of species distributions when compared with those using climate variables. Calcium and conductivity had the highest total relative contribution to models across all species. Habitat changes were most pronounced in scenarios with increased road salt and deicer influences, with two species predicted to increase in range by >50% and four species predicted to decrease in range by >50%. Species of Characeae have distinct habitat ranges that closely follow spatial patterns of water chemistry. Species distribution models built with climate data alone were insufficient to predict changes in distributions in the study area. The development and implementation of standardized, large-scale water chemistry databases will aid predictions of habitat changes for aquatic ecosystems.",,,,,,"Northeast Algal Society; Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society; International Phycological Society; Phycological Society of America; Sarah K.

Reliance on rangelands is projected to grow, thus understanding the sensitivity of rangelands to future climates is essential. We used a new ecosystem model of moderate complexity that allows, for the first time, to quantify global changes expected in rangelands under future climates. The mean global annual net primary production (NPP) may decline by 10 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2050 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, but herbaceous NPP is projected to increase slightly (i.e., average of 3 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Responses vary substantially from place-to-place, with large increases in annual productivity projected in northern regions (e.g., a 21% increase in productivity in the US and Canada) and large declines in western Africa (-46% in sub-Saharan western Africa) and Australia (-17%). Soil organic carbon is projected to increase in Australia (9%), the Middle East (14%), and central Asia (16%) and decline in many African savannas (e.g., -18% in sub-Saharan western Africa). Livestock are projected to decline 7.5 to 9.6%, an economic loss of from $9.7 to $12.6 billion. Our results suggest that forage production in Africa is sensitive to changes in climate, which will have substantial impacts on the livelihoods of the more than 180 million people who raise livestock on those rangelands. Our approach and the simulation tool presented here offer considerable potential for forecasting future conditions, highlight regions of concern, and support analyses where costs and benefits of adaptations and policies may be quantified.

Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) represents one such species in need of large-scale habitat restoration. It is a federally threatened sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligate bird with a limited range in Colorado and Utah. Threats to recovery of Gunnison sage-grouse include conifer expansion into sagebrush along with additional habitat loss and degradation attributed to human development and agricultural conversion. Recovery of Gunnison sage-grouse and other sensitive species can be aided by spatial tools that forecast plausible outcomes of conservation actions. We illustrate this by using a novel framework for predicting outcomes of proactive tree removal and subsequent sagebrush restoration for the Gunnison sage-grouse. To assess threats on Gunnison sage-grouse lek presence, we developed a spatially explicit breeding habitat model to compare active lek and random pseudo-absence locations from 2015. Models identified land cover, climatic, and abiotic variables at landscape-level scales (0.56 and 4 km) most important for predicting breeding habitat. Our model correctly differentiated between lek and pseudo-absence locations 94% of the time. All but one of the active leks (n = 94) were in areas with >0.65 probability of lek occurrence. Using this probability value as a threshold, we predicted 15% of the current grouse range as high-quality breeding habitat. Simulated removal of trees in areas with <= 30% tree canopy cover (0.56-km scale) increased extent of high-quality habitat fourfold (59%). Hypothetical restoration of sagebrush cover in the same areas increased habitat quality an additional 11%. Our breeding habitat model indicated that targeted tree removal and sagebrush restoration have potential to improve Gunnison sage-grouse breeding habitat. While our habitat treatment scenarios were not meant to be prescriptive, they highlight that considerable uplift in Gunnison sage-grouse breeding habitat may be possible across much of its range with cooperation from multiple stakeholders and illustrates the utility of this approach for predicting biological return on investment.",,,,,,Bureau of Land Management; Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies,"We thank the interagency Sagebrush Management Resilience and Resistance Tool committee for providing the impetus for creating range-wide Gunnison sage-grouse habitat models to overlay with the new Resiliency and Resistance tools developed for Gunnison sage-grouse and the eastern portion of the Greater sage-grouse range (Chambers et al. 2016).

However, discussions surrounding the appropriate designs of spatial management have largely been conceptual. This paper develops a spatial econometric model of fishing location choice using non-confidential data from the Great Barrier Reef coral trout commercial fishery. Harvest location decisions are modeled as a function of spatial patterns of expected economic returns. The preferred spatially dependent econometric model is shown to outperform ordinary least squares and fixed effects models in out-of-sample forecasting. Estimates from the spatial model reveal spatial spillover effects in fleet harvest location behavior. In particular, harvest activity at any given site is equally sensitive to same-site economic returns and surrounding-site economic returns. The econometric results are illustrated using a fee-based policy simulation. Results suggest non spatial management is characterized by two inefficiencies. First, heterogeneity between sites is averaged, resulting a fee that is too high or too low across space. Second, fees that are too high or too low affect the fishing effort in nearby locations.",,,,,,National Science Foundation Division of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0801430]; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT,"Research funding was provided by National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education #0801430, the Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT.

Location: North America. Methods: In order to estimate changes in the magnitude of risk across geography and across different species in the aquarium pathway, we considered an integrated approach to modelling the probability of establishment, which simultaneously included proxies of propagule pressure, environmental variables, species traits and interactions between environment and traits. We then used the parameters of our model to predict how the risk of establishment will change under a scenario of climate change forecast for the year 2050. Results: Our joint model performed better than submodels, suggesting that combining all components is worthwhile. The most predictive factors were precipitation, maximum temperature tolerance, maximum fish length and minimum temperature. Our joint model forecasted a 40% increase in the average risk of establishment by 2050 in the United States. In contrast to our expectations, the absolute establishment risk associated with this pathway remained very low for the entire suite of species in the aquarium trade in northern regions, such as Quebec, Canada. Instead, Florida, which has one of the highest current risks of establishment, was also forecasted to have the greatest absolute risk increase. Main conclusions: Our methodology for risk assessment allows invasive species management strategies to consider entire suites of species at a time and to forecast establishment risk for each species and location. While the aquarium pathway is likely to become more important for the United States, the Quebec government should prioritize other pathways of introduction in its exotic invasive species strategy. Our approach can be extended to be applied to different sets of species pertaining to the same or different pathways.",,,,,"Della Venezia, Lidia/0000-0001-7730-9362",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,,,5,5,0,34,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Genetic evidence for the few species tested, however, has indicated that some species survived glaciation in the NW Atlantic. Owing to the significant amount of data currently available, we sought to determine if COI-5P (5' end of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) could distinguish between populations surviving glaciation on both sides of the Atlantic versus postglacial recolonization. COI-5P results were consistent with published findings using other markers in Chondrus crispus, Mastocarpus stellatus, Palmaria palmata, and Saccharina latissima. Having success, we then analyzed molecular data for several species of red and brown macroalgae to date isolation times between NE and NW Atlantic populations and determine what percentage of species survived in NW Atlantic refugia. We generated and gathered genetic data from COI-5P in 1560 specimens representing 20 amphi-Atlantic species, and estimated isolation times between NE and NW populations using calibrated red and brown COI-5P clocks in IMa2. Of the species surveyed, 60% had isolation time estimates between NE and NW Atlantic populations predating the Last Glacial Maximum. Recent shared ancestry was inferred in the remaining cases. Our results indicate that local refugia and/or trans-Arctic migration from the Pacific are the source populations for the majority of the NW Atlantic macroalgal flora.

Characterizing sublethal effects of hypoxia exposure requires the ability to differentiate between exposed, and non-exposed individuals. Moreover, because sublethal effects may manifest well after exposure to hypoxia has ceased, long-term markers that facilitate retrospective identification of exposure are necessary. We used sagittal otoliths from 337 Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus sampled at multiple stations in the northern Gulf of Mexico to characterize exposure to hypoxia during the first year of life. Otolith elemental profiles of Ba:Ca and Mn:Ca revealed 4 primary clusters of fish associated with residence in normoxic, hypoxic, and estuarine habitats. Croaker exposed to hypoxia in the first year of life constituted 34% of all individuals sampled in fall of 2014, and this pattern was consistent across the sampling region. Young-of-year croaker exposed to hypoxia were smaller in length and mass but had similar mean relative condition factors to croaker of the same year class experiencing normoxic conditions.

The amount of uncertainty generated by the different components of this framework has rarely been assessed. In the marine realm forecasts have usually focused on taxa representing the top of the marine food-web, thus overlooking their basal component: the plankton. Calibrating environmental niche models at the global scale, we modelled the habitat suitability of 106 copepod species and estimated the dissimilarity between present and future zooplanktonic assemblages in the surface Mediterranean Sea. We identified the patterns (species replacement versus nestedness) driving the predicted dissimilarity, and quantified the relative contributions of different uncertainty sources: environmental niche models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, circulation model configurations and species prevalence. Our results confirm that the choice of the niche modelling method is the greatest source of uncertainty in habitat suitability projections. Presence-only and presence-absence methods provided different visions of the niches, which subsequently lead to different future scenarios of biodiversity changes. Nestedness with decline in species richness is the pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future copepod assemblages.

We examined the potential for climate and forest cover to limit the movement of bird species among sites of biodiversity importance in the Albertine Rift, East Africa, a biodiversity hotspot. We forecasted future distributions of suitable climate for 12 Albertine Rift endemic bird species using species distribution models based on current climate data and projections of future climate. We used these forecasts alongside contemporary forest cover and natal dispersal estimates to project potential movement of species over time. We identified potentially important pathways for the bird species to move among 30 important bird and biodiversity areas (IBAs) that are both currently forested and projected to provide suitable climate over intervening time periods. We examined the relative constraints imposed by availability of suitable climate and forest cover on future movements. The analyses highlighted important pathways of potential dispersal lying along a north-south axis through high elevation areas of the Albertine Rift. Both forest availability and climate suitability were projected to influence bird movement through these landscapes as they are affected by future climate change. Importantly, forest cover and areas projected to contain suitable climate in future were often dissociated in space, which could limit species' responses to climate change. A lack of climatically suitable areas was a far greater impediment to projected movement among IBAs than insufficient forest cover. Although current forest cover appears sufficient to facilitate movement of bird species in this region, protecting the remaining forests in areas also projected to be climatically suitable for species to move through in the future should be a priority for adaptation management.",,,,"Hole, David/Q-1692-2019; Bagchi, Robert/F-1732-2011; Butchart, Stuart/Y-2711-2018; Plumptre, Andrew J./X-3145-2019","Bagchi, Robert/0000-0003-4035-4105; Plumptre, Andrew J./0000-0002-9333-4047","John D. and Catherine T.

An appropriate level of process description is crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the available data and understanding of ecological structures. Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to predict ecological systems' responses to management.

However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three types of lag: ""dispersal lags"" affecting plant species' spread along elevational gradients, ""establishment lags"" following their arrival in recipient communities, and ""extinction lags"" of resident species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment. Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities might lag behind simple expectations based on species' range shifts with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming. Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation of mountain species and the ecosystem functions they provide.",,,,"Lenoir, Jonathan/AAE-8441-2019; Nunez, Martin A./AAF-1655-2019; Milbau, Ann/AAF-3022-2020; Pauchard, Anibal/B-5034-2008; Burgess, Treena I/G-4770-2011; Alexander, Jake/P-2580-2014; Haider, Sylvia/M-2990-2014; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020; Chalmandrier, Loic/H-8123-2019; Kueffer, Christoph/H-6091-2013; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Lenoir, Jonathan/0000-0003-0638-9582; Pauchard, Anibal/0000-0003-1284-3163; Burgess, Treena I/0000-0002-7962-219X; Alexander, Jake/0000-0003-2226-7913; Haider, Sylvia/0000-0002-2966-0534; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Milbau, Ann/0000-0003-3555-8883; Kueffer, Christoph/0000-0001-6701-0703; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731; Nunez, Martin/0000-0003-0324-5479",H2020 European Research Council [678841]; Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas [P05-002]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PFB-23]; National Science Foundation Dimensions of BiodiversityNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [NSF-1136703]; Carlsbergfondet (Carlsberg Foundation's Semper Ardens program); National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [MONB00363]; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2096-B16],"H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 678841; Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas, Grant/Award Number: P05-002; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: PFB-23; National Science Foundation Dimensions of Biodiversity, Grant/Award Number: NSF-1136703; Carlsbergfondet, Grant/Award Number: Carlsberg Foundation's Semper Ardens program; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: MONB00363; Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: I2096-B16",,,45,45,29,174,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

When coupled with projected climate change, these conditions have the potential to lead to vegetation type change and altered carbon (C) dynamics. In the Sierra Nevada, fuels reduction approaches that include mechanical thinning followed by regular prescribed fire are one approach to restore the ability of the ecosystem to tolerate episodic fire and still sequester C. Yet, the spatial extent of the area requiring treatment makes widespread treatment implementation unlikely. We sought to determine if a priori knowledge of where uncharacteristic wildfire is most probable could be used to optimize the placement of fuels treatments in a Sierra Nevada watershed. We developed two treatment placement strategies: the naive strategy, based on treating all operationally available area and the optimized strategy, which only treated areas where crown-killing fires were most probable. We ran forecast simulations using projected climate data through 2,100 to determine how the treatments differed in terms of C sequestration, fire severity, and C emissions relative to a no-management scenario. We found that in both the short (20 years) and long (100 years) term, both management scenarios increased C stability, reduced burn severity, and consequently emitted less C as a result of wildfires than no-management. Across all metrics, both scenarios performed the same, but the optimized treatment required significantly less C removal (naive=0.42 Tg C, optimized=0.25 Tg C) to achieve the same treatment efficacy. Given the extent of western forests in need of fire restoration, efficiently allocating treatments is a critical task if we are going to restore adaptive capacity in frequent-fire forests.",,,,"Hurteau, Matthew D/D-2301-2009; Scheller, Robert M/B-3135-2009","Hurteau, Matthew D/0000-0001-8457-8974; Scheller, Robert M/0000-0002-7507-4499",Joint Fire Science Program [14-1-01-2],"Joint Fire Science Program, Grant/Award Number: 14-1-01-2",,,17,17,2,32,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The ability to provide reliable projections for the current and future distribution of land-cover is fundamental if we wish to protect and manage our diminishing natural resources. Two inter-related revolutions make map productions feasible at unprecedented resolutions-the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data and the development of machine-learning algorithms. However, ground-truthed data needed for training models is in most cases spatially and temporally clustered. Therefore, map production requires extrapolation of models from one place to another and the uncertainty cost of such extrapolation is rarely explored. In other words, the focus has mainly been on projections, and less on quantifying their reliability. 2. Using the concept of ""forecast horizon"", we suggest that the predictability of land-cover classification models should be quantitatively explored as a continuum against distances measured along multiple dimensions-space, time, environmental and spectral. Focusing on ten agricultural sites from England and using models specifically designed to predict multivariate decay-curves, we ask: how does a model's predictive performance decay with distance? More specifically, we explored if we could predict the proficiency (kappa statistics) of a model trained in one site when making predictions in another site based on the spatial, temporal, spectral and environmental distances between sites. 3. We found that model proficiency decays with distance between sites in each dimension. More importantly, we found for the first time, that it is possible to predict the performance a model transferred to or from a novel site will have, based on its distances from known sites. The spectral distance variables were the most important when predicting model transferability. 4. Exploring model transferability as a continuum may have multiple usages including predicting uncertainty values in space and time, prioritisation of strategies for ground-truth data collection, and optimising model characteristics for defined tasks.",,,,"Gavish, Yoni/J-2173-2019","Gavish, Yoni/0000-0002-6025-5668",Seventh Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU) [308454]; Nigel Bertram Charitable Trust,"Seventh Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 308454; Nigel Bertram Charitable Trust",,,1,1,2,14,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The implicit assumption is that this will increase knowledge and, in turn, lead to better decision-making. However, the justification for this assumption remains uncertain, not least because the definition of 'prediction' is unclear. We propose that two types of prediction should be distinguished: corroboratory-prediction is linked to the validation of theories; and anticipatory-prediction is linked to the description of possible futures. We then discuss four families of obstacles to prediction, linked to the specific features of ecosystems: 1) they are historical entities, 2) they are complex, 3) their dynamics are stochastic, and 4) they are influenced by socio-economic drivers. A naive understanding of ecological science suggests that the two types of predictions are simply two phases in a sequence in which scientists first improve their knowledge of ecological systems via corroboratory-predictions, and then apply this knowledge in order to forecast future states of ecosystems via anticipatory-predictions in order to help policy makers taking decisions. This sequence is however not straightforward, partly because corroboration and anticipation are not affected by the obstacles to prediction in the same way. We thus invite to reconsider the role of ecological prediction as a tool in a deliberative model of decision-making rather than as external scientific information aimed at enlightening the political process. Doing so would be beneficial for both the policy-relevance of anticipatory-prediction and the theoretical-relevance of corroboratory-prediction.",,,,"Pradel, Roger/A-8666-2008","Pradel, Roger/0000-0002-2684-9251; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770",Centre de Recherche en Ethique in Montreal; INSHS-CNRS program for international mobility; GDR-Sapienv [CNRS 3770]; Agence Nationale de RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [Explabio ANR 13-BSH3-0007]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)European Union (EU) [283068],VM benefited from a fellowship at the Centre de Recherche en Ethique in Montreal and a grant from the INSHS-CNRS program for international mobility.

Cellular traits-which determine responses to the abiotic and biotic environment-may help us rigorously link them. However, our capacity to measure traits in natural communities has thus far been limited. Here we compared the predictive power of trait richness (trait space coverage), evenness (regularity in trait distribution) and divergence (prevalence of extreme phenotypes) derived from individual-based measurements with two species-level metrics (taxonomic richness and evenness) when modelling the productivity of natural phytoplankton communities. Using phytoplankton data obtained from 28 lakes sampled at different spatial and temporal scales, we found that the diversity in individual-level morphophysiological traits strongly improved our ability to predict community resource-use and biomass yield. Trait evenness-the regularity in distribution of individual cells/colonies within the trait space-was the strongest predictor, exhibiting a robust negative relationship across scales. Our study suggests that quantifying individual microbial phenotypes in trait space may help us understand how to link physiology to ecosystem-scale processes. Elucidating the mechanisms scaling individual-level trait variation to microbial community dynamics could there improve our ability to forecast changes in ecosystem properties across environmental gradients.",,,,,"Thomas, Mridul/0000-0002-5089-5610; Fontana, Simone/0000-0003-1194-1909","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_144053, CRSII2_147654, IZERZ0_142165]","This research is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Projects 31003A_144053, CRSII2_147654 and IZERZ0_142165 (Enlargement Contribution Project 'CyanoArchive', in the framework of the Romanian-Swiss Research Programme).

A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to assess the effect of changing parameters values on the yield simulated by the model (both EMS and MMS) for different crops (winter and durum wheat, winter barley, maize, sunflower) grown under a variety of conditions (including future climate realisations) in Europe. A two-step SA was performed using global techniques: the Morris screening method for qualitative ranking of parameters was first used, followed by the eFAST variance-based method, which attributes portions of variance in the model output to each parameter. The results showed that the parameters related to the partitioning of assimilates to storage organs (FOTB) and to the conversion efficiency of photosynthates into storage organs (CVO) generally affected considerably the simulated yield (also underlying tight correlation with this output), whereas the parameters involved with respiration rate (Q10) or specific leaf area (SLA) became influential in case of unfavourable weather conditions. Major differences between EMS and MMS (which includes a component simulating the impact of extreme weather events) emerged in extreme cases of crop failure triggered by markedly negative minimum temperatures. With few exceptions, the two SA methods revealed the same parameter ranking. We argue that the SA performed in this study can be useful in the design of crop modelling studies and in the implementation of crop yield forecasting systems in Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Among a set of ecological time series originating from the long-term monitoring of three large and deep lakes, nonlinear forecasting methods (Simplex projection and S-map) indicated that most of the time series exhibited hallmarks of complex dynamics in the form of nonlinear behaviors. Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) was used to estimate the causal relationships among these time series by considering different time lags. The significant causal relationships were then used to construct causal networks from which nodes were characterized using PageRank and CheiRank. For the three lakes, the dominance of bottom-up control was revealed and was mostly indirect (i.e., nutrient-forcing zooplankton). This result likely evidences the transitivity of the causal relationships obtained by CCM as well as the mixed phytoplankton diet of zooplankton species limiting the identification of causal relationships among these two ecological components. Complementarily, the consistence of causal relationships for the different time lags may highlight a temporal transitivity by which the instantaneous causal signal was transmitted over time. The dual representation of both PageRank and CheiRank provided a straightforward classification of each node and enabled their thorough implications in the information flow within the causal networks. The complementary use of CCM and network metrics constituted an efficient way to delineate ecological causation using a high-resolution time series, for which linear methods performed poorly, and provided insights into the dynamic hierarchy of the different ecological variables in aquatic ecosystems.

In Australia, wild dogs (Canis lupus familiaris, Canis lupus dingo, and hybrids) cause economic losses of more than AUD$40 M annually. Landscape scale exclusion fencing coupled with lethal techniques is a widely practiced control method. In Western Australia, the State Barrier Fence encompasses approximately 260,000 km(2) of predominantly agricultural land, but its effectiveness in preventing wild dogs from entering the agricultural region is difficult to evaluate. We conducted a management strategy evaluation (MSE) based on spatially-explicit population models to forecast the effects of upgrades to the Western Australian State Barrier Fence and several control scenarios varying in intensity and spatial extent on wild dog populations in southwest Western Australia. The model results indicate that populations of wild dogs on both sides of the State Barrier Fence are self-sustaining and current control practices are not sufficient to effectively reduce their abundance in the agricultural region. Only when a combination of control techniques is applied on a large scale, intensively and continuously are wild dog numbers effectively controlled. This study identifies the requirement for addressing extant populations of predators within fenced areas to meet the objective of preventing wild dog expansion. This objective is only achieved when control is applied to the whole area where wild dogs are currently present within the fence plus an additional buffer of similar to 20 km. Our modelling focused on the use of baiting, trapping and shooting; however, we acknowledge that additional tools may also be applied. Finally, we recommend that a cost-benefit analysis be performed to evaluate the economic viability of an integrated control strategy. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Recent attention has focused on how rapid evolution can impact ecological dynamics via adaptive trait change. However, the impact of trait change arising from plastic responses has received less attention, and is often assumed to optimize performance and unfold on a separate, faster timescale than ecological dynamics. Challenging these assumptions, we propose that gradual plasticity is important for ecological dynamics, and present a study of the plastic responses of the freshwater green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as it acclimates to temperature changes. First, we show that C. reinhardtii's gradual acclimation responses can both enhance and suppress its performance after a perturbation, depending on its prior thermal history. Second, we demonstrate that where conventional approaches fail to predict the population dynamics of C. reinhardtii exposed to temperature fluctuations, a new model of gradual acclimation succeeds. Finally, using high-resolution data, we show that phytoplankton in lake ecosystems can experience thermal variation sufficient to make acclimation relevant. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasticity's interactions with ecological dynamics. Amidst the current emphasis on rapid evolution, it is critical that we also develop predictive methods accounting for plasticity.",,,,,"Arellano, Aldo/0000-0002-3780-1130",NSF PRFB [1402074]; James S.

The evergreen shrubs that characterize chaparral are well adapted to long, hot, dry summers and extreme fluctuations in inter-annual precipitation. Despite the ability of chaparral species to tolerate climatic extremes, the integrity of the chaparral ecosystem is currently being challenged by rising temperatures, increased variability in precipitation, and longer and more persistent droughts. Climate scenarios for California project continued warming through the century leading to increased physiological stress, canopy thinning, and mortality of chaparral vegetation across portions of the state. In some instances, however, chaparral vegetation may expand into forested landscapes. Climate change forecasts suggest enhanced fire activity, including an extended fire season and more frequent large fires. In this already stressed system, non-climate stressors, like increased fire frequencies, can lead to decreased shrub biomass, loss of species diversity, and conversion to other vegetation types. Chaparral in southern California is already trending toward conversion to dominance by non-native annual grasses, and climate projections suggest that this trend will continue in the future. In this chapter, we evaluate historical and projected climate trends in California and explain how they might directly and indirectly affect the integrity and persistence of chaparral on the landscape. We show that the interaction of climate and non-climate stressors can drive landscape level conversion of shrublands to non-native annual grasses leading to the loss of social and ecological benefits provided by the ecosystem. We provide a detailed review of projected changes in carbon storage for one of the (under-valued) ecosystem services provided by chaparral. We conclude by highlighting key management lessons from our review, and point to a few high priority information gaps that must be filled by future research.",,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,18,,,,0172-6161,,978-3-319-68303-4; 978-3-319-68302-7,SPRINGER SER ENV MAN,Springer Ser.

The main aim is to determine the effectiveness of using the monitoring of tourist and recreational activities as an indicator in forecasting the development of a tourist territory using the example of specially protected natural areas of the Volgograd Region. Methods. In conducting this study, a number of scientific and practical methods were used, such as the method of processing and analyzing statistical data on the number of ecological paths and tourist routes in the natural parks of the Volgograd region as well as the method of geo-information processing of the collected data, the modeling of results and analysis of statistical data. Tourist flow data for the period from 2002 to 2016 was also used. Results. As a result of the research, it was revealed that the value of the indicator of the number of tourist routes in the natural parks of the Volgograd region is increasing annually. Among the entire range of tourist services provided by the natural parks of the region, car tours prevail. Analyzing the information on the visits to the natural parks, we can conclude that the services of the Eltonsky, Shcherbakovsky, Donskoy and Ust-Medveditsky natural parks are the most demanded by the consumer. Conclusions. Summarizing, we can conclude that there is no correlation between the increase in the number of tourist routes in natural parks and the increase in the number of tourists in the region's protected areas. In this regard, it is necessary to develop a long-term strategy for the development of the tourist and recreational attractiveness of the protected areas of the Volgograd region.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,1992-1098,2413-0958,,S RUSS-ECOL DEV,South Russ.-Ecol.

The quality of input data is crucial determinant of the model's accuracy. While museum records can be useful sources of presence data for many species, they do not always include accurate geographic coordinates. Therefore, actual locations must be verified through the process of georeferencing. We present a practical, standardized manual georeferencing method (the Spatial Analysis Georeferencing Accuracy (SAGA) protocol) to classify the spatial resolution of museum records specifically for building improved SDMs. We used the high-elevation plant Saxifraga austromontana Wiegand (Saxifragaceae) as a case study to test the effect of using this protocol when developing an SDM. In MAXENT, we generated and compared SDMs using a comprehensive occurrence dataset that had undergone three different levels of georeferencing: (1) trained using all publicly available herbarium records of the species, minus outliers (2) trained using herbarium records claimed to be previously georeferenced, and (3) trained using herbarium records that we have manually georeferenced to a <= 1-km resolution using the SAGA protocol. Model predictions of suitable habitat for S.austromontana differed greatly depending on georeferencing level. The SDMs fitted with presence locations georeferenced using SAGA outperformed all others. Differences among models were exacerbated for future distribution predictions. Under rapid climate change, accurately forecasting the response of species becomes increasingly important. Failure to georeference location data and cull inaccurate samples leads to erroneous model output, limiting the utility of spatial analyses. We present a simple, standardized georeferencing method to be adopted by curators, ecologists, and modelers to improve the geographic accuracy of museum records and SDM predictions.",,,,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1256832]; American Alpine Club; North Cascades Audubon Society; Mazamas Graduate Research Grant; Fraser Family Fellowship; Western Washington University (WWU) Biology Faculty Fellowship,"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1256832; American Alpine Club; North Cascades Audubon Society; Mazamas Graduate Research Grant; Fraser Family Fellowship; Western Washington University (WWU) Biology Faculty Fellowship",,,6,6,3,21,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, empirical information regarding long-term decomposition rates of foliage and wood remains rare. In this study, we assessed long-term C and N dynamics (12-13 years) during decomposition of foliage and wood for three boreal tree species, under a range of harvesting intensities and slash treatments. We used model selection based on the second-order Akaike's Information Criterion to determine which decomposition model had the most support. The double-exponential model provided a good fit to C mass loss for foliage of trembling aspen, white spruce, and balsam fir, as well as aspen wood. These litters underwent a rapid initial phase of leaching and mineralisation, followed by a slow decomposition. In contrast, for spruce and fir wood, the single-exponential model had the most support. The long-term average decay rate of wood was faster than that of foliage for aspen, but not of conifers. However, we found no evidence that fir and spruce wood decomposed at slower rates than the recalcitrant fraction of their foliage. The critical C:N ratios, at which net N mineralisation began, were higher for wood than for foliage. Long-term decay rates following clear-cutting were either similar or faster than those observed in control stands, depending on litter material, tree species, and slash treatment. The critical C:N ratios were reached later and decreased for all conifer litters following stem-only clear-cutting, indicating increased N retention in harvested sites with high slash loads. Partial harvesting had weak effects on C and N dynamics of decaying litters. A comprehensive understanding of the long-term patterns and controls of C and N dynamics following forest disturbance would improve our ability to forecast the implications of forest harvesting for C sequestration and nutrient availability.",,,,,,"Programme de financement de la recherche et du developpement en amenagement forestier of the Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs du Quebec; Cooperative Research Development Program (NSERC) of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RDC475301-14]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [NSERCs 217118]; Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest; Tembec Inc.","We are grateful to Josee Frenette, Mylene Belanger, Emilie Robert, Alfred Coulombe, and Mario Major for field assistance, Serge Rousseau for laboratory analyses, and William F.

Yet, how biological communities respond to concurrent stressors at local-to-regional scales remains largely unknown. In particular, understanding how local habitat conversion interacts with regional climate change to shape patterns in beta-diversity-differences among sites in their species compositions-is critical to forecast communities in the Anthropocene. Here, we study patterns in bird beta-diversity across land-use and precipitation gradients in Costa Rica. We mapped forest cover, modeled regional precipitation, and collected data on bird community composition, vegetation structure, and tree diversity across 120 sites on 20 farms to answer three questions. First, do bird communities respond more strongly to changes in land use or climate in northwest Costa Rica? Second, does habitat conversion eliminate beta-diversity across climate gradients? Third, does regional climate control how communities respond to habitat conversion and, if so, how? After correcting for imperfect detection, we found that local land-use determined community shifts along the climate gradient. In forests, bird communities were distinct between sites that differed in vegetation structure or precipitation. In agriculture, however, vegetation structure was more uniform, contributing to 7%-11% less bird turnover than in forests. In addition, bird responses to agriculture and climate were linked: agricultural communities across the precipitation gradient shared more species with dry than wet forest communities. These findings suggest that habitat conversion and anticipated climate drying will act together to exacerbate biotic homogenization.",,,,"; Chan, Kai/C-1682-2009","Echeverri, Alejandra/0000-0002-8821-0509; Frishkoff, Luke/0000-0001-5738-2140; Chan, Kai/0000-0002-7804-3276",UBC [Doctoral Graduate Leadership Fellowship]; University of TorontoUniversity of Toronto [EEB post-doctoral fellowship]; Belmont Forum [G8PJ-437336-2012]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [06-5566],"Killam, Grant/Award Number: postdoctoral fellowship; UBC, Grant/Award Number: Doctoral Graduate Leadership Fellowship; University of Toronto, Grant/Award Number: EEB post-doctoral fellowship; Belmont Forum, Grant/Award Number: G8PJ-437336-2012; NSERC, Grant/Award Number: 06-5566",,,23,23,4,26,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

So far, mountain areas have mostly been spared from large-scale invasions. However, climate change, land-use abandonment, the development of tourism and the increasing ornamental trade will weaken the barriers to invasions in these systems. Understanding how alien species will react and how native communities will influence their success is thus of prime importance in a management perspective. Here, we used a spatially and temporally explicit simulation model to forecast invasion risks in a protected mountain area in the French Alps under future conditions. We combined scenarios of climate change, land-use abandonment and tourism-linked increases in propagule pressure to test if the spread of alien species in the region will increase in the future. We modelled already naturalized alien species and new ornamental plants, accounting for interactions among global change components, and also competition with the native vegetation. Our results show that propagule pressure and climate change will interact to increase overall species richness of both naturalized aliens and new ornamentals, as well as their upper elevational limits and regional range-sizes. Under climate change, woody aliens are predicted to more than double in range-size and herbaceous species to occupy up to 20% of the park area. In contrast, land-use abandonment will open new invasion opportunities for woody aliens, but decrease invasion probability for naturalized and ornamental alien herbs as a consequence of colonization by native trees. This emphasizes the importance of interactions with the native vegetation either for facilitating or potentially for curbing invasions. Overall, our work highlights an additional and previously underestimated threat for the fragile mountain flora of the Alps already facing climate changes, land-use transformations and overexploitation by tourism.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012; Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758; Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Dullinger, Iwona/0000-0002-2692-2973; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887; Boulangeat, Isabelle/0000-0002-8463-7046; Barros, Ceres/0000-0003-4036-977X; Talluto, Matthew/0000-0001-5188-7332",FP7 People: Marie-Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU) [FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF]; IASIMOV [327616]; ERA-Net BiodivERsA [I-1443-B25]; Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the European Commission's Seventh Framework Program [IASIMOV 327616]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-INBS-0001AnaEE-Services],"FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions, Grant/Award Number: FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF; IASIMOV 327616; ERA-Net BiodivERsA, Grant/Award Number: project ""Who Is Next"" I-1443-B25; Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the European Commission's Seventh Framework Program, Grant/Award Number: FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF, IASIMOV 327616; ANR, Grant/Award Number: ANR-11-INBS-0001AnaEE-Services",,,17,17,11,50,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Ocean temperature and nutrients typically covary over local and regional scales and play a crucial role on kelp dynamics. Examining their independent and interactive effects on kelp physiological performance is essential to understand and predict patterns of kelp distribution, particularly under scenarios of global change. Crossed combinations of ocean temperatures and availability of nutrients were experimentally tested on juveniles of the golden kelp', Laminaria ochroleuca, from the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. Eco-physiological responses included: survival, growth and total N content. Results were embedded into a Species Distribution Model (SDM), which relates presence records and climatic and non-climatic data to forecast distribution patterns of L.ochroleuca under different climate change scenarios. Temperatures above 24.6 degrees C were lethal irrespective of nutrients. Optimal growth of juvenile sporophytes occurred between 12 and 18 degrees C and no nutrient limitation. The SDM, where ocean temperature was the main predictor of kelp distribution in line with temperature thresholds given by eco-physiological responses, suggests a future expansion towards northern latitudes and a retreat from the southern limit/boundary of the current distribution.Synthesis. Range-shifting of the golden kelp can have severe ecological impacts at regional and local scales. The expansion or retraction of the species along the European coast seems to be modulated mainly by temperature, but nutrient availability would be a key to maintain optimal physiological performance. Our work highlights that the combination of empirical and modelling approaches is accessible to researchers and crucial to building more robust predictions of ecological and biogeographic responses of habitat-forming species to forecasted environmental change.",,,,"Pinto, Isabel Sousa/W-1591-2019; Martinez, Brezo/AAE-9825-2019; Arenas, Francisco/M-7095-2015; Bertocci, Iacopo/I-5121-2013","Pinto, Isabel Sousa/0000-0002-9231-0553; Martinez, Brezo/0000-0002-7501-7726; Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805; Franco, Joao N/0000-0002-8249-5224; Bertocci, Iacopo/0000-0002-1519-1677","European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU) [PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/MAR/109954/2009, PTDC/MAR/105147/2008, SFRH/BD/84933/2012]","European Regional Development Fund, Grant/Award Number: POFC-COMPETE, QREN and PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: (PTDC/MAR/109954/2009), (PTDC/MAR/105147/2008) and (SFRH/BD/84933/2012)",,,36,37,8,19,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

To gather comprehensive information on anthropization dynamics in forest landscapes, fine-scale surveys of deforestation are required, coupled with detailed analysis of both spatial transformation processes and forest patch geometry. We conducted such a comprehensive study in a monospecific Uapaca bojeri (Baill.) forest of Madagascar, between 1999 and 2013. A diachronic set of four maps was produced and deforestation rates were calculated. Spatial transformation processes were described using Bogaert et al. (2004) typology. Forest patch geometry was monitored using largest patch index, mean patch size, and squared mean patch size to describe patch size dynamics, mean shape index and area weighted mean shape index to describe patch compactness, and fractal dimension analysis to describe patch outline complexity. For fractal dimension analysis, an innovative segmented regression model (Muggeo 2008) was used to separately quantify fractal dimensions for multiple ranges of patch sizes. Our results showed a growing anthropization of the U. bojeri forest landscape in the area, through a strong yet decelerating deforestation (from - 59.5% year(-1) between 1999 and 2005 to - 2.84% year(-1) between 2009 and 2013), clear forest fragmentation, and a subtle yet growing-in-scale simplification of patch geometry for small forest patches. Deforestation was artisanal in nature and, in 2013, large patches were withdrawing to less accessible topographic features. Our results forecast a medium-term loss of resilience of the U. bojeri forest in the area, if no direct forest conservation measures are taken.",,,,"Beeckman, Hans/I-7653-2019","Beeckman, Hans/0000-0001-8954-6277; Brostaux, Yves/0000-0001-6172-7869; Verheggen, Francois/0000-0002-5849-1661",Belgian University Commission for Development (CUD),"The authors thank the GeVaBo project and its funding body, the Belgian University Commission for Development (CUD).

This paper aims at measuring canopy layer heat island (CLHI) in a compact city of Nagpur, India using local climate zone (LCZ) classification. It also accesses the inter-LCZ temperature difference within the city and identifies critical areas that require intervention to curb heat island. The methodology describes LCZs mapping, data collection technique using fixed station points and mobile traverse survey conducted during the month of December 2015 and February 2016 of winter season. The paper adopts rigorous data filtering technique to avoid the errors in reporting UHI of cities having compact and heterogeneous built form like Nagpur. The study covers temperature buffer analysis, sensor lag determination, forecasting, outlier analysis and Pearson - correlation technique. It also examines the thermal anomaly in different LCZ with respect to cities average for identifying critical areas. The result shows that UHI intensity within built LCZ (IUHI), in winter season for Nagpur city, ranges from 1.76 to 4.09 degrees C. The compact low-rise LCZs present at the urban core were found to be warmer than other major LCZ present in the inner areas of the city. The study also reports thermal variation between traditional LCZs and the LCZs with subclasses.

However, expert judgements can be prone to contextual biases. Structured elicitation protocols mitigate these biases, and improve the accuracy and transparency of the resulting judgements. Despite this, the elicitation of expert judgement within conservation and natural resource management remains largely informal. We suggest this may be attributed to financial and practical constraints, which are not addressed by many existing structured elicitation protocols. In this paper, we advocate that structured elicitation protocols must be adopted when expert judgements are used to inform science. In order to motivate a wider adoption of structured elicitation protocols, we outline the IDEA protocol. The protocol improves the accuracy of expert judgements and includes several key steps which may be familiar to many conservation researchers, such as the four-step elicitation, and a modified Delphi procedure (Investigate, Discuss, Estimate and Aggregate). It can also incorporate remote elicitation, making structured expert judgement accessible on a modest budget. The IDEA protocol has recently been outlined in the scientific literature; however, a detailed description has been missing. This paper fills that important gap by clearly outlining each of the steps required to prepare for and undertake an elicitation. While this paper focuses on the need for the IDEA protocol within conservation and natural resource management, the protocol (and the advice contained in this paper) is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains, as evidenced by its application to biosecurity, engineering and political forecasting. By clearly outlining the IDEA protocol, we hope that structured protocols will be more widely understood and adopted, resulting in improved judgements and increased transparency when expert judgement is required.",,,,"Hanea, Anca/AAI-5294-2020","Hanea, Anca/0000-0003-3870-5949; Wintle, Bonnie/0000-0003-0236-6906","Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis; University of MelbourneUniversity of Melbourne; Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London; Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF) through the University of Cambridge","The Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis; University of Melbourne; Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London; Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF) through the University of Cambridge",,,35,34,3,20,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

For instance, how will climate change alter complex, multi-species relationships that are modulated by climatic variation and that underlie ecosystem-level processes? Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a keystone species in Newfoundland, Canada, provides a useful model for unravelling potential and complex long-term implications of climate change on biotic interactions and population change. We measured cause-specific caribou calf predation (1990-2013) in Newfoundland relative to seasonal weather patterns. We show that black bear (Ursus americanus) predation is facilitated by time-lagged higher summer growing degree days, whereas coyote (Canis latrans) predation increases with current precipitation and winter temperature. Based on future climate forecasts for the region, we illustrate that, through time, coyote predation on caribou calves could become increasingly important, whereas the influence of black bear would remain unchanged. From these predictions, demographic projections for caribou suggest long-term population limitation specifically through indirect effects of climate change on calf predation rates by coyotes. While our work assumes limited impact of climate change on other processes, it illustrates the range of impact that climate change can have on predator-prey interactions. We conclude that future efforts to predict potential effects of climate change on populations and ecosystems should include assessment of both direct and indirect effects, including climate-predator interactions.",,,,"Ellington, E.

The arrival of electrification to nearly every corner of the planet is certainly the first and more meaningful indicator of artificialization of land. In this sense, the paper proposes a new methodology designed to identify the highly impacted landscapes in China based on the analysis of the satellite image of nighttime lights. The night-lights have been used widespread in scientific contributions, from building human development indices, identifying megalopolis [2] [3] or analyzing the phenomenon of urbanization and sprawl [4], but generally they have not been used to forecast the urbanization in the near future. This paper proposes to study the urbanization impact in China between 1992 and 2013, and models a hypothesis of future scenarios of urbanization (2013-2025). For this purpose, the paper uses DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights (1992 - 2013). After obtaining a homogeneous series for the whole period 19922013, we proceed to model the spatial dynamics of past urbanization process using the ""urbanistic potential"" of each of the 13.7 millions of analyzed cells. This model allows to design a probable growth of the urbanization phenomenon between 2013 and 2025 as well to predict a progressive displacement of the urbanization from east coast to mainland and west, in congruence with the current demographic models [5].",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,3,,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-2106-0,PROC SPIE,,,2018,10767,,,,,,,,UNSP 107670A,10.1117/12.2321267,,,,Ecology; Remote Sensing; Optics,,,WOS:000452820600007,,,,,

However, the mechanism of sea level change is complex. The traditional method has some limitations for non-stationary nonlinear time series forecasting, and the prediction accuracy needs to be further improved. In this paper, we use the monthly mean tide level series from Zhapo Station (1959 similar to 2011), and combine the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition(EEMD), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network to propose a improved EEMD-GA-BP method for regional sea level change prediction. In this study, the EEMD method was used to decompose the original series and generate multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMF) according to different spectral characteristics of signals implied in the tide level series, to stabilize the time series, and improve signal to noise ratio. GA is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of BP Neural Network, due to the difficulty of determining the initial weight and threshold in BP Neural Network. Taking each IMF as the input factor of BP Neural Network, the future trend of each IMF is predicted respectively. Finally, the output of the IMF is reconstructed to obtain the predicted value of the original series. The results show that EEMD can effectively extract multi-time scale signals implicit in the series. BP Neural Network optimized by GA can well predict the future trend of sea level. Compared with the direct use of BP Neural Network algorithm, the use of EEMD for non-stationary non-linear time series smoothing, noise reduction and other processing can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. The use of GA optimize BP Neural Network can improve the accuracy.

Gray wolves Canis lupus began recolonizing Washington in 2008. We used generalized linear mixed models to investigate characteristics of wolf pack territories in Idaho and Montana from 1991-2008 (n = 137) and predict cattle Bos taurus depredation risk for current and probable wolf-occupied areas in Washington. Cattle depredation risk increased with cattle abundance and if the pack depredated cattle the previous year. When models were applied to wolf pack territories in Washington from 2008-2016 (n - 43), 3 of 7 (43%) depredating pack territory/years were predicted at >= 61% depredation risk. During the summer grazing season (1 May - 31 October) when most cattle depredations (97%; n = 34) occurred in Washington, cattle east of the Cascade Mountains were often on grazing allotments whereas cattle west of the Cascade Mountains were located on small, private farms. Thus, relative cattle abundance per grazing allotment and county likely represented cattle depredation risk east and west of the Cascade Mountains, respectively. County-wide and allotment cattle abundance forecasted 10.3% and 1.4% of probable wolf-occupied areas at >= 61% cattle depredation risk, respectively. These risk models and maps provide locations for federal and state wildlife managers to focus depredation prevention measures and a template for future analyses as wolves continue to recolonize Washington.",,,,,,Washington State Legislature; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,Funding for this study was provided by the Washington State Legislature and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.,,,1,1,1,13,,,,0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,,2018,,,,,,,,,wlb.00419,10.2981/wlb.00419,,,,Ecology; Zoology,,,WOS:000439094400001,,,,,

Consequently, there is a real need to develop an early cautionary system that can be used to warn local publics of any forecasted ozone violations, which enables them to take necessary precautions. One way to do so is through developing an ozone forecast model based on readily and routinely measured meteorological parameters. Thus, this paper aims to develop a forecast model that predicts instantaneous ozone concentration at Zarqa based on air temperature using linear regression model. The data was obtained through the air quality monitoring station which is operated by the department of water management and environment inside the campus of the Hashemite University for the period of two years from of January 2012 to 30th of December 2013. Statistical analysis revealed that ozone levels have exceeded the Jordanian Ambient Air Quality Standard (JAAQS) in Zarqa. Correlations between measured ozone concentration and meteorological parameters including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction are investigated. It is found that air temperature correlate well with ozone concentration, and thereby a regression formula that calculates ozone based on air temperature is retrieved.

Forecasts for such interactions have been most pronounced for the Southern Ocean islands where ameliorating conditions are expected to decrease thermal and resource restrictions on rodents. Firm evidence for changing rodent populations in response to climate change, and demonstrations of associated impacts on the terrestrial environment, are nonetheless entirely absent for the region. Using data collected over three decades on sub-Antarctic Marion Island, we tested empirically whether mouse populations have changed through time and whether these changes can be associated significantly with changing abiotic conditions. Changes in invertebrate populations, which have previously been attributed to mouse predation, but with little explicit demographic analysis, were also examined to determine whether they can be associated with changing mouse populations. The total number of mice on the island at annual peak density increased by 430.0% between 1979-1980 and 2008-2011. This increase was due to an advanced breeding season, which was robustly related to the number of precipitation-free days during the non-breeding season. Mice directly reduced invertebrate densities, with biomass losses of up to two orders of magnitude in some habitats. Such invertebrate declines are expected to have significant consequences for ecosystem processes over the long term. Our results demonstrate that as climate change continues to create ameliorating conditions for invasive rodents on sub-Antarctic islands, the severity of their impacts will increase. They also emphasize the importance of rodent eradication for the restoration of invaded islands.",,,,"Chown, Steven/H-3347-2011","Chown, Steven/0000-0001-6069-5105",South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP); South African National Research Foundation (NRF)National Research Foundation - South Africa [SNA2011110700005]; SANAP bursary; NRF [85802],We thank all members of the Marion Island overwintering teams that contributed to the data collection and the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP) for logistic and funding support over many years.

Local environmental variation plays an important role in species-environment interactions in neritic squids, which inhabit nearshore/coastal waters. Such active' and passive' responses of squids to environmental changes is crucial in understanding their relationships and influence on the biological processes, distribution and abundance of the fast-growing short-lived coastal loliginids. The empirical relationship between squid abundance and the variability in rainfall and sea surface temperature (SST) were explored in a tropical monsoon fishery. Monthly catch rates (catch per fishing hour) of squids in commercial trawl during 1987-2009 were used as the abundance index. Linear regression models with ARIMA errors were fitted with catch per unit hour time series as dependent variable and rainfall and SST as exogenous variables. While rainfall was observed to have a negative effect on squid abundance, the SST recorded a positive impact. ARIMA models provided satisfactory fit to observed data and forecast of 22months. Given that the squid life-cycle is a function of their environment, this result is relevant in forecasting squid biomass for the management of tropical monsoon fisheries.",,,,,"Sajikumar, K.K/0000-0003-1106-3800; Mohamed, Kolliyil/0000-0002-7720-4090",ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) [PEL/IDP/02],This work was supported by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) [PEL/IDP/02].,,,0,0,1,5,,,,0022-2933,1464-5262,,J NAT HIST,J.

Ecological theory and few observation studies indicate that trees with acquisitive functional traits would respond more strongly to higher resource availability than those with conservative traits. We assessed how long-term tree growth in experimental nutrient addition plots (N, P, and N + P) varied as a function of morphological traits, tree size, and species identity. We also evaluated how trait-based responses affected stand scale biomass production considering the community structure. We found that tree growth depended on interactions between functional traits and the type or combination of nutrients added. Common species with acquisitive functional traits responded more strongly to nutrient addition, mainly to N + P. Phosphorous enhanced the growth rates of species with acquisitive and conservative traits, had mostly positive effects on common species and neutral or negative effects in rare species. Moreover, trees receiving N + P grew faster irrespective of their initial size relative to trees in control or to trees in other treatment plots. Finally, species responses were highly idiosyncratic suggesting that community processes including competition and niche dimensionality may be altered under increased resource availability. We found no statistically significant effects of nutrient additions on aboveground biomass productivity because acquisitive species had a limited potential to increase their biomass, possibly due to their generally lower wood density. In contrast, P addition increased the growth rates of species characterized by more conservative resource strategies (with higher wood density) that were poorly represented in the plant community. We provide the first long-term experimental evidence that trait-based responses, community structure, and community processes modulate the effects of increased nutrient availability on biomass productivity in a tropical forest.",,,,"Homeier, Jurgen/G-1662-2011","Homeier, Jurgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Baez, Selene/0000-0002-7236-6242","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4]; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch DienstDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [91587171]","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst, Grant/Award Number: 91587171",,,5,6,7,41,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Evaluating the level of confidence is particularly important when predictions are used to guide conservation or restoration decisions. We used a multi-model approach to predict climate change impacts on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), the dominant plant species on roughly 43 million hectares in the western United States and a key resource for many endemic wildlife species. To evaluate the climate sensitivity of A. tridentata, we developed four predictive models, two based on empirically derived spatial and temporal relationships, and two that applied mechanistic approaches to simulate sagebrush recruitment and growth. This approach enabled us to produce an aggregate index of climate change vulnerability and uncertainty based on the level of agreement between models. Despite large differences in model structure, predictions of sagebrush response to climate change were largely consistent. Performance, as measured by change in cover, growth, or recruitment, was predicted to decrease at the warmest sites, but increase throughout the cooler portions of sagebrush's range. A sensitivity analysis indicated that sagebrush performance responds more strongly to changes in temperature than precipitation. Most of the uncertainty in model predictions reflected variation among the ecological models, raising questions about the reliability of forecasts based on a single modeling approach. Our results highlight the value of a multimodel approach in forecasting climate change impacts and uncertainties and should help land managers to maximize the value of conservation investments.",,,,"Aldridge, Cameron L/F-4025-2011; Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/O-8956-2019; Schlaepfer, Daniel R/D-1756-2009","Aldridge, Cameron L/0000-0003-3926-6941; Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/0000-0003-2149-2027; Schlaepfer, Daniel R/0000-0001-9973-2065; Renwick, Katherine/0000-0003-0094-8689; Poulter, Benjamin/0000-0002-9493-8600",NASA Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting Program [NESSF: 15-EARTH15F-133]; United States Geological Survey North Central Climate Science Center [G15AP00073]; Great Basin Landscape Conservation Cooperative,"NASA Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting Program, Grant/Award Number: NESSF: 15-EARTH15F-133; United States Geological Survey North Central Climate Science Center, Grant/Award Number: G15AP00073; Great Basin Landscape Conservation Cooperative",,,13,13,2,24,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

While the direct effects of environmental drivers on fish early life stage survival can be quantified experimentally, indirect effects in marine ecosystems and the role of adaptation are still highly uncertain. We developed an integrative model for the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the early life stages of Atlantic cod in the Barents Sea, termed SCREI (Simulator of Cod Recruitment under Environmental Influences). Experimental results on temperature and CO2 effects on egg fertilization, egg and larval survival and development times are incorporated. Calibration using empirical time series of egg production, temperature, food and predator abundance reproduces age-0 recruitment over three decades. We project trajectories of recruitment success under different scenarios and quantify confidence limits based on variation in experiments. A publicly accessible web version of the SCREI model can be run under www.oceanchange.uni-bremen.de/SCREI. Severe reductions in average age-0 recruitment success of Barents Sea cod are projected under uncompensated warming and acidification toward the middle to end of this century. Although high population stochasticity was found, considerable rates of evolutionary adaptation to acidification and shifts in organismal thermal windows would be needed to buffer impacts on recruitment. While increases in food availability may mitigate short-term impacts, an increase in egg production achieved by stock management could provide more long-term safety for cod recruitment success. The SCREI model provides a novel integration of multiple driver effects in different life stages and enables an estimation of uncertainty associated with interindividual and ecological variation. The model thus helps to advance toward an improved empirical foundation for quantifying climate change impacts on marine fish recruitment, relevant for ecosystem-based assessments of marine systems under climate change.",,,,"Portner, Hans-O./K-9429-2016; Clemmesen, Catriona/B-1480-2014; Stiasny, Martina/O-4988-2018","Portner, Hans-O./0000-0001-6535-6575; Clemmesen, Catriona/0000-0003-4102-7341; Stiasny, Martina/0000-0001-6365-2610","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [03F0655, 03F0728]; Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, PACES (Polar Regions and Coasts in a Changing Earth System) program; AquaExcel","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 03F0655, 03F0728; Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, PACES (Polar Regions and Coasts in a Changing Earth System) program; AquaExcel",,,6,6,4,32,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

There are currently hundreds of published, ongoing, and new drought experiments worldwide aimed to assess ecological sensitivity to drought and identify the mechanisms governing resistance and resilience. To date, the results from these experiments have varied widely, and thus, patterns of drought sensitivities and the underlying mechanisms have been difficult to discern. Here we examined 89 published drought experiments, along with their associated historical precipitation records to (1) identify where and how drought experiments have been imposed, (2) determine the extremity of drought treatments in the context of historical climate, and (3) assess the influence of ambient precipitation variability on the magnitude of drought experiments. In general, drought experiments were most common in water-limited ecosystems, such as grasslands, and were often short-term, as 80% were 1-4 yr in duration. When placed in a historical context, the majority of drought experiments imposed extreme drought, with 61% below the 5th, and 43% below the 1st percentile of the 50-yr annual precipitation distribution. We also determined that interannual precipitation variability had a large and potentially underappreciated effect on the magnitude of drought treatments due to the co-varying nature of control and drought precipitation inputs. Thus, detecting significant ecological effects in drought experiments is strongly influenced by the interaction between experimental drought magnitude, precipitation variability, and key ecological thresholds. The patterns that emerged from this study have important implications for the design and interpretation of drought experiments and also highlight critical gaps in our understanding of the ecological effects of drought.",,,,,,USGS Climate and Land Use program; USDA-ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); USGS Ecosystem Program,We would like to extend our gratitude to all the authors whose work we relied on for this study.

FTS models generally have some advantages when compared with other techniques used in forecasting of air pollution as they do not require any statistical assumptions on time series data; and they provide successful forecasting results even in situations where the number of observations is small and where data sets include uncertainty, still allowing for generalization. But existing FTS models based on fuzzy clustering fail in modeling of data sets that include outliers such as air pollution data. The potential superiority of the proposed model is to be a robust technique for outliers and abnormal observations. In order to show the performance of the proposed method in forecasting of air pollution, a time series consisting of SO2 concentrations measured in 65 monitoring stations in Turkey are used. According to the results of analyses, it is observed that the proposed method provides successful forecasting results especially in time series which include numerous outliers.",,,,,,,,,,15,15,2,16,,,,1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

We estimated landscape carrying capacity (N (k)) for Ovenbirds in urban, suburban, exurban, and rural areas for the years 2000 and 2050, and compared changes in N (k) with changes in occupancy probability. Maximum clique analysis, a branch of mathematical graph theory, was used to estimate landscape carrying capacity, the maximum potential number of territories a given landscape is capable of supporting (N (k)). We used occupancy probability maps as inputs for calculating Ovenbird N (k) in the northeastern USA and a spatially explicit growth model to forecast future development patterns in 2050. We compared occupancy probability with estimates of N (k) for urban, suburban, exurban, and rural areas for the years 2000 and 2050. In response to human population growth and development, Ovenbird N (k) was predicted to decrease 23% in urban landscapes, 28% in suburban landscapes, 43% in exurban landscapes, and 20% in rural landscapes. These decreases far exceeded decreases in mean occupancy probabilities that ranged between 2 and 5% across the same development categories. Thus, small decreases in occupancy probability between 2000 and 2050 translated to much larger decreases in N (k). For the first time, our study compares occupancy probability with a species population metric, N (k), to assess the impact of future development.

This area has experienced a significant habitat loss and fragmentation because of human population growth, increased farming, logging and climate change. To estimate how climate change will affect the presumed future distribution of the studied species, we constructed the possible current distribution of the species and its potential environmental risk for future dispersion. We used an ensemble prediction to forecast the location and distribution of suitable habitats for P. apodus in present and future (i.e. 2070) based on 19 environmental variables. The results were consistent among models and indicated that there are two most important variables that affect distribution pattern of the species: temperature seasonality and precipitation seasonality. All of the models used in this study showed a significant AUC and TSS value. Based upon FDA and ensemble maps it is proposed here that species range will be extended to the east, in particular in higher altitude regions like Afghanistan, but its western range in Jordan will be shrunk. Comparison of the current distribution and future prediction reveals that suitable habitats of Pseudopus apodus will be shifted to higher elevations by 2070 and during this period the species is predicted to migrate from lowlands to higher elevations.

Our models also incorporate imperfect detection as well as abundance estimation error for both species. As a case study, we applied the model to four pairs of mammal species in Borneo, surveyed by extensive and spatially widespread camera trapping. We detected different responses to elevation gradients within civet, macaque, and muntjac deer species pairs. Muntjac and porcupine species varied in their response to terrain ruggedness, and the two muntjac responded different to river proximity. Bornean endemic species of civet and muntjac were more sensitive than their widespread counterparts to habitat disturbance (selective logging). Local abundance within several species pairs was positively correlated, but this is likely due to the species having similar responses to (unmodeled) environmental conditions or resources rather than representing facilitation. After accounting for environment and correcting for false absences in detection, negative correlations in local abundance appear rare in tropical mammals. Direct competition may be weak in these species, possibly because the 'ghost of competition past' or habitat filtering have already driven separation of the species in niche space.

Based on bioclimatic envelope models, it is projected that changing precipitation patterns will drastically alter the spatial distributions and density of plants and be a primary driver of biodiversity loss. However, many other underlying mechanisms can impact plant vital rates (i.e., survival, growth, and reproduction) and population dynamics. In this study, we developed a size-dependent integral projection model (IPM) to evaluate how interannual precipitation and mollusk herbivory influence the dynamics of a Hawaii endemic short-lived shrub, Schiedea obovata (Caryophyllaceae). Assessing how wet season precipitation effects population dynamics it critical, as it is the timeframe when most of the foliar growth occurs, plants flower and fruit, and seedlings establish. Temporal variation in wet season precipitation had a greater effect than mollusk herbivory on S. obovata population growth rate , and the impact of interannual precipitation on vital rates shifted across plant ontogeny. Furthermore, wet season precipitation influenced multiple vital rates in contrasting ways and the effect of precipitation on the survival of larger vegetative and reproductively mature individuals contributed the most to variation in the population growth rate. Among all combination of wet season precipitation and herbivory intensities, the only scenario that led to a growing population was when high wet precipitation was associated with low herbivory. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating how abiotic factors and plant-consumer interactions influence an organism across its life cycle to fully understand the underpinning mechanisms that structure its spatial and temporal distribution and abundance. Our results also illustrate that for short-lived species, like S.obovata, seedling herbivory can have less of an effect on the dynamics of plant populations than decreased interannual precipitation.",,,,"Gaoue, Orou G./B-4932-2011","Gaoue, Orou G./0000-0002-0946-2741; Bialic-Murphy, Lalasia/0000-0001-6046-8316",United States Army Corps of Engineers Cooperative [W91269-11-2-0066],"United States Army Corps of Engineers Cooperative, Grant/Award Number: W91269-11-2-0066",,,1,1,4,22,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Most phenological traits are affected by environmental abiotic cues such as photoperiod, temperature and rainfall. When individuals with complex life cycles fail to match one of the stages with the favourable environment, the negative conditions experienced may lead to carry-over effects and, thus, influence fitness in subsequent stages. In the winter moth, an herbivorous insect with an annual life cycle, timing of egg-hatching in spring is strongly influenced by temperature and varies from year to year. To investigate whether the phenological variation in egg-hatching date affects subsequent stages, we analysed data on egg-hatching date and adult catching date (considered here to be a proxy for adult eclosion date) from our long-term study (1994-2014). Furthermore, we experimentally manipulated the photoperiod experienced by newly hatched larvae and recorded the phenology of their subsequent life cycle stages. In the long-term field study, we found that the timing of winter moth egg-hatching in spring varied strongly from year to year. Interestingly, however, the timing of adult eclosion date in winter showed little inter-annual variation. In line with these findings, our experimental data showed that the winter moth shortened the duration of their pupal development when they experienced a late spring photoperiod as a larva, and prolonged pupal development when experiencing early spring photoperiod. The effects of the larval photoperiodic treatments persisted during egg development in the following generation. The results show that a phenological shift that occurs during an early life stage is partially compensated during subsequent stages and suggest that the mechanism underlying this compensation is mediated by photoperiod. Winter moths regulated their phenology in such a way that the variation in the egg-hatching stage was not carried over to the next life cycle stages. This has strong effects on fitness as it (1) ensures the synchronisation of adult eclosion during the mating period and (2) is likely to reduce potentially negative fitness consequences of phenological mismatches in egg-hatching in the following generation. Overall, these findings stress the importance of understanding phenological carry-over effects to forecast the impact of global change in species with complex life cycles.

Forecasting vegetation dynamics in these environments requires a thorough understanding of how trees and grasses use and compete for key belowground resources. There is disagreement about the extent to which tree-grass vertical root separation occurs in these ecosystems, how this overlap varies across large-scale environmental gradients, and what these rooting differences imply for water resource availability and tree-grass competition and coexistence. To assess the extent of tree-grass rooting overlap and how tree and grass rooting patterns vary across resource gradients, we examined landscape-level patterns of tree and grass functional rooting depth along a mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient extending from similar to 450 to similar to 750 mm year(-1) in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We used stable isotopes from soil and stem water to make inferences about relative differences in rooting depth between these two functional groups. We found clear differences in rooting depth between grasses and trees across the MAP gradient, with grasses generally exhibiting shallower rooting profiles than trees. We also found that trees tended to become more shallow-rooted as a function of MAP, to the point that trees and grasses largely overlapped in terms of rooting depth at the wettest sites. Our results reconcile previously conflicting evidence for rooting overlap in this system, and have important implications for understanding tree-grass dynamics under altered precipitation scenarios.",,,,,"Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X",Andrew W.

Rehabilitation of these rangelands is challenging due to interannual climate and subseasonal weather variability that impacts seed germination, seedling survival and establishment, annual weed dynamics, wildfire frequency, and soil stability. Rehabilitation and restoration outcomes could be improved by adopting a weather-centric approach that uses the full spectrum of available site-specific weather information from historical observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and climate-change projections. Climate data can be used retrospectively to interpret success or failure of past seedings by describing seasonal and longer-term patterns of environmental variability subsequent to planting. A more detailed evaluation of weather impacts on site conditions may yield more flexible adaptive-management strategies for range-land restoration and rehabilitation, as well as provide estimates of transition probabilities between desirable and undesirable vegetation states. Skillful seasonal climate forecasts could greatly improve the cost efficiency of management treatments by limiting revegetation activities to time periods where forecasts suggest higher probabilities of successful seedling establishment. Climate-change projections are key to the application of current environmental models for development of mitigation and adaptation strategies and for management practices that require a multidecadal planning horizon. Adoption of new weather technology will require collaboration between land managers and revegetation specialists and modifications to the way we currently plan and conduct rangeland rehabilitation and restoration in the Intermountain West.

In pursuit of mathematical tractability, these models use simplified descriptions of key patterns, processes and relationships observed in nature. In contrast, ecological data are often complex, scale-dependent, space-time correlated, and governed by nonlinear relations between organisms and their environment. This disparity in complexity between ecosystem models and data has created a large gap in ecology between model and data-driven approaches. Here, we explore data assimilation (DA) with the Ensemble Kalman filter to fuse a two-predator-two-prey model with abundance data from a 2600+ day experiment of a plankton community.

This is particularly problematic when ecological models are used to make conservation and management plans whose outcomes may depend strongly on model formulation. Nonlinear time series approaches allow us to circumvent this issue by using the observed dynamics of the system to guide policy development. However, these methods typically require long time series from stationary systems, which are rarely available in ecological settings. Here we present a Bayesian approach to nonlinear forecasting based on Gaussian processes that readily integrates information from several short time series and allows for nonstationary dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling methods on simulated from a wide range of ecological scenarios. We expect that these models will extend the range of ecological systems to which nonlinear forecasting methods can be usefully applied.

The timescales of variability in the marine realm coupled with the extreme mobility of ocean-wandering species such as tuna and billfish complicates fisheries management. Developing eco-informatics solutions that allow for near real-time prediction of the distributions of highly mobile marine species is an important step towards the maturation of dynamic ocean management and ecological forecasting. Using 25 yr (1990-2014) of NOAA fisheries' observer data from the California drift gillnet fishery, we model relative probability of occurrence (presence-absence) and catchability (total catch per gillnet set) of broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius in the California Current System. Using freely available environmental data sets and open source software, we explore the physical drivers of regional swordfish distribution. Comparing models built upon remotely sensed data sets with those built upon a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we explore trade-offs in model construction, and address how physical data can affect predictive performance and operational capacity. Swordfish catchability was found to be highest in deeper waters (>1,500m) with surface temperatures in the 14-20 degrees C range, isothermal layer depth (ILD) of 20-40 m, positive sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, and during the new moon (<20% lunar illumination). We observed a greater influence of mesoscale variability (SSH, wind speed, isothermal layer depth, eddy kinetic energy) in driving swordfish catchability (total catch) than was evident in predicting the relative probability of presence (presence-absence), confirming the utility of generating spatiotemporally dynamic predictions. Data-assimilative ROMS circumvent the limitations of satellite remote sensing in providing physical data fields for species distribution models (e.g., cloud cover, variable resolution, subsurface data), and facilitate broad-scale prediction of dynamic species distributions in near real time.",,,,"Scales, Kylie/L-9318-2018","Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956",NASA 440 Earth Science Division/Applied Sciences Program's ROSES A.36 Ecological Forecasting Grant [NNH12ZDA001N-ECOF],"Funding for this work was supplied through a multi-year NASA 440 Earth Science Division/Applied Sciences Program's ROSES-2012 A.36 Ecological Forecasting Grant (NNH12ZDA001N-ECOF).

Unavoidable uncertainty in making predictions stems from errors and fluctuations associated with making measurements, and also from the complexity of the dynamics themselves. To be predicted, the time series have to contain some kind of repeatability, which can be exploited in the course of forecasting. In particular, even irregular time series are often characterized by the repeatability that implies fuzzy recurrences of the states of the system under study. Recently, the recurrence quantification analysis was used in order to assess numerically the horizon of predictability of chaotic fluctuations of the phytoplankton abundance in the Naroch Lakes system consisting of three reservoirs, Lake Naroch, Lake Myastro and Lake Batorino (Medvinsky et al., 2015. Chaos far away from the edge of chaos: A recurrence quantification analysis of plankton time series. Ecol. Complex., 23, 61-67). Here, we present the results of the analysis of the dynamics of bacterioplankton populations, which inhabit the Naroch Lakes. We demonstrate that the dynamics are chaotic. The horizons of predictability of the bacterioplankton dynamics are shown to be equal to 4.8 months for Small Stretch of Lake Naroch, 4.6 months for Large Stretch of Lake Naroch, 4.7 months for Lake Myastro, and 3.4 months for Lake Batorino. Chaoticity of fluctuations in population abundance can be either an immanent feature of the dynamics or be related to environmental influences. In order to evaluate the action of changes in the environment on plankton dynamics, we assessed numerically the extent to which chaotic fluctuations of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundances in the Naroch Lakes were synchronized with temperature oscillations. With the use of the analysis of phase relations between bacterioplankton and temperature time series we show that the chaotic bacterioplankton oscillations are synchronized with water temperature oscillations, while chaotic fluctuations of the phytoplankton abundance are not synchronized with the temperature oscillations in Lake Naroch and Lake Myastro in contrast to the phytoplankton fluctuations in Lake Batorino, the smallest of the Naroch Lakes, where phytoplankton fluctuations are phase-locked by the temperature oscillations. We conclude that temperature is the factor that has significant impact on predictability of the bacterioplankton fluctuations, while dynamics and predictability of phytoplankton dynamics can apparently be controlled not only by the temperature but also by trophic interactions and nutrient supply.

It is therefore important to determine the factors that the individual species depend on in order to understand their decline. The landscape changes have also resulted in habitat fragmentation, turning once continuous populations into metapopulations. It is thus increasingly important to estimate both the number of individuals it takes to create a genetically viable population and the population trend. Here, population viability analysis and habitat suitability modeling were used to estimate population viability and future prospects across Europe of the Little Owl Athene noctua, a widespread species associated with agricultural landscapes. The results show a high risk of population declines over the coming 100years, especially toward the north of Europe, whereas populations toward the southeastern part of Europe have a greater probability of persistence. In order to be considered genetically viable, individual populations must count 1,000-30,000 individuals. As Little Owl populations of several countries count <30,000, and many isolated populations in northern Europe count <1,000 individuals, management actions resulting in exchange of individuals between populations or even countries are probably necessary to prevent losing <1% genetic diversity over a 100-year period. At a continental scale, a habitat suitability analysis suggested Little Owl to be affected positively by increasing temperatures and urban areas, whereas an increased tree cover, an increasing annual rainfall, grassland, and sparsely vegetated areas affect the presence of the owl negatively. However, the low predictive power of the habitat suitability model suggests that habitat suitability might be better explained at a smaller scale.",,,,"Andersen, Line/T-6696-2018; Loeschcke, Volker/J-2527-2013; Sunde, Peter/E-9132-2013; Pertoldi, Cino/I-1746-2012","Andersen, Line/0000-0003-4001-0046; Loeschcke, Volker/0000-0003-1450-0754; Sunde, Peter/0000-0002-7485-037X; Pertoldi, Cino/0000-0002-4644-8981; Pellegrino, Irene/0000-0002-5683-3576",Aalborg Zoo Conservation Foundation [02-15],"Aalborg Zoo Conservation Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 02-15",,,0,0,3,21,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

If migration fails to keep pace with climate change, as models predict, the most suitable sources for restoration may not occur locally at all. To address this issue, we propose a strategy of prestoration: utilizing species in restoration for which a site represents suitable habitat now and into the future. Using the Colorado Plateau, United States, as a case study, we assess the ability of grass species currently used regionally in restoration to persist into the future using projections of ecological niche models (or climate envelope models) across a suite of climate change scenarios. We then present a technique for identifying new species that best compensate for future losses of suitable habitat by current target species. We found that the current suite of species, selected by a group of experts, is predicted to perform reasonably well in the short term, but that losses of prestorable habitat by mid-century would approach 40%. Using an algorithm to identify additional species, we found that fewer than 10 species could compensate for nearly all of the losses incurred by the current target species.

Although theory predicts that species combining high fecundity and dispersal with early maturation should spread the fastest, possible correlations between these traits greatly complicate predictions of species' relative spread velocity. We asked whether the demographic and dispersal rates controlling plant population spread are correlated across species, and which observed association of these traits leads to the fastest spread. Location: Worldwide. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Eighty species of herbaceous and woody plants from 35 families and 64 genera. Methods: We examined the relationships between age at maturity, dispersal and fecundity for 80 plant species, ranging from annual herbs to trees. We incorporated these rates into a model predicting spread velocities, in order to estimate species' spread capacity as a function of their life history. Results: Across species, age at maturity was positively associated with both dispersal and fecundity. Given that these traits have opposing effects on spread, our models predict that species widely spaced along an age-at-maturity gradient should spread at comparable rates. This result was driven by variation between rather than within life-forms; the traits controlling spread were not correlated within annual herbs, perennial herbs or trees. The predicted spread velocities for these plant life-forms overlapped considerably, although on average, trees were predicted to spread faster than herbaceous species. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that very different plant life histories allow for similar rates of biological invasion or native species migration under climate change. Determining where species fall within the correlated suite of traits controlling spread might provide the most effective way to predict relative spread velocities.",,,,"Lustenhouwer, Nicky/I-6981-2019; Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Lustenhouwer, Nicky/0000-0002-5157-857X; Moran, Emily/0000-0003-4624-1910",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_141025]; UC Merced,"Swiss National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_141025; UC Merced",,,9,9,1,19,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

We provide an updated list of the 72 species of Saturniidae moths collected on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, during the period 1958-2016. This list will serve as baseline data for assessing long-term changes of saturniids on BCI in the future, as 81% of the species can be identified by their unique DNA Barcode Index Number, including four cryptic species not yet formally described. A local species pool of 60 + species breeding on BCI appears plausible, but more cryptic species may be discovered in the future. We use monitoring data obtained by light trapping to analyze recent population trends on BCI for saturniid species that were relatively common during 2009-2016, a period representing >30 saturniid generations. The abundances of 11 species, of 14 tested, could be fitted to significant time-series models. While the direction of change in abundance was uncertain for most species, two species showed a significant increase over time, and forecast models also suggested continuing increases for most species during 2017-2018, as compared to the 2009 base year. Peaks in saturniid abundance were most conspicuous during El Nino and La Nina years. In addition to a species-specific approach, we propose a reproducible functional classification based on five functional traits to analyze the responses of species sharing similar functional attributes in a fluctuating climate.

We searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields and collected information about modeling approaches, target variables of prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the more predictive fields proficiency is evaluated in different ways. Both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology.

Intertidal habitats must maintain their surface elevations with respect to sea level to persist via vertical growth or landward retreat, but projected rates of sea-level rise may exceed the accretion rates of many biogenic habitats. While considerable attention is focused on climate change over centennial timescales, relative sea level also fluctuates dramatically (10-30cm) over month-to-year timescales due to interacting oceanic and atmospheric processes. To assess the response of oyster-reef (Crassostrea virginica) growth to interannual variations in mean sea level (MSL) and improve long-term forecasts of reef response to rising seas, we monitored the morphology of constructed and natural intertidal reefs over 5years using terrestrial lidar. Timing of reef scans created distinct periods of high and low relative water level for decade-old reefs (n=3) constructed in 1997 and 2000, young reefs (n=11) constructed in 2011 and one natural reef (approximately 100years old). Changes in surface elevation were related to MSL trends. Decade-old reefs achieved 2cm/year growth, which occurred along higher elevations when MSL increased. Young reefs experienced peak growth (6.7cm/year) at a lower elevation that coincided with a drop in MSL. The natural reef exhibited considerable loss during the low MSL of the first time step but grew substantially during higher MSL through the second time step, with growth peaking (4.3cm/year) at MSL, reoccupying the elevations previously lost. Oyster reefs appear to be in dynamic equilibrium with short-term (month-to-year) fluctuations in sea level, evidencing notable resilience to future changes to sea level that surpasses other coastal biogenic habitat types. These growth patterns support the presence of a previously defined optimal growth zone that shifts correspondingly with changes in MSL, which can help guide oyster-reef conservation and restoration.",,,,,"Rodriguez, Antonio/0000-0002-8007-1292","Albemarle-Pamlico National Estuary Program [3145]; North Carolina Sea Grant [2010-0974-12/R12-HCE-6]; North Carolina Marine Resources Fund [2012H005/4487, 2015H-042/6442]; Coastal Research Fellowship Program [R/MG-1315]; North Carolina Coastal Reserves","Albemarle-Pamlico National Estuary Program, Grant/Award Number: #3145; North Carolina Sea Grant, Grant/Award Number: 2010-0974-12/R12-HCE-6; North Carolina Marine Resources Fund, Grant/Award Number: 2012H005/4487 and 2015H-042/6442; Coastal Research Fellowship Program, Grant/Award Number: R/MG-1315; North Carolina Coastal Reserves",,,4,4,5,19,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We forecast the risk-reduction benefits to natural landscapes of lowering business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions by comparing the extent and spatial patterns of climate exposure to dominant vegetation under current emissions trajectories (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5) and envisioned Paris Accord target emissions (RCP4.5). This comparison allows us to assess the ecosystem value of reaching targets to keep global temperature warming under 2 degrees C. Using 350,719 km(2) of natural lands in California, USA, and the mapped extents of 30 vegetation types, we identify each type's current bioclimatic envelope by the frequency with which it occupies current climate conditions. We then map the trajectory of each pixel's climate under the four climate futures to quantify areas expected to fall within, become marginal to (outside a 95% probability contour), or move beyond their current climate conditions by the end of the 21st century. In California, these four future climates represent temperature increases of 1.9-4.5 degrees C and a -24.8 to +22.9% change in annual precipitation by 2100. From 158,481 to 196,493 km(2) (45-56%) of California's natural vegetation is predicted to become highly climatically stressed under current emission levels (RCP8.5) under the drier and wetter global climate models, respectively. Vegetation in three California ecoregions critical to human welfare, southwestern CA, the Great Valley, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, becomes >50% impacted, including 68% of the lands around Los Angeles and San Diego. However, reducing emissions to RCP4.5 levels reduces statewide climate exposure risk by 86,382-99,726 km(2). These projections are conservative baseline estimates because they do not account for amplified drought-related mortality, fires, and beetle outbreaks that have been observed during the current five-year drought.

Of particular significance for lakes are severe storms that can influence biogeochemical processes and biological communities by disrupting the vertical thermal structure during periods of stratification. An exceptional storm passing over northern Germany in July 2011 provided an opportunity to assess the consequences and underlying mechanisms of such extreme events on the interplay between the physics and ecological characteristics of a deep, nutrient-poor lake. Wind speeds were among the most extreme on record. A suite of variables measured throughout the event consistently indicates that a cascade of processes pushed the clear-water lake into an exceptionally turbid state. Specifically, thermocline deepening by the storm-entrained cyanobacteria of a deep chlorophyll maximum located at about 8 m depth into the surface mixed layer. Released from light limitation, intense photosynthesis of the cyanobacteria boosted primary production, increased algal biomass, raised the pH and thus induced massive calcite precipitation to a level never observed within three decades of lake monitoring. As a consequence, water transparency dropped from 6.5 to 2.1 m, the minimum on record for 40 years, and the euphotic zone shrank by about 8 m for several weeks. These results show that cyanobacterial blooms not only are promoted by climate warming, but can also be triggered by extreme storms. Clear-water lakes developing a deep chlorophyll maximum appear to be particularly at risk in the future, if such events become more intense or frequent.",,,,"Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Padisak, Judit/B-4514-2008","Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; Padisak, Judit/0000-0001-8285-2896",Federal Ministry of Research and Education; Leibniz Association,"We appreciate the excellent support by M.

An alarming finding for biodiversity is that global warming and pesticides often interact synergistically. Yet, this synergism may not capture the full picture because two counteracting processes may reduce the higher impact of pesticides under warming: higher pesticide degradation in the environment and thermal adaptation of populations. 2. We tested for the effects of warming and multiple pulses of the insecticide chlorpyrifos on life history and fitness-related physiological traits in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. To assess whether thermal adaptation is able to mitigate the impact of the pesticide under future warming, we exposed replicated populations from a colder, high latitude and from a warmer, low latitude in a common garden rearing experiment at 20 and 24 degrees C (the respective mean summer water temperatures at both latitudes). 3. At the higher temperature pesticide degradation was higher, leading to less accumulation after multiple pulses compared to the lower temperature. Accordingly, the pesticide caused less mortality and less oxidative damage at the higher temperature. This contradicts the general belief (based on studies that kept pesticide concentrations constant) of a higher impact of pesticides under warming. Furthermore, the reduction of the impact of the pesticide at the higher temperature was more pronounced in the warm-adapted low-latitude populations, indicating a counteracting role of thermal adaptation. 4. Policy implications. Our findings provide proof-of-principle for two key insights that will allow improving ecological risk assessment of pesticides under global warming: (i) higher pesticide degradation in the environment under warming may temper the impact of multiple pesticide pulses; (ii) gradual thermal evolution may further reduce the impact of pesticides at high latitudes under global warming. This knowledge can be very important for policy makers to arrive at a more realistic forecasting of the impacts of chemical pollution and climate change interactions on organisms.",,,,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020; Olsen, Kent/AAI-1228-2019","Olsen, Kent/0000-0002-5624-128X; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459; Verheyen, Julie/0000-0001-7496-5137; Op de Beeck, Lin/0000-0002-5385-2683","FWOFWO [G.0704.13, G.0524.17]; KU Leuven Excellence Center [PF/2010/07]","We thank Nicholas Bell, Ulf Norling, Frank Johansson, Philippe Lambret, Vincent Lemoine and Sarah Oexle for collecting damselfly eggs and Matthias Liess, an anonymous reviewer and the Associate Editor for constructive comments.

Collisions of large soaring raptors with wind turbines and other infrastructures represent a growing conservation concern. We describe a way to leverage knowledge about raptor soaring behaviour to forecast the probability that raptors fly in the rotor-swept zone. Soaring raptors are theoretically expected to select energy sources (uplift) optimally, making their flight height dependent on uplift conditions. This approach can be used to forecast collision hazard when planning or operating wind farms. Empirical investigations of the factors influencing flight height have, however, so far been hindered by observation error. 2. We propose a two-pronged approach. First, we fitted state-space models to z-axis GPS tracking data to filter heavy-tailed observation error and estimate the relationship between vertical movement parameters and weather variables describing the energy landscape (thermal and orographic uplift potential). Second, we fitted a mechanistic model of flight height above ground based on aerodynamics and resource selection theories. The approach was replicated for five GPS-tracked Andean condors Vultur gryphus, eight griffon vultures Gyps fulvus, and six golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos. 3. In all individuals, movement parameters correlated with thermal uplift potential in the expected direction. In all species, collision hazard was lowest for high thermal uplift potential values. Species specificities in the presence of a peak in collision hazard for medium values of thermal uplift potential could be explained by differences in wing loading and aspect ratio. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our fitted models convert weather data (thermal uplift potential) into a prediction of collision hazard (probability to fly in the rotor-swept zone), making it possible to prioritize different wind development projects with respect to the relative hazard they would pose to raptors. However, our model should be combined with post-construction monitoring to document, and eventually account for turbine avoidance behaviours in collision rate predictions.",,,,"PERON, Guillaume/C-5379-2013; Duriez, Olivier/R-4772-2016; Calabrese, Justin/B-9131-2012; Safi, Kamran/B-2079-2008","PERON, Guillaume/0000-0002-6311-4377; Duriez, Olivier/0000-0003-1868-9750; Calabrese, Justin/0000-0003-0575-6408; Safi, Kamran/0000-0002-8418-6759; Shepard, Emily/0000-0001-7325-6398; LAMBERTUCCI, SERGIO/0000-0002-2624-2185","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCYT-FONCYT, Argentina)ANPCyTFONCyT [PICT(BID) 0725- 2014]; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-07-BLAN-0201]; US NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ABI-1458748]; Smithsonian Institution CGPS; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution","The condor study was funded by Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCYT-FONCYT, PICT(BID) 0725- 2014, Argentina).

With this in mind, we conducted a mark recapture study on Coryphospingus pileatus in the Brazilian Caatinga. We applied Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Robust Design models to test the influence of sex, precipitation, drought and vegetation on demographic parameters. We found that the apparent annual survival of residents ranged from 31 to 49% in the first year and 65-77% in the second, depending on the area, sex and structure of the models used. Controlling for an effect of time since marking, survival was substantially lower in a year affected by a severe drought, and was higher at a site with more open vegetation structure. The results showed little variation in survival of the species during the regular annual dry season and a decline greater than 50% in apparent survival caused by severe drought. This suggest that in prolonged drought the drastic reduction of food directly affects the productivity, reducing in survival observed over time and projecting a critical perspective for endangered species that may disappear due to climate change.

We reviewed the literature that specifically links drought mortality to functional traits and site conditions (i.e. edaphic variables and biotic conditions), targeting studies that show clear use of tree traits in drought analysis. We separated the review into five climatic zones to determine global vs. regionally restricted relationships between traits and mortality. 4.

Predicting how increasing rates of global trade will result in new establishments of potentially damaging invasive species is a question of critical importance to the development of national and international policies aimed at minimizing future invasions. Centuries of historical movement and establishment of invading species may have depleted the supply of species available for future invasions, and it has been suggested that the problem of invasions will diminish as a result of this. However, the extent to which source pool depletion affects future invasions remains unclear. 2. Here we describe a mechanistic model that captures the simultaneous effects of depletion of source species pools along with increases in pathway rates (e.g. imports) to predict future numbers of new invasions. We assume that the distribution of species abundance within invasion pathways is positively skewed, which is modelled using a log-normal distribution. Given their high propagule pressure, the most abundant species are likely to invade first, while the many rare species are likely to invade only under high pathway volumes. We apply this model to the case study of bark beetle, Scolytinae, invasions in the USA. 3. Source species pools in Europe and Asia (225 and 655 species of Scolytinae, respectively) are much larger than numbers that have historically established (16 and 32). Parameterization of the model indicates a highly skewed species abundance distribution in the pathway and this is confirmed by species frequencies in port inspection records, thus explaining why only a small fraction of species has historically invaded. 4. Forecasts from the model indicate that with increasing rates of imports, more species from these regions are likely to invade in the future despite the depletion of the most abundant species from source species pools. Previous statistical models tend to underestimate future establishments in the presence of increasing import rates due to their failure to account for key underlying mechanisms. 5. Policy implications. The mechanistic model developed here is widely applicable for predicting future invasions of all taxa and provides insights into how increases in rates of imports counteract the species pool depletion effect, resulting in the continued establishment of new species.",,,,"Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/C-1528-2009","Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/0000-0002-5962-3208",'Better Border Biosecurity' collaboration via MBIE; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0553768]; University of California-Santa BarbaraUniversity of California System; State of California,"Partial funding was provided by the 'Better Border Biosecurity' collaboration (www.b3nz.org) via MBIE core funding to Scion.

Key questions in invasion biology include where will a non-indigenous species (NIS) establish, and how will it affect biodiversity? Scientists have addressed the first question, largely through correlating species' distributions with environmental factors (i.e. species distribution models, SDM). Conceptually, SDMs reflect a species' abiotic constraints, but in reality, they measure the realized rather than fundamental niche. This is a limitation of SDMs, but analysed correctly, it may also be a strength since SDMs already incorporate the outcome of species interactions. 2. We postulate that we can use the relative predicted probabilities of occurrences in each location from SDMs to predict the outcome of interactions between species. Based on this idea, we develop the Relative Suitability Richness (RSR) model, and generate two protocols to (i) assess theoretically whether we can predict the probability of establishment, and (ii) by conducting counterfactual analyses, the extent to which we can infer the impact of NIS on biodiversity. 3. Species distribution models based solely on abiotic factors have the potential to predict species establishment well, even when biotic interactions are strong. However, predictions improved with inclusion of biotic data, even with only partial information. Even with weak environmental predictors and no community data, macro-scale predictions could still be strong and one can estimate loss of native populations, as long as the fitting environment was representative of the prediction environment. If environmental conditions change, predictions were still possible so long as either good environmental predictors and/or biotic information was available. 4. Policy implications. Risk analyses are often recommended to guide management practices; they depend upon forecasting the likelihood and severity of an invasion. The Relative Suitability Richness protocols developed here predict non-indigenous species occurrences and impact, using even partial biotic data on native species occurrences, to provide key information needed to estimate invasion risk, prioritize management effort and advance invasive species policy.",,,,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC PGSD awardNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank K.

Using such models to predict distribution shifts under future environmental change may, therefore, produce biased projections. However, restricted-scale models have the potential to include a larger sample of taxa for which distribution data are available and to provide finer-resolution projections that are better applied to conservation planning than the forecasts of broad-scale models. We examine the circumstances under which the projected shifts in species richness patterns derived from restricted-scale and broad-scale models are most likely to be similar. Location: Europe. Methods: The distribution of butterflies in Finland, Belgium/Netherlands and Spain was modelled based on restricted-scale (local) and broad-scale (continental) distribution and climate data. Both types of models were projected under future climate change scenarios to assess potential changes in species richness. Results: In Finland, species richness was projected to increase strongly based on restricted-scale models and to decrease slightly with broad-scale models. In Belgium/Netherlands, restricted-scale models projected a larger decrease in richness than broad-scale models. In Spain, both models projected a slight decrease in richness. We obtained similar projections based on restricted-scale and broad-scale models only in Spain because the climatic conditions available here covered the warm part of the distributions of butterflies better than in Finland and Belgium/Netherlands. Main conclusions: Restricted-scale models that fail to capture the warm part of species distributions produce biased estimates of future changes in species richness when projected under climatic conditions with no modern analogue in the study area. We recommend the use of distribution data beyond the boundaries of the study area to capture the part of the species response curves reflecting the climatic conditions that will prevail within that area in the future.",,,,"Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009; Romo, Helena/B-2553-2019; Heikkinen, Risto K./AAN-6257-2020; Settele, Josef/A-6371-2009; Titeux, Nicolas/AAD-4439-2019; Munguira, Miguel L./L-5057-2013; Schweiger, Oliver/B-4909-2008; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Titeux, Nicolas/G-4723-2016; Wiemers, Martin/B-5715-2011; Maes, Dirk/B-1819-2009; Onkelinx, Thierry/H-6396-2013; Garcia-Barros, Enrique/L-2612-2013","Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Romo, Helena/0000-0002-5729-1342; Heikkinen, Risto K./0000-0003-4190-5108; Settele, Josef/0000-0002-8624-4983; Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417; Munguira, Miguel L./0000-0002-1554-4380; Schweiger, Oliver/0000-0001-8779-2335; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417; Wiemers, Martin/0000-0001-5272-3903; Maes, Dirk/0000-0002-7947-3788; van Swaay, Chris/0000-0003-0927-2216; Onkelinx, Thierry/0000-0001-8804-4216; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Garcia-Barros, Enrique/0000-0003-2804-9626","European Commission Framework Programmes via the Integrated Project ALARMEuropean Union (EU) [506675]; Integrated Project SCALES [226852]; Collaborative Project STEP [244090]; BiodivERsA Eranet Project CLIMIT; Collaborative Project EU BON [308454]; ERC Starting Grant TEEMBIO [281422]; Structuring the European Research Area Program, Lapland Atmosphere-Biosphere Facility [025969]","European Commission Framework Programmes (FP6 and FP7) via the Integrated Project ALARM, Grant/Award Number: 506675; Integrated Project SCALES, Grant/Award Number: 226852; Collaborative Project STEP, Grant/Award Number: 244090; BiodivERsA Eranet Project CLIMIT; Collaborative Project EU BON, Grant/Award Number: 308454; ERC Starting Grant TEEMBIO, Grant/Award Number: 281422; Structuring the European Research Area Program, Lapland Atmosphere-Biosphere Facility, Grant/Award Number: 025969",,,9,9,1,51,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

To decrease the cost of aquatic environmental in-situ monitoring and increase the accuracy of bloom forecasting, a traditional artificial neural network (ANN) based chlorophyll dynamics prediction model had been optimized. This optimization approach was conducted by presenting the change of chlorophyll value rather than the base value of chlorophyll as the output variable of the network. Both of the optimized and traditional networks had been applied to a case study. The results of model performance indices show that the optimized network predicts better than the traditional network. Furthermore, the non-stationary time series was employed to explain this phenomenon from a theoretical aspect. The proposed approach for chlorophyll dynamics ANN model optimization could assist the essential proactive strategy for algal bloom control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Models linking projections of environmental change with behavioral responses and bioenergetic effects can provide a basis for these forecasts. There is particular interest in forecasting effects of projected reductions in sea ice availability on Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Declining extent of summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea has caused Pacific walruses to increase use of coastal haulouts and decrease use of more productive offshore feeding areas. Such climate-induced changes in distribution and behavior could ultimately affect the status of the population. We developed behavioral models to relate changes in sea ice availability to adult female walrus movements and activity levels, and adapted previously developed bioenergetics models to relate those activity levels to energy requirements and the ability to meet those requirements. We then linked these models to general circulation model projections of future ice availability to forecast autumn body condition for female walruses during mid-and late-century time periods. Our results suggest that as sea ice becomes less available in the Chukchi Sea, female walruses will spend more time in the southwestern region of that sea, less time resting, and less time foraging. Median forecasted autumn body masses were 7-12% lower in future scenarios than during recent times, but posterior distributions broadly overlapped and median forecasted seasonal mass losses (15-34%) were comparable to seasonal mass losses routinely experienced by other pinnipeds. These seasonal reductions in body condition would be unlikely to result in demographic effects, but if walruses were unable to rebuild endogenous reserves while wintering in the Bering Sea, cumulative effects could have implications for reproduction and survival, ultimately affecting the status of the Pacific walrus population. Our approach provides a general framework for forecasting consequences of the broad range of environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances that may affect bioenergetics through behavioral responses or changes in prey availability.",,,,,,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; Changing Arctic Ecosystems initiative; USGS-BOEM Outer Continental Shelf program,"We thank the crews of the R/V Norseman II and all field personnel who assisted with offshore walrus tagging, and the community of the Native Village of Point Lay, especially M.

Recent studies suggest that intraspecific variation in melanin-based coloration reflects individual genetic-based alternative strategies to cope with environment variability, which could be crucial for their responses to climate changes. However, empirical evidence is still scarce. In this study, we tested how skin coloration in natural populations of brown trout Salmo trutta fario would reflect alternative reproductive strategies in different environments. We experimentally manipulated the flow regime (constant vs. variable) in artificial streams and compared the reproductive investment (body mass and plasma triglyceride variations), innate immunity (variations in plasma peroxidase and lysozyme activity) and reproductive success (number of mates and offspring) of differently colored brown trout over 2 reproductive seasons. Results show that darker males had a higher reproductive investment, but similar immune variations during reproduction compared to paler males. In addition, this reproductive investment was higher in variable environments. However, this did not translate into a higher reproductive success in variable environments, as darker males had a similar number of mates and offspring compared to their paler counterparts under a variable water flow. Since climate change will likely lead to an increased flow variability in the next decades, this suggests that darker brown trout could incur a higher energetic cost of reproduction and could be more impacted by climate changes than their paler counterparts.

Linear approaches are fundamentally based on correlation. Thus, they are ill-posed for dynamical systems, where correlation can occur without causation, and causation may also occur in the absence of correlation. ""Mirage correlation"" (i.e., the sign and magnitude of the correlation change with time) is a hallmark of nonlinear systems that results from state dependency. State dependency means that the relationships among interacting variables change with different states of the system. In recent decades, nonlinear methods that acknowledge state dependence have been developed. These nonlinear statistical methods are rooted in state space reconstruction, i.e. lagged coordinate embedding of time series data. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system but recover the dynamics from time series data, thus called empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). EDM bears a variety of utilities to investigating dynamical systems. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for EDM applications with rEDM, a free software package written in the R language. Using model examples, we aim to guide users through several basic applications of EDM, including (1) determining the complexity (dimensionality) of a system, (2) distinguishing nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems, and quantifying the nonlinearity (i.e. state dependence), (3) determining causal variables, (4) forecasting, (5) tracking the strength and sign of interaction, and (6) exploring the scenario of external perturbation. These methods and applications can be used to provide a mechanistic understanding of dynamical systems.",,,,"Ushio, Masayuki/F-8667-2010; Hsieh, Chih-hao/B-3797-2008","Ushio, Masayuki/0000-0003-4831-7181; Hsieh, Chih-hao/0000-0001-5935-7272","National Center for Theoretical Sciences; Foundation for the Advancement of Outstanding Scholarship; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), PRESTOJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST)","This work was supported by the National Center for Theoretical Sciences, Foundation for the Advancement of Outstanding Scholarship, and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (to CHH), and Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), PRESTO (to MU).

Climate change will likely have a major effect on these regions, but the consequences for faunal diversity and conservation remain unclear. To address this issue, we used an ensemble of eight species distribution models to predict future shifts and identify areas of high changes in species richness and species turnover for 201 mammals. We projected the distributions using two different climate change scenarios at the 2050 horizon and contrasted two extreme dispersal scenarios (no dispersal vs. full dispersal). Our results showed extended distributional shifts all over the country. For most groups, our results predicted that the current diversity of mammals in Ecuador would decrease significantly under all climate change scenarios and dispersal assumptions. The Northern Andes and the Amazonian region would remain diversity hotspots but with a significant decrease in the number of species. All predictions, including the most conservative scenarios in terms of dispersal and climate change, predicted major changes in the distribution of mammalian species diversity in Ecuador. Primates might be the most severely affected because they would have fewer suitable areas, compared with other mammals.

Trees are dominant species in many biomes and because they are long-lived, they may not be able to cope with ongoing climatic changes. Here, we coupled ecological niche modelling (ENM) and genetic simulations to forecast the effects of climatic changes on the genetic diversity and the structure of genetic clusters. Genetic simulations were conditioned to climatic variables and restricted to plant dispersal and establishment. We used a Neotropical savanna tree as species model that shows a preference for hot and drier climates, but with low temperature seasonality. The ENM predicts a decreasing range size along the more severe future climatic scenario. Additionally, genetic diversity and allelic richness also decrease with range retraction and climatic genetic clusters are lost for both future scenarios, which will lead genetic variability to homogenize throughout the landscape. Besides, climatic genetic clusters will spatially reconfigure on the landscape following displacements of climatic conditions. Our findings indicate that climate change effects will challenge population adaptation to new environmental conditions because of the displacement of genetic ancestry clusters from their optimal conditions.",,,,"Lima, Jacqueline/C-6348-2017; Collevatti, Rosane/D-8673-2013; LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./H-9503-2014; Ballesteros-Mejia, Liliana/AAC-4971-2019","Lima, Jacqueline/0000-0002-8342-0734; Collevatti, Rosane/0000-0002-3733-7059; LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./0000-0002-3322-1702; Ballesteros-Mejia, Liliana/0000-0003-2790-8652","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCAPES [88881.030318/2013-01, 88881.068425/2014-01]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [457406/2012-7]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: 88881.030318/2013-01, 88881.068425/2014-01; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 457406/2012-7; CNPq",,,5,5,3,91,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We extended an existing semiempirical modeling scheme that allows for such quantification. Yield anomalies, measured as interannual differences, were modeled for maize, soybeans, and wheat in the United States and 32 other main producer countries. We used two yield data sets, one derived from reported yields and the other from a global yield data set deduced from remote sensing. We assessed the capacity of the model to forecast yields within the growing season. In the United States, our model can explain at least two-thirds (63%-81%) of observed yield anomalies. Its out-of-sample performance (34%-55%) suggests a robust yield projection capacity when applied to unknown weather. Out-of-sample performance is lower when using remote sensing-derived yield data. The share of weather-driven yield fluctuation varies spatially, and estimated coefficients agree with expectations. Globally, the explained variance in yield anomalies based on the remote sensing data set is similar to the United States (71%-84%). But the out-of-sample performance is lower (15%-42%). The performance discrepancy is likely due to shortcomings of the remote sensing yield data as it diminishes when using reported yield anomalies instead. Our model allows for robust forecasting of yields up to 2months before harvest for several main producer countries. An additional experiment suggests moderate yield losses under mean warming, assuming no major changes in temperature extremes. We conclude that our model can detect weather influences on yield anomalies and project yields with unknown weather. It requires only monthly input data and has a low computational demand. Its within-season yield forecasting capacity provides a basis for practical applications like local adaptation planning.

Global change is threatening ecosystems and biodiversity world-wide, creating a pressing need to understand how climate and disturbance regimes interact and influence the persistence of species. We quantify how three ecosystem drivers - rainfall, fire and herbivory - influence vital rates in the perennial resprouting graminoid, Triodia scariosa, a foundation species of semi-arid Australia. 2. We used an 11-year dataset from a fire and herbivore exclosure experiment, to model flowering, post-fire recruitment and the post-fire survival of seedlings and resprouting plants. Regression modelling quantified the effect of rainfall, inter-fire interval, fire type (wildfire or prescribed fire), grazing by herbivores (native and feral) and an interaction between fire type and herbivory on T. scariosa populations. 3. Rainfall, fire and herbivory had significant effects on post-fire recruitment and the survival of seedlings and resprouting plants, including strong interactions between these drivers. Herbivory following wildfire had a minor effect, but in years of below-average rainfall herbivory following prescribed fire had a large effect, reducing the survival of seedlings and resprouting plants by 20% and over 50% respectively, relative to post-fire survival under average rainfall conditions. 4. Variation in rainfall underpinned significant variation in post-fire resprouting and seedling survival, thus we postulate rainfall primarily drives the dynamics of T.scariosa populations. 5. Synthesis. This study highlights the importance of modelling interactions between key ecosystem drivers when predicting how changes in global climate and disturbance regimes influence plant vital rates. Relatively small changes to disturbance regimes can substantially alter population processes, even in perennial resprouting species. This work suggests that conservation of foundation species, such as T.scariosa, will benefit if fire management decisions are better integrated with inter-annual weather forecasts and herbivore management.",,,,"; McCarthy, Michael/O-5655-2014","Giljohann, Katherine/0000-0003-1622-5821; McCarthy, Michael/0000-0003-1039-7980; Kelly, Luke/0000-0002-3127-3111",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council,"Collection of data was supported by Australia's Long Term Ecological Research Network and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.

In this study we contrasted performance of NDVI and EVI metrics obtained from Aqua and Terra, the two satellite platforms carrying the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, for estimating grassland cover measured at ground level on ninety-two 1 x 1 km blocks distributed from semidesert to high montane grasslands in the Sailugem Range of western Mongolia, where overgrazing and overstocking of domestic livestock are concerns for pastureland management. We also explored utility of late spring (May) vegetation indices for forecasting vegetation cover at the peak of the growing season (July). Vegetation indices developed using MODIS 1-km monthly data (MOD13A3 and MYD13A3) were strongly related to on-the ground field estimates of the percentage of vegetation cover in July (74-85% variation explained), with second-order polynomial regressions demonstrating better fit to the data than first-order regressions, Aqua vegetation indices (VIs) explaining slightly more variance than Terra's VIs, and NDVI performing comparably to EVI for both Aqua and Terra. Both Aqua and Terra VIs for May were highly predictive of July vegetation cover (R-2 = 0.80-0.84). We conclude that monthly MODIS NDVI and EVI datasets can be useful for rangeland managers in western Mongolia to monitor and predict summer pasture conditions at the regional level, where science-based guidance on grazing policy and practices is much needed.

Overutilization can cause lasting environmental damage, while underutilization can create unnecessary economic hardship for livestock operators. An improved ability to forecast vegetation stress later in the growing season would allow resource managers to better manage the tradeoffs between ecological and economic concerns. This research maps how well growing season conditions for vegetation within grazing allotments of Nevada can be predicted at different times of the year by analyzing 15 yr of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor, cumulative monthly precipitation, and the Palmer drought severity index. Land cover classes within the grazing allotments that are not relevant to grazing were removed from the analysis, as well as areas that showed N 50% change in EVI since these likely represented transitions or disturbances that were not related to interannual climate variability. The datasets were gridded at spatial resolutions from 4 to 72 km, and the correspondence between image and meteorological datasets was found to improve as measurements were averaged over larger areas. A 16-km sampling grid was judged to provide the best balance between predictive ability and spatial precision. The average R-2 of regressions between the vegetation index and meteorological variables within each of the 16-km grid cells was 0.69. For most of Nevada, the ability to predict vegetation conditions for the entire growing season (February-September) generally peaks by the end of May. However, results vary by region, with the northeast particularly benefiting from late-season data. Regressions were performed with and without very wet years, and the ability to make early predictions is better when including wet years than in dry to typical conditions.

Although researchers often predict species' distributions and productivity based on direct physiological responses to environments, theory suggests that striking shifts in community composition could arise if global change alters indirect feedbacks mediated by resources, mutualists, or antagonists. To test whether global change influences plant communities via soil-mediated feedbacks, we grew model communities in soils collected from a seven-year field manipulation of CO2, warming, and invasion. We evaluated mechanisms underlying variation in the model communities by comparing species' growth in equivalent soil histories with, and without, experimentally reduced soil biota (via sterilization) and nutrient limitation (via fertilization). We show that grasses performed consistently across all soil history scenarios and that soil biota limited grasses more than nutrients. In contrast, forbs were differentially sensitive to soil history scenarios, with the magnitude and direction of responses to soil biota and nutrients dependent upon plant species and global change scenario. The asymmetry in importance of soil history for grasses and forbs is likely explained by differences in life history strategy.

We apply this approach to study forest fragmentation in northern California, comparing the effects of cannabis agriculture - a booming commodity worldwide that affects diverse ecosystems - to those of timber harvest from 2000 to 2013. We found that although timber has greater impacts on the landscape overall, cannabis leads to far greater changes in key metrics on a per-unit-area basis. Thus, despite its small current land-use footprint, if changes are not made in the spatial pattern of its expansion, the boom in cannabis agriculture will likely create substantial threats to the surrounding environment.

Large outbreaks have been recorded through centuries, and the Food and Agriculture Organization keeps a long-term, large-scale monitoring survey database in the area. However, there is also a much less known subspecies that occupies a limited area in Southern Africa. We used large-scale climatic and occurrence data of the solitarious phase of each subspecies during recession periods to understand whether both subspecies climatic niches differ from each other, what is the current potential geographical distribution of each subspecies, and how climate change is likely to shift their potential distribution with respect to current conditions. We evaluated whether subspecies are significantly specialized along available climate gradients by using null models of background climatic differences within and between southern and northern ranges and applying niche similarity and niche equivalency tests. The results point to climatic niche conservatism between the two clades. We complemented this analysis with species distribution modeling to characterize current solitarious distributions and forecast potential recession range shifts under two extreme climate change scenarios at the 2050 and 2090 time horizon. Projections suggest that, at a global scale, the northern clade could contract its solitarious recession range, while the southern clade is likely to expand its recession range. However, local expansions were also predicted in the northern clade, in particular in southern and northern margins of the current geographical distribution.

Fluctuations in natural environmental conditions are ubiquitous and include for example variation in intensity and duration of temperature, droughts, parasite loads, and availability of nutrients, predators and competitors. The frequency and amplitude of many of these fluctuations are expected to increase with climate change. Tolerance curves are often used to describe fitness components across environmental gradients. Such curves can be obtained by assessing performance in a range of constant environmental conditions. In this perspective we briefly list theoretical and experimental evidence why results obtained under constant environmental conditions might be misleading for processes in nature and therefore may not be suitable for predicting fitness and future species distribution and abundance.

In this context, we analysed the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in West Greenland tundra (64 degrees N) across eight snow-free periods in 8 consecutive years, and characterized the key processes of net ecosystem exchange and its two main modulating components: gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco). Overall, the ecosystem acted as a consistent sink of CO2, accumulating 30 gCm(-2) on average (range of -17 to -41 gCm(-2)) during the years 2008-2015, except 2011 (source of 41 gCm(-2)), which was associated with a major pest outbreak. The results do not reveal a marked meteorological effect on the net CO2 uptake despite the high interannual variability in the timing of snowmelt and the start and duration of the growing season. The ranges in annual GPP (182 to 316 gCm(-2)) and R-eco (144 to 279 gCm(-2)) were > 5 fold larger than the range in NEE. Gross fluxes were also more variable (coefficients of variation are 3.6 and 4.1% respectively) than for NEE (0.7 %). GPP and R-eco were sensitive to insolation and temperature, and there was a tendency towards larger GPP and R-eco during warmer and wetter years. The relative lack of sensitivity of NEE to meteorology was a result of the correlated response of GPP and R-eco. During the snow-free season of the anomalous year of 2011, a biological disturbance related to a larvae outbreak reduced GPP more strongly than R-eco. With continued warming temperatures and longer growing seasons, tundra systems will increase rates of C cycling. However, shifts in sink strength will likely be triggered by factors such as biological disturbances, events that will challenge our forecasting of C states.",,,,"Tamstorf, Mikkel/AAB-6627-2020; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016; Lund, Magnus/J-4922-2013; Exbrayat, Jean-Francois/H-5645-2012; Hansen, Birger/E-5192-2015","Tamstorf, Mikkel/0000-0002-2811-331X; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Lund, Magnus/0000-0003-1622-2305; Exbrayat, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-3671-8626; Hansen, Birger/0000-0002-5440-6925; Christensen, Torben/0000-0002-4917-148X; Lopez-Blanco, Efren/0000-0002-3796-8408; Westergaard-Nielsen, Andreas/0000-0003-1021-0530","Aarhus-Edinburgh Excellence in European Doctoral Education Project; eSTICC (eScience tools for investigating Climate Change in Northern High Latitudes) project, part of the Nordic Center of Excellence; Danish Environmental Protection Agency; Danish Energy Agency","This work was supported in part by a scholarship from the Aarhus-Edinburgh Excellence in European Doctoral Education Project and by the eSTICC (eScience tools for investigating Climate Change in Northern High Latitudes) project, part of the Nordic Center of Excellence.

Forecasts for 2051-2060 of regional land use and climate for scenarios of low (B2) and moderately high (A1B) rates of change, coupled with multiple global circulation models (MIROC, CSIRO, and Hadley), were used to inform a distributed ecohydrological model. Our results identified increases in water yields across the study watersheds, primarily due to forecasts of increased precipitation. Climate change was a more dominant factor for future water yield relative to land use change across all land uses (forested, urban, and mixed). When land use change was high (27% of forested land use was converted to urban development), it amplified the impacts of climate change on both the magnitude and timing of water yield.

The implications of this framework are assessed conceptually and linked to classic questions in ecology, such as the relative importance of endogenous (density-dependent) vs. exogenous factors, stability vs. drift, and the spatial scaling of processes. The framework is used to make a number of novel predictions and reframe approaches to experimental design, model selection, and hypothesis testing. Next, the quantitative application of the framework to partitioning uncertainties is illustrated using a short-term forecast of net ecosystem exchange.

In these situations, biotic interactions may be particularly important for explaining and predicting the submerged macrophytes occurrence. Here, we evaluate the roles of biotic interactions in predicting spatial occurrence of submerged macrophytes in 1959 and 2009 for Dianshan Lake in eastern China, which became eutrophic since the 1980s. For the four common species occurred in 1959 and 2009, null species distribution models based on abiotic variables and full models based on both abiotic and biotic variables were developed using generalized linear model (GLM) and boosted regression trees (BRT) to determine whether the biotic variables improved the model performance. Hierarchical Bayesian-based joint species distribution models capable of detecting paired biotic interactions were established for each species in both periods to evaluate the changes in the biotic interactions. In most of the GLM and BRT models, the full models showed better performance than the null models in predicting the species presence/absence, and the relative importance of the biotic variables in the full models increased from less than 50% in 1959 to more than 50% in 2009 for each species. Moreover, co-occurrence correlation of each paired species interaction was higher in 2009 than that in 1959. The findings suggest biotic interactions that tend to be positive play more important roles in the spatial distribution of multispecies assemblages of macrophytes and should be included in prediction models to improve prediction accuracy when forecasting macrophytes' distribution under eutrophication stress.",,,,,"Pan, Yingji/0000-0002-8203-3943; Song, Kun/0000-0001-8019-9707; Xu, Kaiqin/0000-0003-0781-3031","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40971041, 31500355]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 40971041 and 31500355",,,0,0,2,38,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, modelling distributions of invasive species inhabiting stream networks requires due consideration of their dendritic spatial structure, which may strongly constrain dispersal and colonization pathways. Here we evaluate the application of novel geostatistical tools to species distribution modelling in dendritic networks, using as case study two invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus) in a Mediterranean watershed. Specifically, we used logistic mixed models to relate the probability of occurrence of each crayfish to environmental variables, while specifying three spatial autocorrelation components in random errors. These components described spatial dependencies between sites as a function of (1) straight-line distances (Euclidean model) between sites, (2) hydrologic (along the waterlines) distances between flow-connected sites (tail-up model), and (3) hydrologic distances irrespective of flow connection (tail-down model). We found a positive effect of stream order on P. clarkii, indicating an association with the lower and mid reaches of larger streams, while P. leniusculus was affected by an interaction between stream order and elevation, indicating an association with larger streams at higher altitude. For both species, models including environmental and spatial components far outperformed the pure environmental models, with the tail-up and the Euclidean components being the most important for P. clarkii and P. leniusculus, respectively.

The programme included a multi-year surveillance phase in a quarantine area. We developed a spatial decision support system (SDSS) to aid in effective and efficient allocation, tracking, forecasting, and reporting of these surveillance activities. We parameterised our SDSS with data collected by the CFIA during the treatment phase, and from existing policy, scientific and expert knowledge. The SDSS operated within a multi-loop adaptive management framework designed to foster four levels of organisational learning, analogous to the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom hierarchy, to address uncertainty in founding parameters. Increasingly complex feedback was escalated to higher levels of programme management for review, and then integrated into the SDSS for future implementation. Numerous enhancements were approved and implemented during both the SDSS development and operation because of organisational learning fostered by the system. Two basic forms of learning methods were used: visual pattern recognition within graphical SDSS outputs, and hypothesis testing through re-evaluation of founding precepts and parameters. The system successfully guided surveillance until pest-free status was declared nine survey-cycles later, the first four leading to the discovery of small, residual beetle populations.

Many marine invertebrates exhibit a biphasic life cycle: benthic adults and planktonic larvae, which inhabit different environments and may react dissimilarly to anticipated changes in climatological patterns. To date, SDMs applied to benthic species have only considered adult life-history stages. Here, we present the first study in which SDMs have been simultaneously developed for both the larval and adult stages of the same organism. Location The Southern Ocean. Methods Occurrence data for the study species, the Antarctic barnacle Bathylasma corolliforme, were sourced from: (1) benthic geo-referenced records from museum collections and online databases; and (2) observations of planktonic larvae identified with genetic and morphological methods. These records were used to construct two independent SDMs (adult-larvae) with Maxent 3.3.3k; their outputs were then projected to environmental conditions forecast for the year 2050 (IPCC scenario A1B). Results The two different SDMs had high predictive capability and identified preferred environmental conditions of each life-history stage. For the projected 2050 climate change scenario, SDMs predicted that the extent of environmentally suitable areas of both life-history stages was reduced, with planktonic larvae experiencing greater reductions and latitudinal displacement of their suitable areas. Main conclusions For multiphasic species, considering only a single life-history stage while studying distribution shifts may lead to erroneous conclusions for the species as a whole, regardless of the predictive capability of models employed. Ignoring the changes in suitable areas for larval stages can lead to underestimation of habitat reduction, distribution shifts, effects on population connectivity and potential for colonization of newly available habitats.",,,,"Sewell, Mary A/C-9017-2009; Gallego, Ramon/AAA-6840-2020; Lavery, Shane/C-2855-2012","Sewell, Mary A/0000-0002-1595-7951; Gallego, Ramon/0000-0003-4990-9648; Basher, Zeenatul/0000-0002-6439-8324; Lavery, Shane/0000-0003-3038-292X","New Zealand Government [So001IPY, IPY2007-01]; University of Auckland; Antarctic Science Ltd through the Antarctic Science Bursary; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","The financial support for this study was provided by the New Zealand Government under the New Zealand International Polar Year-Census of Antarctic Marine Life Project (Phase 1: So001IPY; Phase 2: IPY2007-01); the University of Auckland under the Latitudinal Gradient Project; Antarctic Science Ltd through the Antarctic Science Bursary and the NSF by funding the attendance of R.G. to the VertNet Biodiversity Informatics Workshop.

Yet, our predictive understanding of these changes is hampered by an over-reliance on simplified laboratory systems centred on single trophic levels. Using a large mesocosm experiment, we reveal how future ocean acidification and warming modify trophic linkages across a three-level food web: that is, primary (algae), secondary (herbivorous invertebrates) and tertiary (predatory fish) producers. Both elevated CO2 and elevated temperature boosted primary production. Under elevated CO2, the enhanced bottom-up forcing propagated through all trophic levels. Elevated temperature, however, negated the benefits of elevated CO2 by stalling secondary production. This imbalance caused secondary producer populations to decline as elevated temperature drove predators to consume their prey more rapidly in the face of higher metabolic demand. Our findings demonstrate how anthropogenic CO2 can function as a resource that boosts productivity throughout food webs, and how warming can reverse this effect by acting as a stressor to trophic interactions.

Climate model projections for the Baltic Sea forecast increased frequency and duration of extreme temperatures, together with declines in salinity, which are expected to have impacts on the biota. In this experimental study, the interacting effects of low salinity and short-term (8 days) extreme seawater temperatures, followed by an 11-day recovery period, on the foundational macroalga, Fucus vesiculosus, were investigated. To account for potential variation in the responses at local scale, individuals originating from two different local populations, a warm and a cold site were included. In experiments manipulating temperature (20 degrees C to 28 degrees C) and salinity (4 or 6), it was found that even an 8 day exposure to 26 degrees C or higher was detrimental to F. vesiculosus, causing extensive tissue necrosis. Tissue necrosis was enhanced by low salinity. Photosynthesis, measured as the steady-state electron transport rate (ETR) and maximum ETR, declined at 26 degrees C, and this effect was also enhanced by low salinity. Temperatures above 26 degrees C caused declines in light-limited photosynthetic efficiency (alpha), indicating direct physiological damage to PS II reaction centers. After 11 days of recovery, some photosynthetic parameters recovered in the 26 degrees C, but not in the 28 degrees C treatment. It is concluded that Baltic F. vesiculosus populations may be severely affected even by short-term (8 days) exposure to high seawater temperatures when combined with the synergistic effects of low salinity predicted for the future Baltic Sea.",,,,"Takolander, Antti/H-8878-2019","Takolander, Antti/0000-0002-9237-3765; Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631","Oskar Oflund Foundation; Societas pro Fauna Flora Fennica; LUOVA doctoral programme, University of Helsinki; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [257686]","We thank Nina Sipari for the mannitol analysis and Ella Pippingskold, Mari Vanharanta and Hanna Halonen for helping with collecting the specimens and conducting measurements during the experiment.

We reviewed the literature for negative effects of invasive species to bats and summarised threats according to four categories: predation, disease, competition, and indirect interactions. We identified threats of 37 invasive species to 40 bat species. Ten bat species were threatened by more than one invasion pathway. About 38 percent of cases are speculative and 18 percent circumstantial, many attributed to overlapping ranges, and most accounts do not quantify effects needed to forecast bat population impacts. Evidence of cat predation is frequently cited, constituting the greatest incidence of observational data. Other direct and indirect impacts were documented from goats, dogs, brown tree snake, rainbow lorikeet, rose-ringed parakeet, yellow crazy ant, giant centipede, palm, burdock, avian cholera, and white-nose syndrome. Circumstantial evidence suggests impacts by rats, stoats, coqui frog, common wolf snake, little fire ant, kudzu, and Lantana camara. Other impacts by giant centipede, yellow crazy ant, cats, goats, rats, and avian cholera are speculative, as are those from pigs, deer, white eye, common starling, house sparrow, rock dove, barn and little owls, brush-tailed possum, honeybee, wasp, phytophagous insects, tamarisk, Cinnamomum verum, and Tabebuia pallida. Over 60 percent of bat species reviewed are island-dwelling, corresponding with evidence indicating that most extinctions occur on islands and invasive species' impacts are worse for island than mainland populations. Although appreciable bat population reductions owing to invasive species are often unproven, invasions are likely to exacerbate effects of other vulnerabilities. Multiple invaders and synergistic interactions may ultimately lead to species losses. Managers should exercise the precautionary principle by taking action against non-native species when first detected, even if new species do not appear to be detrimental.",,,,"Welch, Jessica/B-7356-2018","Welch, Jessica/0000-0002-5987-6387",Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; endowment of the Nancy Gore Hunger Professorship in Environmental Studies at the University of Tennessee,"The authors thank Paul Racey, Fred Frick, Nancy Simmons, and Jerry Wilkinson for contributing personal correspondence.

A schematic map of the distribution of H. sosnowskyi in the valleys of big and medium rivers with georegistration and landscape description of each point of detection was created. General characteristics of spatial distribution were formulated; the vectors of invasion (anthropochoria, hydrochoria) and the most important factors determining the penetration of H. sosnowskyi into river valleys were identified. The data on H. sosnowskyi confinement to certain structural elements of the landscape of river valleys with definite geomorphological and soil characteristics were presented. It was shown that phytocenotic association of invasive species in natural and anthropogenic communities was associated with towpaths and basic banks in valleys of large and medium rivers. It was established that the banks of rivers formed by rocks with a high content of solid detrital material were most favorable for H. sosnowskyi invasion, and raw floodplains and abrasion sandy banks were unfavorable.

This study focuses on the demand for climate information among water users of the Inner Niger Delta, which are the rice farmers, herders and fishermen. In the Delta, productions are closely associated with the complex fluvial-rain system. Users need information about both the coming rainy season and the floods which are conditioned by upstream basins rainfall. The required information includes the onset of the rainy season, the onset of the flooding of the plains, the duration of this flooding; and the probable maximum heights of the flood. Nevertheless, a good production year is conditioned by high flood, long flood for plains submersion duration and late flood compared with the start of local rainy seasons. Adjustment of practices based on climate information ranges from mobilizing effective means for field preparation and location to the seeding time for farmers. For herders, the information determines livestock entry and exit from the delta, the herd size management and sanitary treatments. For fishermen, the adjustment relates to the starting time of his activities, gear, fishing effort and the choice of the fishing location.",,,,,,European UnionEuropean Union (EU),"This study was carried out in the framework of the AFROMAISON project funded by the European Union.

However, the plant species determining the ecosystem properties and plant community dynamics may not be the dominant, especially when it is exotic. Understanding plant community dynamics in ecosystems that are uncharacterized and/or affected by invasive plant species requires a data-driven approach and proper placement of monitoring plots. To generate robust datasets on vegetation change through time, monitoring plot placement must consider the scale of ecological variation for both vegetation and soils and plots would ideally be replicated within similar ecological site types to quantify the consistency of successional transitions. We characterized soil and vegetation across and within seven floodplains affected by Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.) along the Yellowstone River in southeastern Montana, USA. Using modern Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and multivariate net differentiation, we identified five distinct plant community types, or classes, characterized by their tertiary woody plant cover, not the primary species, Russian olive. Our findings indicate that Russian olive communities differ across space, and these riparian areas can be classified into distinct plant community types.

The capacity for specific habitat patches within a landscape to modulate stressors from extreme climate events, and animal distribution throughout habitat matrices during events, could influence the degree of population level effects following the passage of ECEs. Here, we ask (i) does the intensity of stressors of an ECE vary across a landscape? And (ii) Do habitat use patterns of a mobile species influence their vulnerability to ECEs? Specifically, we measured how extreme cold spells might interact with temporal variability in habitat use to affect populations of a tropical, estuarine-dependent large-bodied fish Common Snook, within Everglades National Park estuaries (FL US). We examined temperature variation across the estuary during cold disturbances with different degrees of severity, including an extreme cold spell. Second, we quantified Snook distribution patterns when the passage of ECEs is most likely to occur from 2012 to 2016 using passive acoustic tracking. Our results revealed spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of temperature declines during cold disturbances, with some habitats being consistently 3-5 degrees C colder than others. Surprisingly, Snook distributions during periods of greatest risk to experience an extreme cold event varied among years. During the winters of 2013-2014 and 20142015 a greater proportion of Snook occurred in the colder habitats, while the winters of 2012-2013 and 2015-2016 featured more Snook observed in the warmest habitats. This study shows that Snook habitat use patterns could influence vulnerability to extreme cold events, however, whether Snook habitat use increases or decreases their vulnerability to disturbance depends on the year, creating temporally dynamic vulnerability. Faunal global change research should address the spatially explicit nature of extreme climate events and animal habitat use patterns to identify potential mechanisms that may influence population effects following these disturbances.",,,,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003",National Science Foundation Water Climate and Sustainability grant [NSF WSC-1204762]; FCE LTER [NSF DEB-1237517]; Monitoring and Assessment Plan of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) through US Geological Survey; South Florida Water Management District; USUS Army Corps of Engineers,"National Science Foundation Water Climate and Sustainability grant, Grant/Award Number: NSF WSC-1204762; FCE LTER, Grant/Award Number: NSF DEB-1237517; Monitoring and Assessment Plan of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) through the US Geological Survey; South Florida Water Management District; USUS Army Corps of Engineers",,,14,14,6,58,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The consequences of such changes are typically most evident at the edge of a species' geographical distribution, where differences in growth or population dynamics may result in range expansions or contractions. Understanding population responses to different climatic drivers along wide latitudinal and altitudinal gradients is necessary in order to gain a better understanding of plant responses to ongoing increases in global temperature and drought severity. We selected Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) as a model species to explore growth responses to climatic variability (seasonal temperature and precipitation) over the last century through dendrochronological methods. We developed linear models based on age, climate and previous growth to forecast growth trends up to year 2100 using climatic predictions. Populations were located at the treeline across a latitudinal gradient covering the northern, central and southernmost populations and across an altitudinal gradient at the southern edge of the distribution (treeline, medium and lower elevations). Radial growth was maximal at medium altitude and treeline of the southernmost populations. Temperature was the main factor controlling growth variability along the gradients, although the timing and strength of climatic variables affecting growth shifted with latitude and altitude. Predictive models forecast a general increase in Scots pine growth at treeline across the latitudinal distribution, with southern populations increasing growth up to year 2050, when it stabilizes. The highest responsiveness appeared at central latitude, and moderate growth increase is projected at the northern limit. Contrastingly, the model forecasted growth declines at lowland-southern populations, suggesting an upslope range displacement over the coming decades. Our results give insight into the geographical responses of tree species to climate change and demonstrate the importance of incorporating biogeographical variability into predictive models for an accurate prediction of species dynamics as climate changes.",,,,"Matias, Luis/K-6761-2014","Matias, Luis/0000-0001-5603-5390; Sanchez-Miranda, Angela/0000-0003-4228-6425; Jump, Alistair/0000-0002-2167-6451",EUEuropean Union (EU) [FP7-2011-IEF-300825]; Juan de la CiervaInstituto de Salud Carlos III [FPDI-2013-15867]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2013-48843-C2-2-R]; TRANSHABITAT (European Union FEDER)European Union (EU) [0087],"We thank L.

We compared predictions from species and phenotype distribution models under future climate scenarios for Andropogon gerardii, a widely distributed, dominant grass found throughout the central United States. Phenotype data on aboveground biomass, height, leaf width, and chlorophyll content were obtained from 33 populations spanning a similar to 1000 km gradient that encompassed the majority of the species' environmental range. Species and phenotype distribution models were trained using current climate conditions and projected to future climate scenarios. We used permutation procedures to infer the most important variable for each model. The species-level response to climate was most sensitive to maximum temperature of the hottest month, but phenotypic variables were most sensitive to mean annual precipitation. The phenotype distribution models predict that A. gerardii could be largely functionally eliminated from where this species currently dominates, with biomass and height declining by up to similar to 60% and leaf width by similar to 20%. By the 2070s, the core area of highest suitability for A. gerardii is projected to shift up to similar to 700 km northeastward. Further, short-statured phenotypes found in the present-day short grass prairies on the western periphery of the species' range will become favored in the current core similar to 800 km eastward of their current location. Combined, species and phenotype models predict this currently dominant prairie grass will decline in prevalence and stature. Thus, sourcing plant material for grassland restoration and forage should consider changes in the phenotype that will be favored under future climate conditions. Phenotype distribution models account for the role of intraspecific variation in determining responses to anticipated climate change and thereby complement predictions from species distributions models in guiding climate adaptation strategies.",,,,"Smith, Adam B./H-6906-2019; Smith, Adam B/L-5111-2013","Smith, Adam B./0000-0002-6420-1659; Smith, Adam B/0000-0002-6420-1659",U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2008-3510004545]; Kansas Academy of Science; Alan Graham Fund in Global Change,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grant/ Award Number: 2008-3510004545; Kansas Academy of Science; Alan Graham Fund in Global Change.",,,10,10,2,37,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Location: North western Atlantic. Methods: We examined the interaction between maximum and seasonal elevations in seawater temperature and reproductive phenology of a global invader to forecast the effect of climate warming on traits associated with the spread and establishment (i.e., growth and reproduction) of an invasive species. We then coupled these data with a study of early succession along a temperature gradient to forecast invasion success in species assemblages across a range of latitudes. Results: Elevated seasonal temperature will lead to greater asexual reproduction and to multi-annual sexual reproduction in areas that currently have bi-annual or annual reproduction. The output from our model combined with our field studies of early succession in communities suggest that in colder environments, communities may be more affected by climate-induced shifts in reproductive phenology as they have more free space at the beginning of the growing season and fewer competitively superior species. Main conclusions: Predicted elevated water temperature will eliminate the thermal barriers that limit reproductive success of a cosmopolitan invasive species.

In this study, we identify and quantify the ENSO contribution to the eastern African rainfall variability to forecast future eastern African vegetation response to rainfall variability related to a predicted intensified ENSO. To differentiate the vegetation variability due to ENSO, we removed the ENSO signal from the climate data using empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT) analysis. Then, we simulated the ecosystem carbon and water fluxes under the historical climate without components related to ENSO teleconnections. We found ENSO-driven patterns in vegetation response and confirmed that EOT analysis can successfully produce coupled tropical Pacific sea surface temperature-eastern African rainfall teleconnection from observed datasets. We further simulated eastern African vegetation response under future climate change as it is projected by climate models and under future climate change combined with a predicted increased ENSO intensity. Our EOT analysis highlights that climate simulations are still not good at capturing rainfall variability due to ENSO, and as we show here the future vegetation would be different from what is simulated under these climate model outputs lacking accurate ENSO contribution. We simulated considerable differences in eastern African vegetation growth under the influence of an intensified ENSO regime which will bring further environmental stress to a region with a reduced capacity to adapt effects of global climate change and food security.",,,,,"fer, istem/0000-0001-8236-303X","DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); German Research Foundation (DFG) Graduate School programme [GRK1364]; BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LL1302A, 01LL1302B]","I.

Despite their wide application in ecology and conservation biology, the inference and projection of these models may be problematic when residual spatial auto correlation (SAC) is found. We aimed to improve the inference and projection of population dynamics models by accounting for residual SAC. We considered three Gompertz models that incorporated density dependence and the effect of wetland habitat to explain and project the abundance of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). We compared a conventional model that did not account for residual SAC (ENV) with two novel models accounting for residual SAC, one incorporating a spatial effect (a spatially autocorrelated process error) that did not vary over time (STA) and the other incorporating a spatial effect that varied over time (DYN). We evaluated model inference using data from 1974 to 1998 and projection using data from 1999 to 2010. We then forecasted Mallard abundance from 2011 to 2100 under different levels of wetland habitat loss. The DYN model eliminated residual SAC and had better model fit than the ENV and STA models (Delta(D) over bar = 2498.3 and 1988.8, respectively). The projection coverage rate of the DYN model was the closest to the nominal value among the three models. The DYN model forecasted smaller areas with decrease in Mallard abundance under future wetland habitat loss than the ENV and STA models. The novel and conventional population dynamics models we considered in this study, combined with the practical model evaluation approach, can provide reliable inference and projection of wildlife abundance, and thus have wide application in ecological studies and conservation practices that aim to understand and project the spatiotemporal variation of wildlife abundance under environmental changes. In particular, when conservation decision-making is based on model projections, the DYN may be used to minimize the risk of reducing conservation effort in areas that still have high conservation value, due to its favorable projection performance.

To avoid conflicts and reach an environmentally sustainable management, various methods have been devised to enable the participation of these actors. Mathematical modelling of river systems is highly recommended to forecast, but we do not always have enough information to do it. In these cases, the soft and meta-models can be valid alternatives to simulate these complex systems. The Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are presented as a tool that facilitates the modelling of ecological systems, functions and services. FCM networking concepts are intertwined through causal relationships. The FCM concept spatial arrangement and the use of fuzzy logic facilitate the integration of different expert opinions. In our study, from a panel of seven experts from representatives of different social sectors, an aggregated FCM was obtained. The most central concept in the aggregated map was cross barriers, dams and weirs. Using our FCM expert model, we performed a number of simulations from different possible scenarios, such as the continuous degradation of natural conditions and the improvement of river natural conditions. A regular increment in the natural conditions generates a substantial enhance in variables as natural water flow and sediment transport. Conversely, the increment in human activities as agro-forestry production addresses to a deterioration of river banks among other variables. In the Esla River, the FCM indicators showed an ecosystem that was greatly influenced by human activity, especially by the presence of barriers, in which the economic variables presented high network influence even though their centrality indices were relatively low. Meanwhile, the essential elements for the proper functioning of this ecosystem, as a natural flow regime, showed very low values that were visibly affected by anthropogenic variables. FCM methodology enabled us not only to understand the perception of current fluvial ecosystems but also to generate plausible management scenarios based on expert knowledge in this field.

Quantifying the severity of the issue and informing adaptation measures presents a challenge to ecological modelling. We undertook a study of biodiversity impacts and adaptation using spatial modelling across southeastern Australia. The study aimed to (1) forecast future impacts on biodiversity arising from 18 plausible climate futures, and (2) identify places where land management actions including revegetation will maximise expected improvements to projected biodiversity persistence. This work augments well-tested regional-scale biodiversity assessment by considering an uncertain future climate. Generalised Dissimilarity Models (GDMs) were developed at two baselines (1990 and 2000) to characterise the continuous nature of compositional turnover of vascular plants varying with climate, soils and landform across the region. The classified outputs of the GDM, representing a vegetation-based biodiversity surrogate, were projected using kernel regression to simulate changing distributions for the future epochs 2020, 2030, 2050 and 2070, referred to as Bio-climatic Classes (BCC). BCC distributions were combined with a model of current ecosystem condition and applied to a range of biodiversity assessment methodologies, including the Biodiversity Forecasting Tool, the Spatial Links Tool and a new coupled time-series metapopulation occupancy model. The BFT evaluation of the BCC distributions and their respective ecosystem conditions, forecasts a reduction in biodiversity persistence across the region of between 3 and 20 percent by 2070 (due to climate change only) adding to a past loss of 20 percent since European settlement (due to land use change only, not other factors such as weeds and pests). Maps of compositional dissimilarity change in vascular plants point to varying degrees of expected change in biodiversity across south-eastern Australia. Conservation benefit analysis indicates a general increase and re-distribution of the relative benefits of undertaking conservation to sustain or enhance biodiversity across the region. Results have been incorporated into novel visualisations, to assist environmental managers and others to interpret the complex concepts and issues associated with the work, and support regional adaptation planning.

In this study we evaluate the sensitivity of the near-surface atmosphere to a potential increase in shrub and tree cover in the northern Fennoscandia region. We have applied the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Noah-UA land surface module in evaluating biophysical effects of increased shrub cover on the near-surface atmosphere at a fine resolution (5.4 km x 5.4 km). Perturbation experiments are performed in which we prescribe a gradual increase in taller vegetation in the alpine shrub and tree cover according to empirically established bioclimatic zones within the study region. We focus on the spring and summer atmospheric response. To evaluate the sensitivity of the atmospheric response to inter-annual variability in climate, simulations were conducted for two contrasting years, one warm and one cold. We find that shrub and tree cover increase leads to a general increase in near-surface temperatures, with the highest influence seen during the snowmelt season and a more moderate effect during summer. We find that the warming effect is stronger in taller vegetation types, with more complex canopies leading to decreases in the surface albedo. Counteracting effects include increased evapotranspiration, which can lead to increased cloud cover, precipitation, and snow cover. We find that the strength of the atmospheric feedback is sensitive to snow cover variations and to a lesser extent to summer temperatures. Our results show that the positive feedback to high-latitude warming induced by increased shrub and tree cover is a robust feature across inter-annual differences in meteorological conditions and will likely play an important role in land-atmosphere feedback processes in the future.",,,,"Bryn, Anders/AAI-1991-2020; Stordal, Frode/R-6672-2017","Bryn, Anders/0000-0003-4712-8266; Stordal, Frode/0000-0002-5190-6473; Tallaksen, Lena M/0000-0002-8480-7842",Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo,"This work is part of LATICE, which is a strategic research area funded by the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo.

Egg and clutch sizes may thus vary in response to food availability prior to egg laying. We investigated the variation in egg and clutch size of black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla in a North Norwegian colony over a 33 yr period (1980-2012). Considerable interannual variation was evident in both egg and clutch sizes, but no temporal trends were observed. To identify environmental conditions explaining the variation, we modelled egg size and number in relation to the influx of warm Atlantic Water (AW) into the Barents Sea and to the abundance of 2 of the kittiwakes' most preferred prey species. Most of the variation was explained by the volumes of AW that flowed into the Barents Sea in winter and autumn. Both had a negative effect on egg investment. There was also a smaller, positive effect on egg investment of AW inflow (and capelin numbers for clutch size) immediately prior to egg laying. The negative impact of an increased influx of AW on kittiwakes may be partly due to the resulting warming of the waters, forcing a more northerly distribution of capelin beyond the foraging range of the kittiwakes at the colony or to changes at different trophic levels that are detrimental to kittiwake forage fish ecology.

Typically, these projections do not account for landscape connectivity and species dispersal abilities. When they do account for these factors, they are based on either rather simplistic or overly complex and data-hungry approaches. Here we apply a new approach for predicting species range shifts under different climate change and landscape connectivity scenarios that balances data requirements and output quality. The approach builds on the metapopulation concept to produce a dispersal model based on repeated simulations of stochastic extinction-colonization dynamics across multiple landscapes of variable connectivity. The model is then combined with an ENM to produce more realistic predictions of species range shifts under environmental change. Using the near-threatened Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) as a model species and considering two contrasting climate change scenarios (B2 and Al b) and three scenarios of increasing landscape connectivity, we confirmed that model predictions based solely on ENM overestimated future range sizes (2050 and 2080) in relation to predictions incorporating both future climates and landscape connectivity constraints. This supports the idea that landscape change critically affects species range shifts in addition to climate change, and that models disregarding landscape connectivity tend to produce overly optimistic predictions, particularly for species with low dispersal abilities. We suggest that our empirically-based simulation modelling approach provides a useful framework to improve range shift predictions for a broad range of species, which is essential for the conservation planning of metapopulations under climate and landscape change.

While climate change and ocean acidification (OA) will impact pelagic communities, their effects on sea ice microbial communities remain unclear. Sea ice contains several distinct microbial communities, which are exposed to differing environmental conditions depending on their depth within the ice. Bottom communities mostly experience relatively benign bulk ocean properties, while interior brine and surface (infiltration) communities experience much greater extremes. Most OA studies have examined the impacts on single sea ice algae species in culture. Although some studies examined the effects of OA alone, most examined the effects of OA and either light, nutrients or temperature. With few exceptions, increased CO2 concentration caused either no change or an increase in growth and/or photosynthesis. In situ studies on brine and surface algae also demonstrated a wide tolerance to increased and decreased pH and showed increased growth at higher CO2 concentrations. The short time period of most experiments (< 10 days), together with limited genetic diversity (i.e. use of only a single strain), however, has been identified as a limitation to a broader interpretation of the results. While there have been few studies on the effects of OA on the growth of marine bacterial communities in general, impacts appear to be minimal. In sea ice also, the few reports available suggest no negative impacts on bacterial growth or community richness. Sea ice ecosystems are ephemeral, melting and re-forming each year. Thus, for some part of each year organisms inhabiting the ice must also survive outside of the ice, either as part of the phytoplankton or as resting spores on the bottom. During these times, they will be exposed to the full range of co-stressors that pelagic organisms experience. Their ability to continue to make a major contribution to sea ice productivity will depend not only on their ability to survive in the ice but also on their ability to survive the increasing seawater temperatures, changing distribution of nutrients and declining pH forecast for the water column over the next centuries.",,,,"McMinn, Andrew/A-9910-2008","McMinn, Andrew/0000-0002-2133-3854",Australian Antarctic Science Grants programme; Antarctic Gateway Partnership,Australian Antarctic Science Grants programme and Antarctic Gateway Partnership are acknowledged for their continuous financial support for sea ice research in general and for this review in particular.,,,4,4,0,38,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,8-Sep,2017,14,17,,,,,3927,3935,,10.5194/bg-14-3927-2017,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000409818800001,,,,,

We conducted a multifactorial experiment to (1) disentangle the direct and interaction-mediated effects of environmental conditions and (2) augment our understanding of how environmental context modulates species interactions. We focus on a planktonic system where interactions with phytoplankton effect changes in the composition of bacterial communities. Further, light and temperature conditions can influence bacteria directly as well as through their interactions with phytoplankton. Epilimnetic bacteria from two humic lakes were combined with phytoplankton assemblages from each lake (home or away) or a no-phytoplankton control and incubated for 5 d under all combinations of light (surface, similar to 25% surface irradiance) and temperature (five levels from 10 degrees to 25 degrees C). Observed light effects were primarily direct, while phytoplankton and temperature effects on bacterial community composition were highly interdependent. The influence of temperature on aquatic bacteria was consistently mediated by phytoplankton and most pronounced for bacteria incubated with ""away"" phytoplankton treatments, likely due to the availability of novel phytoplankton-derived resources. The effects of phytoplankton on bacterial community composition were generally increased at higher temperatures.

J,"Wilson, P",,,,"Wilson, Page",,,An Arctic 'cold rush'? Understanding Greenland's (in)dependence question,POLAR RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Over the last decade claims that an Arctic 'cold rush' is taking place have intensified. Proponents of the argument contend that the unprecedented effects of climate change plus strong global demand for the region's natural resources are creating the conditions for a future economic boom. In both of these respects, Greenland merits particular attention. Some recent predictions suggest great riches accruing to Greenland, on account of its abundance of oil, gas and mineral deposits; as a consequence, some further argue, Greenlandic independence from Denmark is assured. In response, this article contests these arguments. For now, the natural and mineral resource sector in Greenland is tiny, and thus it is still much too soon to know whether it will even deliver the dazzling economic outcome forecast - let alone whether or not this outcome will benefit Greenland. In addition, the question of Greenlandic independence does not simply boil down to economics, but also raises various social, political, legal and strategic issues which are not easily resolvable. Consequently, Greenland's independence from Denmark is not simply a matter of time, but remains very much an open question.",,,,,,,,,,1,1,0,1,,,,0032-2474,1475-3057,,POLAR REC,POLAR REC.,SEP,2017,53,5,,,,,512,519,,10.1017/S003224741700047X,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,,,WOS:000413169400005,,,,,

Simultaneously, climate extremes like heat waves and droughts become more frequent. In the Free-Air Humidity Manipulation (FAHM) experiment in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. x P. tremuloides Michx.) stands in Estonia, we focussed on two questions how elevated humidity in high temperature and drought conditions influences soil greenhouse gas emissions, and what is the impact of tree species on greenhouse gas emissions. Soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured using the static chamber method in the 3rd and 4th years of humidification, in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Soil temperature, soil water potential (SWP), relative humidity, and precipitation were monitored; tree and understory growth, litter fluxes, substrate-induced respiration, and basal respiration were measured. During the severe drought in summer 2011 (SWP fell below 250 kPa), aspen stands had higher CO2 emissions than birch stands and humidification increased CO2 emission for both tree species. Generally, methane consumption was higher in control than in humidified conditions. Humidification reduced N2O emission in aspen stands in 2010. Hence elevated humidity, heat wave and drought, and tree species significantly affected soil greenhouse gas emissions, however CH4 and N2O fluxes remained small in all cases. The results of this study can be used to infer the future greenhouse gas dynamics from mineral soils in northern forests and to forecast growth conditions for energy forestry in changing climate.

Because of the high habitat diversity in Iran, a wide range of animal species can live in the country. However, there is lack of knowledge about biodiversity hotspots in Iran. In this paper, the terrestrial mammal, bird, and reptile species listed as threatened (i.e. near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered) at the global and national levels were studied. They included 18 mammal species, 26 bird species, and 7 reptile species. The biodiversity hotspots were identified using an ensemble forecasting framework based on MaxEnt model. The results indicated that 24% of Iran can be considered as the biodiversity hotspots out of which 10% are under protection. The results showed that large parts of Iran have potential to be considered as biodiversity hotspots. These areas were mostly located in northern Iran along the Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges; the latter stretches from northwestern Iran and spans the whole length of western and southwestern Iran. However, only a few of these hotspots are under protection. Therefore, it is essential to select new areas protected within biodiversity hotspots and to promote a network function of protected areas within these hotspots in Iran. Moreover, because of the few numbers of protected areas in Iran, it is important to conserve biodiversity outside the protected areas at least as buffers. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we explored consensus methods as a means of reducing uncertainty and improving model transferability in anticipating the potential distribution of an invasive moth (Hyphantria cunea). Individual native-range niche models were calibrated using seven modelling algorithms and four environmental datasets, representing different degrees of dimensionality, spatial correlation, and ecological relevance, and showing different degrees of climate niche expansion. Four consensus methods were used to combine individual niche models; we assessed transferability of consensus models and the individual models used to generate them. The results suggested that ideal criteria for environmental variable selection vary among algorithms, as different algorithms showed different sensitivities to spatial dimensionality and correlation. Consensus models reflected the central tendency of individual models, and reduced uncertainty by consolidating consistency across individual models, but did not outperform individual models. The question of whether interpolation accuracy comes at the expense of transferability suggests caution in planning methodologies for processing niche models to predict invasive potential. These explorations outline approaches by which to reduce uncertainty and improve niche model transferability with vital implications for ensemble forecasting.",,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31401962]; program of Using Three Years to Introduce More than One Thousand High Level Talents in Tianjin [5KQM110030]; Tianjin 131 Creative Talents Cultivation Project [ZX110204]; Talent Introduction Program in Tianjin Normal University [5RL127],"We are grateful to Prof. Paul Opler (Colorado State University) for sharing data and providing assistance with data from Butterflies and Moths of North America.

In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant-microbe interactions first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants. Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to experience climate change-induced range shifts. Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses. Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with elevation, but in C-3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation. Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were overrepresented by C-3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups.

Macroecology, which deals with biological patterns and processes at a large scale, is ideally suited to address this global phenomenon, thus providing a more general and generalizable understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. To date, a macroecological approach to examining phenological changes based on historical ground observations remains mostly unexplored, as the phenological studies have been conducted at local scales, while the recent new technologies, e.g., remote sensing, can extend phenological study to global scales. Because phenology is probably the most widely used bioindicator of climate change, thus allowing for studies at the macroscale. Some meta-analyses have indeed employed broad-scale, long-term datasets to estimate overall shift rates in the timing of plant and animal phenological events. However, none has provided a convincing macroecological view of current phenological shifts, and few attempts have been made to make global-scale predictions of phenological responses under future climatic scenarios. Understanding spatial variability and clines may be essential for comprehending phenological variations stemming from future climate change.

Expeditions to the SO provide useful data for improving global weather/climate simulations and understanding many processes. Some of the uncertainties in these weather/climate models arise during the first few days of simulation/forecast and do not grow much further. NCMRWF issued real-time five day weather forecasts of mean sea level pressure, surface winds, winds at 500 hPa & 850 hPa and rainfall, daily to NCAOR to provide guidance for their expedition to Indian sector of SO during the austral summer of 2014-2015. Evaluation of the skill of these forecasts indicates possible error growth in the atmospheric model at shorter time scales. The error growth is assessed using the model analysis/reanalysis, satellite data and observations made during the expedition. The observed variability of sub-seasonal rainfall associated with mid-latitude systems is seen to exhibit eastward propagations and are well reproduced in the model forecasts. All cyclonic disturbances including the sub-polar lows and tropical cyclones that occurred during this period were well captured in the model forecasts. Overall, this model performs reasonably well over the Indian sector of the SO in medium range time scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

Two key questions are: 1) how well do the fundamental thermal niches of ectotherms map to their realized thermal niches, and 2) which axes of the fundamental thermal niche must be modeled to predict temperature-dependent fitness in real ecosystems? The first question is particularly challenging in riverine systems, where gradients in temperature are strongly confounded by gradients in other biotic and abiotic drivers. To address these questions, we compared the realized and fundamental thermal niches of 2 congeneric riverine fish: Gadopsis marmoratus and Gadopsis bispinosus. We characterized their realized thermal niches by examining their distributions in relation to environmental temperature at multiple scales. We characterized their fundamental thermal niches by doing laboratory experiments on the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance and metabolic rates, particularly aerobic scope. The distributions of the 2 species supported the idea that they have different realized thermal niches, with G. bispinosus occupying cooler habitats than G. marmoratus. Despite this, we detected no significant differences in the shapes of thermal performance curves defining 2 axes of their fundamental niches: swimming performance and aerobic scope. Our results suggest that either the distributions of these 2 species are driven by factors other than temperature or that swimming performance and aerobic scope were not suitable proxies of their fundamental thermal niches. Our study shows that modeling the thermal niches of ectotherms along the river continuum is not straightforward. If we are to forecast effects of thermal futures effectively and efficiently, we must do more to decipher the relative influence of temperature and other abiotic drivers on the fitness of riverine ectotherms.",,,,,,VCF Holsworth Local Heritage Trust; CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship scholarship,"We are indebted to K.

However, local adaptation and biotic interactions also influence range limits and thus may impact range shifts. Despite the potential importance of these factors, few studies have directly tested their effects on performance at range limits. We address how population-level variation and biotic interactions may affect range shifts by transplanting seeds and seedlings of western North American conifers of different origin populations into different competitive neighborhoods within and beyond their elevational ranges and monitoring their performance. We find evidence that competition with neighboring trees limits performance within current ranges, but that interactions between adults and juveniles switch from competitive to facilitative at upper range limits. Local adaptation had weaker effects on performance that did not predictably vary with range position or seed origin. Our findings suggest that competitive interactions may slow species turnover within forests at lower range limits, whereas facilitative interactions may accelerate the pace of tree expansions upward near timberline.",,,,,"Ettinger, Ailene/0000-0002-6228-6732","UW Royalty Research Foundation; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-06ER64159]; UW Biology Department; George Wright Society; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0718124, DDIG-1010787, DEB Career DEB-1054012]","We thank I.

Here, for the first time, we investigate the impact of climate change on both presence/absence and abundances of hoverfly species. We used generalized linear models to analyse the relationships of climatic and soil variables with the occurrence and abundance of Cheilosia species on the Balkan Peninsula. Our results show that the ranges of all and the abundances of many species are projected to decrease in the future. Climatically suitable conditions for mountainous species are predicted to generally shift northwards. Species adapted to high mountains are projected to almost vanish from the Balkans and only regions of the Alps would remain suitable for them. We found climatic variables were more important in determining abundance than occurrence. Given that environmental factors differed in terms of their impact on abundance and occurrence, we highlight the importance of monitoring both parameters to ensure effective conservation. Considering the different projected responses of hoverflies to future climate change, as well as their value as pollinators and the increasing threats they currently face, knowledge on their responses to the major drivers of their life-histories is indispensable for proper management and conservation action. We reveal that nationally-designated protected areas are insufficient to conserve the species considered here, both currently and under projected climate change.

Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.",,,,"Hauenstein, Severin/AAE-9923-2019; Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013; Schroder, Boris/N-7250-2019; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/F-7461-2015; Lahoz-Monfort, Jose/O-3546-2017; Warton, David/B-5791-2009; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Schroder, Boris/B-7211-2009; Boyce, Mark/A-2620-2014","Hauenstein, Severin/0000-0001-8003-0944; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/0000-0002-8387-5739; Lahoz-Monfort, Jose/0000-0002-0845-7035; Warton, David/0000-0001-9441-6645; Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794; Roberts, David/0000-0002-3437-2422; Boyce, Mark/0000-0001-5811-325X; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHR1000/6-2]; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DO786/10-1]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT120100501, FT0991640, DE160100904, DP160101003]; Alberta Conservation Association (ACA - Grant Eligible Conservation Fund); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC CRD)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Shell Canada limited","DRR is supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

Ecosystem-based management requires predictive models of ecosystem dynamics. There are typically insufficient empirical data available to parameterise these complex models, and so decision-makers commonly rely on beliefs elicited from experts. However, such expert beliefs are necessarily limited because (i) only a small proportion of ecosystem components and dynamics have been observed; (ii) uncertainty about ecosystem dynamics can result in contradictory expert judgements and (iii) elicitation time and resources are limited. 2. We use an ensemble of dynamic ecosystem models to extrapolate a limited set of stated expert beliefs into a wider range of revealed beliefs about how the ecosystem will respond to perturbations and management. Importantly, the method captures the expert uncertainty and propagates it through to predictions. We demonstrate this process and its potential value by applying it to the conservation of the threatened malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) in the Murray mallee ecosystems of southern Australia. 3. In two workshops, we asked experts to construct a qualitative ecosystem interaction network and to describe their beliefs about how the ecosystem will respond to particular perturbations. We used this information to constrain an ensemble of 10(9) community models, leaving a subset that could reproduce stated expert beliefs. We then interrogated this ensemble of models to reveal experts' implicit beliefs about management scenarios that were not a part of the initial elicitation exercises. 4. Our method uses straightforward questions to efficiently elicit expert beliefs, and then applies a flexible modelling approach to reveal those experts' beliefs about the dynamics of the entire ecosystem. It allows rapid planning of ecosystem-based management informed by expert judgement, and provides a basis for value-of-information analyses and adaptive management.",,,,"Hauser, Cindy/B-4000-2008; Bode, Michael/P-1333-2019; Bode, Michael/A-7116-2009; Lahoz-Monfort, Jose/O-3546-2017","Hauser, Cindy/0000-0001-5876-0342; Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Bode, Michael/0000-0002-5886-4421; Lahoz-Monfort, Jose/0000-0002-0845-7035; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950; Baker, Christopher/0000-0001-9449-3632; Rumpff, Libby/0000-0001-9400-8086","ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [LP120100490, FT100100819]; Victorian Malleefowl Recovery Group; Parks Victoria; Iluka Mining; ARC DECRAAustralian Research Council [DE130100572]; National Environmental Research Program; National Environmental Science Program - Threatened Species Recovery Hub","We are grateful to the participants of the two expert workshops and their organisations.

In this study, we explore how information on demography (recruitment, growth and survival) and competitive effects in different environments and with different starting species abundances can be used to better understand resilience. We use observational and experimental data to better understand dynamics between native Stipa pulchra and exotic Avena barbata and fatua, grasses characteristic of native and invaded grasslands in California, at three different levels of nitrogen (N) representative of a range of pollution via atmospheric deposition. A modelling framework that incorporates this information on demography and competition allows us to forecast dynamics over time. Our results showed that resilience of native grasslands depends on N inputs, where natural recovery should be possible at low N levels whereas native persistence would be difficult at high N levels. Hysteresis was evident at moderate N levels, where the starting conditions mattered. Synthesis and applications. The resilience of both invaded and native grasslands is influenced by nitrogen inputs. Our modelling approach gives direction about how best to allocate limited management resources as baselines shift: where natural recovery is possible, where best to allocate active restoration efforts, and where native remnants may be most vulnerable.

It is therefore critical to understand when the influence of initial post-disturbance regeneration versus stochastic processes dominates long-term post-disturbance ecological processes. Often, conclusions about post-disturbance dynamics are based upon initial regeneration in the years immediately after disturbances. However, the degree to which initial post-disturbance regeneration indicates longer-term trends is likely to be contingent on the types, intensities, and combinations of disturbances, as well as pre-disturbance ecosystem structure and composition. Our relatively limited understanding of why initial post-disturbance regeneration is sometimes a poor predictor of future ecosystem trajectories represents a critical gap in post-disturbance ecological forecasting. We studied the composition and density of regeneration of tree species following wind blowdown in 1997, wildfire in 2002, and compounded disturbances by blowdown and wildfire in subalpine forests of Colorado. We examined regeneration of Picea engelmannii, Abies lasiocarpa, Pinus contorta, and Populus tremuloides in 180 permanent plots across 12 sites (classified by pre-disturbance age and composition) in 2003, 2010, and 2015. At sites that were blown down but not burned, regeneration was dense and dominated by Picea and Abies. At these sites, regeneration observed from 2003 to 2005 (hereafter initial regeneration) was also highly predictive of regeneration 5-10 yr later. In contrast, at sites that were burned and sites that were blown down and burned, regeneration was less dense and dominated by a mix of species. At these sites, initial regeneration was a poor predictor of longer-term trends as species dominance and overall density fluctuated over the 13-yr period. These findings call into question our ability to confidently predict ecosystem trajectories based upon observations made in the years immediately after large, severe disturbances such as wildfires and compounded disturbances. As compounded disturbances become more common under climatically driven changes in disturbance regimes, post-disturbance ecosystem trajectories may become increasingly stochastic and unpredictable.",,,,"Veblen, Thomas T./U-6461-2018","Gill, Nathan/0000-0003-1496-8197; Pickett, Steward/0000-0002-1899-976X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1262691, 1262687]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grants 1262691 and 1262687 and by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

Bycatch mortality from fisheries is clearly among the most serious global threats for marine ecosystems, affecting a wide range of top predators. Recent estimates report ca. 200,000 seabirds killed annually by bycatch in European waters. However, there is an urgent need to rigorously estimate actual mortality rates and quantify effects of bycatch on populations. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the most impacted regions. Here, we estimate for the first time both bycatch mortality rates and their population-level effects on three endemic and vulnerable Mediterranean taxa: Scopoli's shearwater, Mediterranean shag, and Audouin's gull, that die in different types of fishing gears: longlines, gillnets and sport trolling, respectively. We use multi-event capture-recapture modelling to estimate crucial demographic parameters, including the probabilities of dying in different fishing gears. We then build stochastic demography models to forecast the viability of the populations under different management scenarios. Longline bycatch was particularly severe for adults of Scopoli's shearwaters and Audouin's gulls (ca. 28% and 23% of total mortality, respectively) and also for immature gulls (ca. 90% of mortality). Gillnets had a lower impact, but were still responsible for ca. 9% of juvenile mortality on shags, whereas sport trolling only slightly influenced total mortality in gulls. Bycatch mortality has high population-level impacts in all three species, with shearwaters having the highest extinction risk under current mortality rates. Different life-history traits and compensatory demographic mechanisms between the three species are probably influencing the different bycatch impact: for shearwaters, urgent conservation actions are required to ensure the viability of their populations. Results will be very useful for guiding future seabird conservation policies and moving towards an ecosystem-based approach to sustainable fisheries management.",,,,"Genovart, Meritxell/L-4873-2014","Genovart, Meritxell/0000-0003-2919-1288; Igual, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-8369-3150; Kralj, Jelena/0000-0002-1500-5897",Regional Government of the Balearic Islands; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Spanish Ministry of Economy [CGL2013-42203-R]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [H2020-634495],"Regional Government of the Balearic Islands; European Social Fund; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Grant/Award Number: CGL2013-42203-R; European Union, Grant/Award Number: H2020-634495",,,11,12,0,35,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

How this is realized in 21st century remains uncertain, in large part due to limitations on plant migration and the impacts of landscape fragmentation. Understanding these changes is of particular concern for forest management, which requires information at an appropriately fine spatial resolution. Here we provide a framework and application for tree species vulnerability to climate change in the eastern United States that accounts for influential drivers of future distributions. We used species distribution models to project changes in habitat suitability at 800 m for 40 tree species that vary in physiology, range, and environmental niche. We then developed layers of adaptive capacity based on migration potential, forest fragmentation, and propagule pressure. These were combined into metrics of vulnerability, including an overall index and spatially explicit categories designed to inform management. Despite overall favorable changes in suitability, the majority of species and the landscape were considered vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability was significantly exacerbated by projections of pests and pathogens for some species. Northern and high-elevation species tended to be the most vulnerable. There were, however, some notable areas of particular resilience, including most of West Virginia. Our approach combines some of the most important considerations for species vulnerability in a straightforward framework, and can be used as a tool for managers to prioritize species, areas, and actions.",,,,"Goetz, Scott J/A-3393-2015","Goetz, Scott J/0000-0002-6326-4308",NASA Climate and Biological Response Program [NNX11AP66G],"This work was funded by the NASA Climate and Biological Response Program (NNX11AP66G) managed by Woody Turner.

Resolving thisunpredictability represents a major, but critical challenge to the science of restoration ecology. In an effort to move restoration ecology toward a more predictive science, we consider the key issue of variability. Typically, restoration outcomes vary relative to goals (i.e. reference or desired future conditions) and with respect to the outcomes of other restoration efforts. The field of restoration ecology has largely considered only this first type of variation, often focusing on an oversimplified success vs. failure dichotomy. The causes of variation, particularly among restoration efforts, remain poorly understood for most systems. Variation associated with restoration outcomes is a consequence of how, where and when restoration is conducted; variation is also influenced by how the outcome of restoration is measured. We propose that variation should decrease with the number of factors constraining restoration and increase with the specificity of the goal. When factors (e.g. harsh environmental conditions, limited species reintroductions) preclude most species, little variation will exist among restorations, particularly when goals are associated with metrics such as physical structure, where species may be broadly interchangeable. Conversely, when few constraints to species membership exist, substantial variation may result and this will be most pronounced when restoration is assessed by metrics such as taxonomic composition. Synthesis and applications. The variability we observe during restoration results from both restoration context (how, where and when restoration is conducted) and how we evaluate restoration outcomes. To advance the predictive capacity of restoration, we outline a research agenda that considers metrics of restoration outcomes, the drivers of variation among existing restoration efforts, experiments to quantify and understand variation in restoration outcomes, and the development of models to organise, interpret and forecast restoration outcomes.

However, its future impact on biodiversity remains unclear, especially because agricultural intensification is often neglected, and high path-dependency is assumed when forecasting agricultural development-although the past suggests that shock events leading to considerable agricultural change occur frequently. Here, we investigate the possible impacts on biodiversity of pathways of expansion and intensification. Our pathways are not built to reach equivalent production targets, and therefore they should not be directly compared; they instead highlight areas at risk of high biodiversity loss across the entire option space of possible agricultural change. Based on an extensive database of biodiversity responses to agriculture, we find 30% of species richness and 31% of species abundances potentially lost because of agricultural expansion across the Amazon and Afrotropics. Only 21% of high-risk expansion areas in the Afrotropics overlap with protected areas (compared with 43% of the Neotropics). Areas at risk of biodiversity loss from intensification are found in India, Eastern Europe and the Afromontane region (7% species richness, 13% abundance loss). Many high-risk regions are not adequately covered by conservation prioritization schemes, and have low national conservation spending and high agricultural growth.

In contrast, most cases of secondary extinctions from natural systems have been attributed to loss of entire top trophic levels. Here, we show that loss of single predator species in isolation can, irrespective of their identity or the presence of other predators, trigger rapid secondary extinction cascades in natural communities far exceeding those generally predicted by theory. In contrast, we did not find any secondary extinctions caused by intermediate consumer loss. A food web model of our experimental system-a marine rocky shore community-could reproduce these results only when biologically likely and plausible nontrophic interactions, based on competition for space and predator-avoidance behaviour, were included.

This has hampered attempts to model population growth and competition in dynamic environments, which is critical in forecasting species distributions, as well as the diversity and productivity of communities. To address this, we propose a model of population growth that includes a new formulation of the temperature-nutrient interaction and test a novel prediction: that a species' optimum temperature for growth, T-opt, is a saturating function of nutrient concentration. We find strong support for this prediction in experiments with a marine diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana: T-opt decreases by 3-6 degrees C at low nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. This interaction implies that species are more vulnerable to hot, low-nutrient conditions than previous models accounted for. Consequently the interaction dramatically alters species' range limits in the ocean, projected based on current temperature and nitrate levels as well as those forecast for the future. Ranges are smaller not only than projections based on the individual variables, but also than those using a simpler model of temperature-nutrient interactions.

Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One of the silvicultural treatments that has gained currency to lessen the impacts of climatic change is the reduction of stand density by thinning. However, we lack information on how the response of forest stands to different thinning treatments will be affected by climate change, and on the post-thinning temporal dynamics of water balance, specifically blue and green water. We adopted a modelling approach to explore the long-term effects of different thinning intensities on forest dynamics and water balance under climate change scenarios, coupling an individual-based model of forest dynamics (SORTIE-ND) with a mechanistic model of soil moisture dynamics and plant drought stress. We used as a case study three Scots pine plots across a gradient of climatic conditions, and we assessed the effect of site, three climatic scenarios and eight thinning intensities on tree growth, stand productivity, tree drought stress and blue water. The best thinning intensity in terms of stand productivity was obtained when between 20 and 40% of the basal area was removed, whereas the final stand stock rapidly decreased at higher thinning intensities. Moreover, the decrease in final basal area occurred at lower thinning intensities the drier the site conditions. Moderate and heavy thinnings (>30%) doubled basal area increment (BAI) of the following years in all the plots, although the effect vanished after 30-40 years, independently of the site and climate scenario. As expected, thinning was simulated to have an overall positive effect on the blue water yield and tree water status, which increased and also tended to last longer for higher thinning intensities. However, the magnitude of this effect on tree water status was most dependent on the site and climatic scenario, as drier conditions generally raised stronger and longer lasting reductions in drought stress for a given thinning intensity. Furthermore, our results highlight the existence of a site- and climate-dependent trade-off between the gain in stand productivity and the improvement in tree water status obtained by thinning, particularly for moderate or heavy thinning intensities. Our simulations suggest that thinning is a useful management tool to mitigate climate change but strongly argue against the application of general recipes across sites and appeals for carefully taking into consideration local climatic trajectories for management planning.

The wind is the main mechanism controlling its drift. In August 2010, a significant number of individuals of this species arrived at the Basque coast (southeastern Bay of Biscay), causing a great socioeconomic impact. Here we investigate the most likely region of origin and routes of these individuals using the Sediment, Oil spill and Fish Tracking model (SOFT). This model was run backwards in time using only the wind drag velocity (i.e., the wind velocity multiplied by a wind drag coefficient) to estimate the drift of these Portuguese man-of-war for one year and taking into account that the final destination was the Basque coast. The wind data were obtained with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Six different simulations were carried out with SOFT using the following wind drag coefficients: 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.04 and 0.045. The simulation period covered from the end of August 2010 to the beginning of August 2009. After the first eight months of simulation (i.e., at the beginning of January 2010), the virtual Portuguese man-of-war used in SOFT were located near or on the northwest and southwest coasts of France and England, respectively, and in the English Channel, the southern Celtic Sea and the northwestern Bay of Biscay. However, at the end of the simulation period (i.e., at the beginning of August 2009), most of these Portuguese man-of-war were located between the central part of the Bay of Biscay (similar to 5 degrees W) and the open North Atlantic Ocean (similar to 35 degrees W), depending on the wind drag coefficient. From these results, we conclude that the region of origin of the Portuguese man-of-war arriving at the Basque coast in August 2010 was probably located in the northern part of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. This conclusion is in agreement with the general wind-driven circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The current study was conducted to map the distribution of current and future climatic niche of endangered Himalayan musk deer, a species endemic to Asia. Maxent and GARP modeling algorithms were individually employed to forecast current and future climatic niche of the species using randomly collected occurrence records of the species and bioclimatic variables with 30 '' resolution from WorldClim' datasets. Both the modeling processes performed optimally with regard to AUC and TSS values and forecasted an increase/expansion of climatically-suitable geographical space in the future. A final climatic niche distribution map was produced by combining the binary maps generated from each of the processes to produce a relatively realistic and potentially accurate distribution of climatic niche of the species over space and time.

Using observations and experiments to investigate the consequences of such declines are hampered because trees are long-lived. Simulation models can provide a means to forecast possible futures based on different scenarios of tree species decline, death, and removal. Such modeling is particularly urgent for species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation species in many northeastern forest regions that is declining due to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Here, we used an individual-based forest simulator, SORTIE-ND, to forecast changes in forest communities in Central Massachusetts over the next 200 yr under a range of scenarios: a no-adelgid, status quo scenario; partial resistance of hemlock to the adelgid; adelgid irruption and total hemlock decline over 25 yr, adelgid irruption and salvage logging of hemlock trees; and two scenarios of preemptive logging of hemlock and hemlock/white pine. We applied the model to six study plots comprising a range of initial species mixtures, abundances, and levels of hemlock dominance. Simulations indicated that eastern white pine, and to a lesser extent black birch and American beech, would gain most in relative abundance and basal area following hemlock decline. The relative dominance of these species depended on initial conditions and the amount of hemlock mortality, and their combined effect on neighborhood-scale community dynamics. Simulated outcomes were little different whether hemlock died out gradually due to the adelgid or disappeared rapidly following logging. However, if eastern hemlock were to become partially resistant to the adelgid, hemlock would be able to retain its dominance despite substantial losses of basal area. Our modeling highlights the complexities associated with secondary forest succession due to ongoing hemlock decline and loss. We emphasize the need both for a precautionary approach in deciding between management intervention or simply doing nothing in these declining hemlock forests, and for clear aims and understanding regarding desired community- and ecosystem-level outcomes.",,,,"Buckley, Hannah/U-4758-2017","Buckley, Hannah/0000-0002-4170-080X; Barker Plotkin, Audrey/0000-0002-4473-9785; Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081; Case, Bradley/0000-0002-4360-335X","Harvard University; Lincoln University; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0620443, 1237491]","We acknowledge support provided to BSC and HLB as part of the Charles Bullard Fellowship research program at Harvard University and by Lincoln University.

Understanding why heterogeneity exists in animal-habitat spatial relationships is critical for identifying the drivers of animal distributions. Functional responses in habitat selection - whereby animals adjust their habitat selection depending on habitat availability - are useful for describing animal-habitat spatial heterogeneity. However, they could be yielded by different movement tactics, involving contrasting interspecific interactions. 2. Identifying functional responses in animal movement, rather than in emergent spatial patterns like habitat selection, could disentangle the effects of different movement behaviours on spatial heterogeneity in animal-habitat relationships. This would clarify how functional responses in habitat selection emerge and provide a general tool for understanding the mechanistic drivers of animal distributions. 3. We tested this approach using data from GPS-collared woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a prey species under top-down control. We tested how caribou selected and moved with respect to a key resource (lichen-conifer stands) as a function of the availability of surrounding refuge land-cover (closed-conifer stands), using step selection functions. 4. Caribou selected resource patches more strongly in areas richer in refuge land-cover - a functional response in habitat selection. However, adjustments in multiple movement behaviours could have generated this pattern: stronger directed movement towards resource patches and/or longer residency within resource patches, in areas richer in refuges. Different contributions of these behaviours would produce contrasting forager spatial dynamics. 5. We identified functional responses in both movement behaviours: caribou were more likely to move towards resource patches in areas richer in refuge land-cover, and to remain in these patches during movement steps. This tactic enables caribou to forage for longer in safer areas where they can rapidly seek refuge in dense cover when predators are detected. 6. Our study shows that functional responses in movement can expose the context-dependent movement decisions that generate heterogeneity in animal-habitat spatial relationships. We used these functional responses to characterise anti-predator movement tactics employed by a large herbivore, but they could be applied in many different scenarios. The movement rules from functional responses in movement are well-suited to integration in spatial explicit individual-based models for forecasting animal distributions in landscapes undergoing environmental change.",,,,,"Mason, Tom/0000-0003-0834-0571","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Sylviculture and Wildlife Research Chair and Discovery Grants); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies; Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs","Funding was provided by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Sylviculture and Wildlife Research Chair and Discovery Grants), Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies, and the Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs.

We assessed soil CPs applied by producers, in partnership with the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), based on their effectiveness at improving stream fish assemblages in the Missouri River basin. Multiple-regression models were used to predict the combined watershed scale effects of physiography, anthropogenic threats, and soil CPs on abundance of lithophilous spawning fishes, a reproductive guild sensitive to sedimentation. Two scenarios of lithophilous spawning guild abundance were predicted for each stream segment where (1) base condition of guild abundance assumed,no CPs were applied and (2) a conservation condition abundance, which accounted for the effects of applied CPs. Abundance of The lithophilous spawning guild was positively associated with applied soil CP density. Models revealed that streams generally needed more than 50% of the agricultural land within their watershed to be treated by soil CPs to see significant improvement in the lithophilous spawning guild.

Predicting how managed ecosystems may respond to climatic extremes is intensified by uncertainty associated with knowing when, where, and how long effects of extreme events will be manifest in an ecosystem. In water-limited ecosystems with high inter-annual variability in rainfall, it is important to be able to distinguish responses that result from seasonal fluctuations in rainfall from long-term directional increases or decreases in precipitation. A tool that successfully distinguishes seasonal from directional biomass responses would allow land managers to make informed decisions about prioritizing mitigation strategies, allocating human resource monitoring efforts, and mobilizing resources to withstand extreme climatic events. We leveraged long-term observations (2000-2013) of quadrat-level plant biomass at multiple locations across a semiarid landscape in southern New Mexico to verify the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as a proxy for changes in aboveground productivity. This period encompassed years of sustained drought (2000-2003) and record-breaking high rainfall (2006 and 2008) followed by subsequent drought years (2011 through 2013) that resulted in a restructuring of plant community composition in some locations. Our objective was to decompose vegetation patterns derived from MODIS NDVI over this period into contributions from (1) the long-term trend, (2) seasonal cycle, and (3) unexplained variance using the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model. BFAST breakpoints in NDVI trend and seasonal components were verified with field-estimated biomass at 15 sites that differed in species richness, vegetation cover, and soil properties. We found that 34 of 45 breaks in NDVI trend reflected large changes in mean biomass and 16 of 19 seasonal breaks accompanied changes in the contribution to biomass by perennial and/or annual grasses. The BFAST method using satellite imagery proved useful for detecting previously reported ground-based changes in vegetation in this arid ecosystem. We demonstrate that time series analysis of NDVI data holds potential for monitoring landscape condition in arid ecosystems at the large spatial scales needed to differentiate responses to a changing climate from responses to seasonal variability in rainfall.",,,,,"Browning, Dawn M./0000-0002-1252-6013","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1235828]; USDA-ARS CRIS ProjectUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [3050-11210-007-00D]; USDI Bureau of Land Management's Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring Program","Funding for long-term field data collection was provided by the National Science Foundation to the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research Program through New Mexico State University (DEB-1235828) and USDA-ARS CRIS Project # 3050-11210-007-00D.

Toll-like receptor genes (TLRs) play a fundamental role in vertebrate immune defence and are predicted to be under balancing selection. We previously characterized variation at TLR loci in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), an endemic passerine that has undergone a historical bottleneck. Five of seven TLR loci were polymorphic, which is in sharp contrast to the low genomewide variation observed. However, standard population genetic statistical methods failed to detect a contemporary signature of selection at any TLR locus. We examined whether the observed TLR polymorphism could be explained by neutral evolution, simulating the population's demography in the software DIYABC. This showed that the posterior distributions of mutation rates had to be unrealistically high to explain the observed genetic variation. We then conducted simulations with an agent-based model using typical values for the mutation rate, which indicated that weak balancing selection has acted on the three TLR genes. The model was able to detect evidence of past selection elevating TLR polymorphism in the prebottleneck populations, but was unable to discern any effects of balancing selection in the contemporary population. Our results show drift is the overriding evolutionary force that has shaped TLR variation in the contemporary Seychelles warbler population, and the observed TLR polymorphisms might be merely the ghost of selection past'. Forecast models predict immunogenetic variation in this species will continue to be eroded in the absence of contemporary balancing selection. Such drift debt' occurs when a gene pool has not yet reached its new equilibrium level of polymorphism, and this loss could be an important threat to many recently bottlenecked populations.",,,,"Richardson, David S/A-5082-2010","Richardson, David S/0000-0001-7226-9074; van Oosterhout, Cock/0000-0002-5653-738X; Hinchcliffe, Danielle/0000-0001-5204-5161","VH-C Dean's PhD Studentship at the University of East Anglia; Natural Environmental Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/I/S/2002/00712, NE/K005502/1]; Earth and Life Systems Alliance (ELSA)",We thank Nature Seychelles for generously allowing us to carry out this long-term Seychelles warbler study and work on Cousin Island.

Here, we argue that replicating and networking transects, along with the introduction of experimental treatments, addresses these concerns. Transect networks provide cost-effective and robust insights into ecological and evolutionary adaptation and improve forecasting of ecosystem change. We draw on the experience and research facilitated by the Australian Transect Network to demonstrate our case, with examples, to clarify how population- and community-level studies can be integrated with observations from multiple transects, manipulative experiments, genomics, and ecological modeling to gain novel insights into how species and systems respond to climate change.

We simulated total tree biomass and responses of individual tree species in each of the 74 ecological subsections across the central hardwood region of the United States under current climate and projected climate at the end of the century from two general circulation models and two representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways. Forest composition and abundance varied by ecological subsection with more dramatic changes occurring with greater changes in temperature and precipitation and on soils with lower water holding capacity. Biomass production across the region followed patterns of soil quality.

Thus, a large amount of information is necessary to analyse change and develop plans for proper management of natural resources. In this work we tested MaxEnt algorithm in a completely remote land-cover classification and change analysis. In order to provide an empirical example, we selected south-eastern Italian Alps, manly Trentino-South Tyrol, as test region. We classified two Landsat images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence for tmsampled locations and to determine the best subset of predictors (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class, representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of occurrence values, was built. In order to better address the patterns of change analysis, we put together difference maps and topographic variables. The latter are considered, at least in the study area, as the main environmental drivers of land-use change, in connection with climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm, applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and surface reflectance. The performed models had satisfactory predictive performance, showing relatively clear patterns of difference between the two considered time steps.

If global warming amplifies water deficit in drought-prone areas, tree populations located at the driest and southernmost distribution limits (rear-edges) should be particularly threatened. Here, we address these statements by analyzing and projecting growth responses to climate of three major tree species (silver fir, Abies alba; Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris; and mountain pine, Pinus uncinata) in mountainous areas of NE Spain. This region is subjected to Mediterranean continental conditions, it encompasses wide climatic, topographic and environmental gradients, and, more importantly, it includes rear-edges of the continuous distributions of these tree species. We used tree-ring width data from a network of 110 forests in combination with the process-based Vaganov-Shashkin-Lite growth model and climate-growth analyses to forecast changes in tree growth during the 21st century. Climatic projections were based on four ensembles CO2 emission scenarios. Warm and dry conditions during the growing season constrain silver fir and Scots pine growth, particularly at the species rear-edge. By contrast, growth of high-elevation mountain pine forests is enhanced by climate warming. The emission scenario (RCP 8.5) corresponding to the most pronounced warming (+1.4 to 4.8 degrees C) forecasted mean growth reductions of -10.7% and -16.4% in silver fir and Scots pine, respectively, after 2050. This indicates that rising temperatures could amplify drought stress and thus constrain the growth of silver fir and Scots pine rear-edge populations growing at xeric sites. Contrastingly, mountain pine growth is expected to increase by +12.5% due to a longer and warmer growing season. The projections of growth reduction in silver fir and Scots pine portend dieback and a contraction of their species distribution areas through potential local extinctions of the most vulnerable driest rearedge stands. Our modeling approach provides accessible tools to evaluate forest vulnerability to warmer conditions.",,,,"Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015; Andreu-Hayles, Laia/H-6200-2012; Gonzalez-Rouco, Jesus Fidel/B-1761-2012; Gutierrez, Emilia/O-7568-2014","Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543; Andreu-Hayles, Laia/0000-0003-4185-681X; Gonzalez-Rouco, Jesus Fidel/0000-0001-7090-6797; Gutierrez, Emilia/0000-0002-6085-5700; Sanguesa-Barreda, Gabriel/0000-0002-7722-2424","OAPN, Spanish Ministry of Environment [387/2011]; Spanish Ministry of Economy [CGL2011-26654, CGL2015-69186-C2-1-R]; MINECO-FPDI (FEDER funds) [201316600]; project CoMo-ReAdapt [CGL2013-48843-C2-1-R]; FEDER-Junta de Andalucia","We acknowledge the use of the E-OBS climate dataset (EU-project ENSEMBLES) and the data providers in the ECA&D project (http://www.ecad.eu) and thank Dr. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh for his assistance.

Tall-shrub expansion into low-statured communities, a hallmark of recent vegetative change across tundra ecosystems, involves three major genera: Alnus, Betula and Salix. Which genus expands most into tundra landscapes will determine ecosystem properties. 2. We show that Alnus and Salix shrubs segregate thermal space (elevation 9 insolation) and colonize tundra landscapes differently in response to climate warming, thereby replacing different tundra types. 3. Vegetative change estimated from repeat photography should account for hill-slope. Methodologically, slope determines surface area estimated from orthophotos as projected pixel area times secant of pixel slope. Ecologically, the change in thermally responsive vegetative area is sensitive to terrain steepness, scaling as the cosecant of hill-slope, so that studies should expect more shrub expansion in areas of shallow slopes than steep slopes. 4. Repeat aerial photography in Alaska's Chugach Mountains from 1972 to 2012 orthorectified on a high-resolution lidar digital elevation model indicated tall Salix was rare in 1972 and colonized warmer slopes by 2012. Tall Alnus colonized steeper, cooler slopes both by 2012 and by 1972. Salix and forest colonized similar thermal space. Colonization probability for both shrub genera was maximized at intermediate elevations. 5. Alnus colonization adjacent to dwarf-shrub tundra was twenty times as likely as Salix colonization. Salix colonization adjacent to low-shrub/herbaceous tundra was three times as likely as Alnus colonization. Replacement of dwarf-shrub tundra by Alnus and of low-shrub/herbaceous communities by Salix will affect herbivores and soil properties. 6. Good agreement between observations of plant functional type and multinomial predictions in a thermal space defined by elevation and insolation suggested that these two variables were sufficient for forecast modelling. Spatially explicit, climate-driven generalized linear multinomial and random forest classification models in available thermal space forecast surface areas of forest, Alnus, Salix and tundra over a range of warming, modelled as upward shifted isotherms, including expected IPCC scenarios. Both modelling approaches indicated that shrubs may respond nonlinearly to warming. 7. Synthesis.

Since January 2016, publically available regional avalanche warnings are issued daily for Nordenskiold Land, the area around Longyearbyen. Avalanche warning services rely on information of when and where avalanches occur. Systematic field observations of avalanche activity are not feasible across all of the vast area (ca. 7200 km(2)) of Nordenskiold Land. Svalbard also experiences over four months of polar night per year. However, using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a weather-and light-independent technique, large areas can be monitored at once. We have developed a SAR-based automatic avalanche debris detection algorithm and tested it on satellite image pairs from Sentinel-1A at medium resolution and from Radarsat-2 at very high resolution. The detection algorithm uses a threshold value that distinguishes avalanche debris with increased backscatter from undisturbed snow with lower backscatter. Depending on the spatial resolution of the SAR image, different post-processing filters are applied. There is a promising level of agreement between automatic detection results and manual identification of avalanche debris, but the algorithm's drawback is marked overdetection.

While each stressor in isolation has been studied extensively, there has been less focus on their combined effects, which could impact key ecological processes. We tested the independent and combined effects of short-term exposure to elevated CO2 and temperature on the predator-prey interactions of a common pair of coral reef fishes (Pomacentrus wardi and its predator, Pseudochromis fuscus). We found that predator success increased following independent exposure to high temperature and elevated CO2. Overall, high temperature had an overwhelming effect on the escape behaviour of the prey compared with the combined exposure to elevated CO2 and high temperature or the independent effect of elevated CO2. Exposure to high temperatures led to an increase in attack and predation rates. By contrast, we observed little influence of elevated CO2 on the behaviour of the predator, suggesting that the attack behaviour of P. fuscus was robust to this environmental change. This is the first study to address how the kinematics and swimming performance at the basis of predator-prey interactions may change in response to concurrent exposure to elevated CO2 and high temperatures and represents an important step to forecasting the responses of interacting species to climate change.",,,,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014; Munday, Philip/F-5443-2011; Watson, Sue-Ann/C-3172-2013","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645; Munday, Philip/0000-0001-9725-2498; Watson, Sue-Ann/0000-0002-9818-7429",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [DP120101993],Funding was provided by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and an ARC Discovery grant (M.I.M.; DP120101993).,,,11,12,3,81,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

To improve the understanding of how these gradients impact forest dynamics, we tested two hypotheses: (1) the change of the tree growth-climate relationship is similar along both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and (2) the time periods during which climate affects growth the most occur later towards higher latitudes and altitudes. To address this, we utilized tree-ring data from a latitudinal gradient in Finland and from two altitudinal gradients on the Tibetan Plateau. We analysed the latitudinal and altitudinal growth patterns in tree rings and investigated the growth-climate relationship of trees by correlating ring-width index chronologies with climate variables, calculating with flexible time windows, and using daily-resolution climate data. High latitude and altitude plots showed higher correlations between tree-ring chronologies and growing season temperature. However, the effects of winter temperature showed contrasting patterns for the gradients. The timing of the highest correlation with temperatures during the growing season at southern sites was approximately 1 month ahead of that at northern sites in the latitudinal gradient. In one out of two altitudinal gradients, the timing for the strongest negative correlation with temperature at low-altitude sites was ahead of treeline sites during the growing season, possibly due to differences in moisture limitation. Mean values and the standard deviation of tree-ring width increased with increasing mean July temperatures on both types of gradients. Our results showed similarities of tree growth responses to increasing seasonal temperature between latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. However, differences in climate-growth relationships were also found between gradients due to differences in other factors such as moisture conditions.

We investigated how environmental variation influences the evolutionary potential of phenotypic traits. We used published data to collect or calculate 135 estimates of evolvability of morphological traits of European wild bird populations. We characterized the environmental favourability of each population throughout the species' breeding distribution. Our results suggest that the evolutionary potential of morphological traits decreases as environmental favourability becomes high or low. Strong environmental selection pressures and high intra-specific competition may reduce species' evolutionary potential in low-and highfavourability areas, respectively. This suggests that species may be least able to adapt to new climate conditions at their range margins and at the centre. Our results underscore the need to consider the evolutionary potential of populations when studying the drivers of species distributions, particularly when predicting the effects of environmental change.

However, uncertainty about the SDM projections has been criticized as a major challenge to reliable projections. The present research investigated uncertainty among competing models (Model uncertainty) and uncertainty of future climate conditions (climate uncertainty) driving from different GCMs and CO2 emission scenarios in predicting the future distributions of plants. For this purpose, using nine single-model algorithms and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method, we modeled the geographical distributions of Silver Magnolia (Machilus thunbergii Siebold & Zucc.), a warm-adapted evergreen broadleaved tree; furthermore, we predicted its future distributions under 20 climate change scenarios (5 global circulation models (GCMs) x 4 CO2 emission scenarios (RCPs)). The results showed a great variation in the accuracies of nine single-model projections: the mean AUC values of nine single-models ranged from 0.764 (SER) to 0.970 (RF), and the mean TSS ranged from 0.529 (SRE) to 0.852 (RF). RF (mean AUC= 0.970, mean TSS = 0.852) and the ensemble forecast (AUC= 0.968, TSS=0.804) showed the highest predictive power, while SRE showed the lowest. The future distributions of Silver Magnolia projected with the ensemble SDM clearly varied according to GCMs and RCPs. The twenty climate scenarios produced twenty different projections of the magnolia prospective distribution. GCMs commonly projected the maximum range expansion under RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2070, but CO2 emission scenarios explaining the minimum expansions differed according to GCMs. In conclusion, our results show that GCMs, CO2 emission scenarios and SDM algorithms produce considerable variations in the SDM projections. Therefore, this research suggests that understanding of model and climate uncertainties is critical for an effective conservation planning in forest management under climate change on the Korean Peninsula.

Patch connectivity is thus critical to predicting the fates of expanding populations. Connectivity in river networks results from river dendritic structure and dispersal modality of organisms. Both factors may strongly affect the colonization process and the efficiency of conservation action plans. Based on empirical data, we simulated, using a simplified model with limited number of parameters, the colonization of a large river network, the Loire River, by the native Eurasian beaver and the invasive African clawed frog. For each species, we inferred model parameters (dispersal behavior and distances) by comparing the simulated and the observed distributions. Using network theory, we evaluated the efficiency of alternative conservation strategies to prevent or promote colonization of the river network. Network robustness to fragmentation and disturbance was also assessed. The model acdurately predicted > 70% of the observed species ranges. Conservation strategies that selectively protect habitat patches with the highest connectivity values provide a weak advantage at preventing connectivity loss compared to random protection strategies. In contrast, the targeted destruction of highly connected patches had a much stronger effect on the fragmentation of the network than the random removal of habitat patches. Spatial network topology strongly contributes to determining colonization patterns of large river watersheds.

However, landscape-scale studies of the patterns and drivers of species richness in this region are scarce, raising the possibility that dramatic changes to biodiversity could occur undetected over a wide area with serious consequences for ecosystem integrity and conservation. We used a hierarchical, systematic design to compile a uniquely large and comprehensive diversity dataset for our study area in subarctic North America. We utilized a unified sampling frame at the landscape scale to record diversity of vascular plants, mosses, and macrolichens as the three primary components of vegetation species richness. We applied Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques to identify site attributes associated with richness of the three functional groups. We also examined whether richness of groups was positively or negatively intercorrelated across multiple spatial scales. Our goal was to quantify the fundamental relationships of species richness with site attributes across this landscape to better understand the possible responses of species richness to habitat changes forecast to occur in the subarctic as a result of a warming climate and other stressors. Moss, vascular plant, and terricolous macrolichen species richness were strongly inter-correlated, due to an underlying marked positive association of each with increasing elevation into the alpine zone across multiple spatial scales. Our results further reveal varying influences of factors such as soil pH, disturbance, and plant canopy cover on diversity in these physiologically different functional groups. Taken together, the patterns revealed by our work provide a new framework to consider how predicted habitat changes wrought by warming climates in interior Alaska may affect fundamental diversity patterns of primary producers in the future, with important implications for ecosystem function and conservation.",,,,,,U.S. National Park Service; Central Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network,"We thank M.

The impacts of climate extremes on forest productivity and health remain difficult to predict due to potential interactions with disturbance events and forest dynamics-changes in forest stand composition, density, size and age structure over time. Such interactions may lead to non-linear forest growth responses to climate involving thresholds and lag effects. Understanding how forest dynamics influence growth responses to climate is particularly important given stand structure and composition can be modified through management to increase forest resistance and resilience to climate change. To inform such adaptive management, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian state space model in which climate effects on tree growth are allowed to vary over time and in relation to past climate extremes, disturbance events, and forest dynamics. The model is an important step toward integrating disturbance and forest dynamics into predictions of forest growth responses to climate extremes. We apply the model to a dendrochronology data set from forest stands of varying composition, structure, and development stage in northeastern Minnesota that have experienced extreme climate years and forest tent caterpillar defoliation events. Mean forest growth was most sensitive to water balance variables representing climatic water deficit. Forest growth responses to water deficit were partitioned into responses driven by climatic threshold exceedances and interactions with insect defoliation. Forest growth was both resistant and resilient to climate extremes with the majority of forest growth responses occurring after multiple climatic threshold exceedances across seasons and years. Interactions between climate and disturbance were observed in a subset of years with insect defoliation increasing forest growth sensitivity to water availability. Forest growth was particularly sensitive to climate extremes during periods of high stem density following major regeneration events when average inter-tree competition was high. Results suggest the resistance and resilience of forest growth to climate extremes can be increased through management steps such as thinning to reduce competition during early stages of stand development and small-group selection harvests to maintain forest structures characteristic of older, mature stands.",,,,"Bradford, John/E-5545-2011","Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303; Foster, Jane/0000-0002-5997-0269","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1513481, EF-1137309, EF-1241874, EF-1253225]; Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center; NASA Carbon Monitoring System; USGS Ecosystems Mission Area; Climate and Land Use Change Mission Area","The authors thank the Subject Matter Editor and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and feedback during the drafting of this paper.

Within complex ecological systems, identifying animal species likely to play a key role in the emergence of infectious zoonotic diseases remains a major challenge. One approach consists of using information on current ecological and parasitological similarities among host species in order to predict the most likely pathways for future pathogen spillover. 2. Using field data acquired from 15 sympatric rodent species in various habitats in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, we built networks based on shared parasites (17 helminth and 15 microparasite species) and shared habitats among rodent species and humans. We investigated the architectures of bipartite and unipartite networks using modularity, subgroups partitioning or node centrality, to assess the relative epidemiological importance of particular rodent species. 3. Our results showed that Rattus tanezumi, Bandicota savilei and R. exulans were consistently found to be members of subgroups that included humans in unipartite and bipartite networks on zoonotic agents and shared habitats. High values of centrality in shared zoonotic agents were found for the same three rodent species, whereas high values of shared habitats were observed for two of them. Although phylogenetically related rodent species likely shared both habitats and parasites, a lack of habitat specialization was associated with increased zoonotic parasite sharing. 4. Our results emphasize the disproportionate importance of these three rodent species, through their high degree of connectivity with humans, which may represent a high risk for direct zoonotic spillover. Moreover, due to its high centrality in habitats, R. tanezumi may also play a key role as a bridge host. 5. The recent discovery of new arenaviruses in rodents in South-East Asia, with associated disease in humans in Cambodia, provides an opportunity to test this empirically. The three rodent species identified using our network approach are some of the potential maintenance hosts for these new emerging arenaviruses. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results on rodents and their pathogens in South-East Asia show that network analysis has a high potential to improve the surveillance of emerging zoonotic pathogens by targeting key host species and potential 'emerging' pathogen-rodent interactions in complex and heterogeneous landscapes.",,,,"Caron, Alexandre/F-8969-2010; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/AAI-1550-2019; Morand, Serge/M-5433-2018; Blasdell, Kim/G-9346-2013","Caron, Alexandre/0000-0002-5213-3273; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/0000-0002-5438-1473; Morand, Serge/0000-0003-3986-7659; Blasdell, Kim/0000-0003-2121-0376",French ANR BiodiversityFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR 07 BDIV 012]; French ANR CPESFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR 11 CPEL 002]; FSP-RenCaRe project - Ministere Francais des Affaires Etrangeres et Europeennes; ANR CP&ES grant (SAVARID project)French National Research Agency (ANR),"The authors declare no conflict of interests.

Individual-based models (IBMs) offer a way to assess population-level, aggregate effects of disturbance on wildlife. We created Tolerance in Raptors and the Associated Impacts of Leisure Sports (TRAILS), an IBM that simulates interactions between recreationists and nesting raptors, to assess the effect of human disturbance on raptor populations and test if changes in tolerance to disturbance could mitigate negative consequences. We used behavioral and demographic data from golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos, and recreation activity data to parameterize TRAILS and simulate the effects of pedestrian and off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation on the likelihood of territory occupancy, egg-laying and nest survival of eagles over 100years. We modeled eagle populations in the absence of recreation, with stationary 2014 levels of recreation, and with annual increases in recreation. Furthermore, we simulated eagles that developed tolerance to disturbance randomly, through natural selection, habitat imprinting, or habituation. In the presence of recreation, simulated eagle populations had significantly lower and more variable growth rates, population sizes and territory occupancy. Annual increases in recreation of 1-2% greatly exacerbated population declines. Though both habituation and natural selection lead to more tolerant eagle populations, neither buffered eagle populations from detrimental effects of recreation. These results suggest that long-lived species that experience encroachment from human activities may not adapt to human disturbance at a rate that compensates for changes in disturbance. This project illustrates the usefulness of IBMs for evaluating non-lethal threats, forecasting population changes and testing theoretical feedbacks in system processes.",,,,"Heath, Julie/D-5600-2011","Heath, Julie/0000-0002-9606-1689; Spaul, Robert/0000-0003-1524-908X","NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIA-1301792, 1229709]; Raptor Research Center and Department of Biological Sciences at Boise State University; Bureau of Land Management; USFWS Western Golden Eagle Team","This research was supported by the NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program and by the National Science Foundation under award number IIA-1301792, the Raptor Research Center and Department of Biological Sciences at Boise State University, the Bureau of Land Management and the USFWS Western Golden Eagle Team.

Once restricted to the Americas, the bacterium, which causes olive quick decline syndrome, was discovered near Lecce, Italy in 2013. Since the initial outbreak, it has invaded 23,000 ha of olives in the Apulian Region, southern Italy, and is of great concern throughout Mediterranean basin. Therefore, predicting its spread and estimating the efficacy of control are of utmost importance. As data on this invasive infectious disease are poor, we have developed a spatially-explicit simulation model for X. fastidiosa to provide guidance for predicting spread in the early stages of invasion and inform management strategies. The model qualitatively and quantitatively predicts the patterns of spread. We model control zones currently employed in Apulia, showing that increasing buffer widths decrease infection risk beyond the control zone, but this may not halt the spread completely due to stochastic long-distance jumps caused by vector dispersal. Therefore, management practices should aim to reduce vector long-distance dispersal. We find optimal control scenarios that minimise control effort while reducing X. fastidiosa spread maximally-suggesting that increasing buffer zone widths should be favoured over surveillance efforts as control budgets increase. Our model highlights the importance of non-olive hosts which increase the spread rate of the disease and may lead to an order of magnitude increase in risk. Many aspects of X. fastidiosa disease invasion remain uncertain and hinder forecasting; we recommend future studies investigating quantification of the infection growth rate, and short and long distance dispersal.",,,,"Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Chapman, Daniel/O-5100-2019; Chapman, Daniel S/C-2900-2008","Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Chapman, Daniel S/0000-0003-1836-4112; Hooftman, Danny/0000-0001-9835-6897",European Food Safety Authority Project [OC/EFSA/PLH/2012/01]; Natural Environment Research Council National Capability HARM [HARM NEC05100]; Horizon XF-ACTORS Project [SFS-09-2016],"We would like to thank Giuseppe Stancanelli, Donato Boscia and Maria Saponari for useful discussions on the spread of Xylella fastidiosa in Italy.

However, the mechanistic basis for niche shifts during invasion is poorly understood and has rarely been captured within species distribution models. We quantified the consequence of between-population variation in phenology for invasion of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) across Europe. Ragweed is of serious concern because of its harmful effects as a crop weed and because of its impact on public health as a major aeroallergen. We developed a forward mechanistic species distribution model based on responses of ragweed development rates to temperature and photoperiod. The model was parameterized and validated from the literature and by reanalyzing data from a reciprocal common garden experiment in which native and invasive populations were grown within and beyond the current invaded range. It could therefore accommodate between-population variation in the physiological requirements for flowering, and predict the potentially invaded ranges of individual populations. Northern-origin populations that were established outside the generally accepted climate envelope of the species had lower thermal requirements for bud development, suggesting local adaptation of phenology had occurred during the invasion. The model predicts that this will extend the potentially invaded range northward and increase the average suitability across Europe by 90% in the current climate and 20% in the future climate. Therefore, trait variation observed at the population scale can trigger a climatic niche shift at the biogeographic scale. For ragweed, earlier flowering phenology in established northern populations could allow the species to spread beyond its current invasive range, substantially increasing its risk to agriculture and public health. Mechanistic species distribution models offer the possibility to represent niche shifts by varying the traits and niche responses of individual populations. Ignoring such effects could substantially underestimate the extent and impact of invasions.",,,,"Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Chapman, Daniel/O-5100-2019; Chapman, Daniel S/C-2900-2008","Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Chapman, Daniel S/0000-0003-1836-4112",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ENV.B2/ETU/2010/0037]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NEC05100]; Svenska Forskningsradet FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [217-2012-994]; EUEuropean Union (EU) [EVK2-CT2001-00132],"D.

There are numerous methods and metrics for quantifying species range shifts, but we currently lack a comprehensive review of existing approaches used in species range shift studies. Location: Global. Time period: 2013 - 2014. Major taxa studied: All taxa. Methods: We conducted a quantitative literature review to first identify the methods currently used for defining a species' range over a particular time and then to identify metrics used for measuring changes in species ranges over time. We provide a roadmap for the selection of methods and metrics for measuring species ranges and species range shifts by discussing opportunities, assumptions and constraints of the different approaches. Results: Our literature review revealed six main methods for defining species ranges: observational studies, grid-based mapping, convex hull, kriging, species distribution modelling and hybrid methods. These methods are used with three main metric classes to measure species range shifts: changes in range limit, size and the probability of species occurrences or suitability. Most methods for defining species ranges and subsequent range shifts can be applied to different spatial extents and resolutions and taxa. However, only species distribution models (SDMs) and hybrid methods allow for the exploration of the relationship between species occurrence and environmental variables, and only these methods can be used for forecasting species ranges into future environments. Likewise, the inclusion of ecological processes in range shift calculations requires researchers to use hybrid methods or mechanistic models. Main conclusions: Our review revealed a high diversity of methods and metrics used to quantify species range shifts. As these methods and metrics underlie many of the conservation strategies proposed for climate change mitigation (e.g., protection of refugia), we urge the conservation community to evaluate underlying approaches for defining species ranges and measuring species range shifts with an equal level of scrutiny as the conservation strategies that these methods and metrics enable.",,,,,"Yalcin, Semra/0000-0002-6622-4125",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Research and Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador; Advanced Computing Research in Atlantic Canada (ACENET),"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Research and Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador, Advanced Computing Research in Atlantic Canada (ACENET)",,,16,17,0,37,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Using beetle structural diversity and plant composition as recorded prior to marine and human influences as a 'past analogue', we reconstructed the impact of the Holocene relative sea-level rise on the coastal ecosystem. Our results show that beetle species richness and diversity were highest when freshwater was predominant, which was the case until about 6200 years ago. We also found that a major increase in salinity had occurred over the last 5300 years, experiencing a peak rate of increase at about 3700 years ago. These changes are clearly reflected in the fossil records of the following key taxa: halophilous beetles (Ochthebius sp., Pterostichus cursor), halophilous plants (Chenopodiaceae, Tamarix) and non-pollen palynomorphs (microforaminiferal linings). In particular, we note that the majority (60%) of wetland beetle fauna became locally extinct in response to the salinity changes, and these changes were exacerbated by the recent aggravation of human pressures on the island. The major part of this diversity loss occurred 3700 years ago, when the relative Mediterranean sea-level rose above -1.5 +/- 0.3 meters. These findings demonstrate the value of fossil beetle assemblage analysis as a diagnostic for the response of coastal wetland biodiversity to past salinity increases, and serve as a means of forecasting the effects of sea-level rise in the future.

The existence of increasing inequality creates a challenge for ecological economics. In this paper we set out some of the problems inherent in Piketty's approach and how they are addressed from the point of view of ecological economics. We use Jackson and Victor's response as a point of departure to make several points. Piketty's work involves an unreconciled inconsistency between his laws and the institutional context, which becomes problematic when one starts to think about 'inevitability'. He simply assumes away ecological problems to make future forecasts for inequality. As such, his forecasts are undermined, since ecological issues are fundamental to any viable future economy. Furthermore, Piketty effectively reproduces (rather than contests) the mainstream practice of delegating ecological issues to a sub-discipline. Jackson and Victor, meanwhile, focus on the mainstream economic aspect of Piketty's work, and construct a model to contest a model. In so doing, they provide an ideational response to what is also a problem of ideological frameworks. Though it can be important to contest an idea, they inadvertently, through family resemblance, contribute to the reproduction of the problematic position of ecological concerns within dominant ways,of conceiving economics.

Most studies assume perception of resources as the navigational mechanism. The possible role of memory that would allow forecasting conditions at distant locations and times based on information about environmental conditions from previous years has been little studied. We study migrating zebra in Botswana using an individual-based simulation model, where perceptually guided individuals use currently sensed resources at different perceptual ranges, while memory guided individuals use long-term averages of past resources to forecast future conditions. We compare simulated individuals guided by perception or memory on resource landscapes of remotely sensed vegetation data to trajectories of GPS-tagged zebras. Our results show that memory provides a clear signal that best directs migrants to their destination compared to perception at even the largest perceptual ranges. Zebras modelled with memory arrived two to four times, or up to 100 km, closer to the migration destination than those using perception. We suggest that memory in addition to perception is important for directing ungulate migration. Furthermore, our findings are important for the conservation of migratory mammals, as memory informing direction suggests migration routes could be relatively inflexible.",,,,"; Mueller, Thomas/A-1740-2014","Bracis, Chloe/0000-0003-4058-7638; Mueller, Thomas/0000-0001-9305-7716",Goethe International Post-Doc Programme (GO-IN) under European Commission; Robert Bosch Foundation,"C.B. was partially funded by the Goethe International Post-Doc Programme (GO-IN), funded under the 7th Framework of the European Commission.

While a wealth of research is devoted to the impacts of climate change on distribution range and phenology of migratory birds, the indirect effects of climate change on optimal migratory routes and flyways, through changes in air movements, are poorly understood. Here, we predict the influence of climate change on the migratory route of a long-distant migrant using an ensemble of correlative modelling approaches, and present and future atmospheric data obtained from a regional climate model. We show that changes in wind conditions by mid-century will result in a slight shift and reduction in the suitable areas for migration of the study species, the Oriental honey-buzzard, over a critical section of its autumn journey, followed by a complete loss of this section of the traditional route by late century. Our results highlight the need for investigating the consequences of climate change-induced disturbance in wind support for long-distance migratory birds, particularly species that depend on the wind to cross ecological barriers, and those that will be exposed to longer journeys due to future range shifts.",,,,"Nourani, Elham/E-2623-2016","Nourani, Elham/0000-0003-4420-3902","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26440245]; Japanese Ministry of the EnvironmentMinistry of the Environment, Japan",This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI grant no. 26440245 and the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.,,,6,6,1,49,,,,0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Methods based on species- and endemics-area relationships are well developed, but applications to date have concentrated primarily on the fragmentation of formerly continuous habitats such as forests and woodlands. Applying these area-based methods to predict extinction risk in habitat types occurring naturally as spatially discrete patches has been largely ignored. We address this knowledge gap using a network of seasonally connected wetlands. We modelled the risk of extinction associated with native wetland plant communities under two alternative scenarios: the loss of (i) entire wetlands (patch loss) versus (ii) an equivalent area distributed across the wetlands (area loss). Patch-loss scenarios resulted in more than twice the number of species going extinct than the equivalent loss of area. Extinction due to patch loss was highest when wetlands were removed in increasing size order (smallest to largest) a plausible scenario arising from forecast climatic drying in the region. Small wetlands contained >16% of endemic species in only <5% of wetland area, largely explaining this result. Extinction risk associated with naturally occurring habitat patches depends on the distribution of regionally endemic species; where this is not solely a function of habitat area, the loss of small patches can represent higher risk than an equivalent reduction in total habitat area across the network.

Most assessments of climate change are primarily species-focused and do not directly estimate how entire ecosystems may change. Using an ecosystem-based modelling approach, we provide a region-wide climate change vulnerability assessment of the seven major ecosystems across Africa's Albertine Rift. The Albertine Rift is a global biodiversity hotspot, containing more endemic vertebrates than anywhere else in Africa. We used Maxent to estimate each ecosystem's extent using current climate data, then we projected the potential distribution of each ecosystem for 2050 and 2070. We found that suitable conditions for most ecosystems are predicted to contract rapidly in extent and shift upwards in altitude. High-altitude ecosystems and the endemic species they support are at immediate risk, owing to rapid predicted shrinkage in their suitable extent. Only the Combretum-grasslands savannah ecosystem is predicted to expand, with suitable conditions increasing by 32% in area by 2050. The extent and structure of boundary zones between the Rift's ecosystems may change significantly through time, due to the contractions and shifts of the environmental conditions for existing ecosystem distributions. By 2070, 44% of the region could be climatically unsuitable for the current ecosystems. Conservation planning across the Rift will need to account for these ecosystem shifts and rapidly changing boundary zones to ensure the long-term persistence of the many endemic species. Beyond the Albertine Rift, this ecosystem-based modelling technique can be adapted to any terrestrial region, providing critical information for conservation vulnerability assessments.

Traditional population models built with detailed demographic observations from one study site can address the impacts of environmental change at particular locations, but are difficult to scale up to the landscape and regional scales relevant to management decisions. An alternative is to build models using population-level data that are much easier to collect over broad spatial scales than individual-level data. However, it is unknown whether models built using population-level data adequately capture the effects of density-dependence and environmental forcing that are necessary to generate skillful forecasts. Here, we test the consequences of aggregating individual responses when forecasting the population states (percent cover) and trajectories of four perennial grass species in a semi-arid grassland in Montana, USA. We parameterized two population models for each species, one based on individual-level data (survival, growth and recruitment) and one on population-level data (percent cover), and compared their forecasting accuracy and forecast horizons with and without the inclusion of climate covariates. For both models, we used Bayesian ridge regression to weight the influence of climate covariates for optimal prediction. In the absence of climate effects, we found no significant difference between the forecast accuracy of models based on individual-level data and models based on population-level data. Climate effects were weak, but increased forecast accuracy for two species. Increases in accuracy with climate covariates were similar between model types. In our case study, percent cover models generated forecasts as accurate as those from a demographic model. For the goal of forecasting, models based on aggregated individual-level data may offer a practical alternative to data-intensive demographic models. Long time series of percent cover data already exist for many plant species. Modelers should exploit these data to predict the impacts of environmental change.",,,,,"Tredennick, Andrew/0000-0003-1254-3339","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1400370, MSB-1241856, DEB-1054040]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University","This work was funded by the National Science Foundation through a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology to A.T.T.

Although large algal blooms can have significant negative impacts on ecosystems and human health, a predictive understanding of these events has eluded science, and many have come to regard them as ultimately random phenomena. However, the highly nonlinear nature of ecological dynamics can give the appearance of randomness and stress traditional methods-such as model fitting or analysis of variance-to the point of breaking. The intractability of this problem from a classical linear standpoint can thus give the impression that algal blooms are fundamentally unpredictable. Here, we use an exceptional time series study of coastal phytoplankton dynamics at La Jolla, CA, with an equation-free modeling approach, to show that these phenomena are not random, but can be understood as nonlinear population dynamics forced by external stochastic drivers (so-called ""stochastic chaos""). The combination of this modeling approach with an extensive dataset allows us to not only describe historical behavior and clarify existing hypotheses about the mechanisms, but also make out-of-sample predictions of recent algal blooms at La Jolla that were not included in the model development.",,,,,"Seger, Kerri/0000-0002-9557-508X; Ye, Hao/0000-0002-8630-1458","Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring Program, NOAA [NA11NOS0120029]; MacArthur Foundation; Cal-COFI; Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [15 RC-2509]; Lenfest Ocean Program [00028335]; EPA-STAR Fellowship ProgramUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; National Science Foundation GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020372]; Sea Grant Population Dynamics Fellowship [E/PD-9]; Sugihara Family Trust; Deutsche Bank-Jameson Complexity Studies Fund; McQuown Chair in Natural Sciences, University of California, San Diego","Patricia Walker and Connie Fey were responsible for data collection at the SIO Pier.

Although climate change is significantly impacting species' distributions, few studies have examined associated changes in behavior. Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) subpopulations have varied in their near-term responses to sea ice decline. We examined behavioral responses of two adjacent subpopulations to changes in habitat availability during the annual sea ice minimum using activity data. Location and activity sensor data collected from 1989 to 2014 for 202 adult female polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea (SB) and Chukchi Sea (CS) subpopulations were used to compare activity in three habitat types varying in prey availability: (1) land; (2) ice over shallow, biologically productive waters; and (3) ice over deeper, less productive waters. Bears varied activity across and within habitats with the highest activity at 50-75% sea ice concentration over shallow waters. On land, SB bears exhibited variable but relatively high activity associated with the use of subsistence-harvested bowhead whale carcasses, whereas CS bears exhibited low activity consistent with minimal feeding. Both subpopulations had fewer observations in their preferred shallow-water sea ice habitats in recent years, corresponding with declines in availability of this substrate. The substantially higher use of marginal habitats by SB bears is an additional mechanism potentially explaining why this subpopulation has experienced negative effects of sea ice loss compared to the still-productive CS subpopulation. Variability in activity among, and within, habitats suggests that bears alter their behavior in response to habitat conditions, presumably in an attempt to balance prey availability with energy costs.",,,,"Bromaghin, Jeffrey F/B-5058-2009","Bromaghin, Jeffrey F/0000-0002-7209-9500; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104; Jansen, Heiko/0000-0003-0178-396X; Pagano, Anthony/0000-0003-2176-0909",U.S. Geological Survey's Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Detroit Zoological Association; Coastal Impact Assessment Program through State of Alaska [M11AF00060]; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,"This work was supported by U.S. Geological Survey's Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

We sought to determine if recent warming is driving contrasting growth responses of Himalayan birch, at moist treeline (Lete Lekh) and semi-arid timberline (Chimang Lekh) sites in the Trans-Himalayan zone of central Nepal. We used dendrochronological techniques to measure tree ring width (TRW) and basal area increment (BAI) of birch trees from climatically contrasting but nearby sites. The TRW series were correlated with climate records from nearby meteorological stations, and BAI was compared between populations to explore growth trends over recent decades. We found contrasting precipitation trends between nearby sites such that the wet site (Lete) is getting warmer and wetter, and the dry site (Chimang) is getting warmer and drier in recent decades. The radial growth of birch in both moist and semi-arid sites are positively correlated to spring (March-May) rainfall, and negatively correlated to mean and maximum temperature for the same period. The growth climate analysis indicated that moisture availability in early growing season is crucial for birch growth at these locations. The BAI of birch is declining more rapidly at the dry timberline than at the moist treelines in the recent decades, indicating that climatic warming might negatively impact birch radial growth where warming interacts with increasing spring drought in the region. Our work highlights contrasting growth response of birch to climate change at moist and semi-arid forests indicating that local climatic variation must be accounted for when assessing and forecasting regional patterns of tree growth in topographically complex regions like Trans-Himalaya, in order to make accurate predictions of vegetation responses to climate change.",,,,"Zhou, Zhekun/G-5281-2011; Fan, Zexin/E-2344-2016","Zhou, Zhekun/0000-0002-0710-2128; Fan, Zexin/0000-0003-4623-6783",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1502231],"This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (U1502231).

The costs and benefits of these interactions show a strong context-dependency directly related to individual variation in partner identity and differential strength. Yet understanding the context-dependency and functional consequences of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions on individuals remains a lasting challenge. We use a network approach to characterize the individual, plant-based pollination interaction networks of the Canarian Isoplexis canariensis (Plantaginaceae) with a mixed assemblage of vertebrate mutualists (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and predispersal seed predators). We identify and quantify interaction typologies based on the sign (mutualistic vs. antagonistic) and strength (weak vs. strong) of animal-mediated pollination and test the relationship with individual female reproductive success (FRS). In addition, we document pollinator movement patterns among individual plants to infer events of pollen transfer/receipt that define the plant mating networks and test the relationship with FRS. We identify six interaction typologies along a mutualism-antagonism gradient, with two typologies being over-represented involving both mutualists and antagonists and influencing FRS. Plants showing strong mutualistic interactions, but also (weak or strong) interactions with antagonists are relatively better connected in the mating network (i.e., with higher potential to transfer or receive pollen). Thus, mixed flower visitor assmblages with mutualists and antagonists give plants increased their importance in the mating networeks, promote outcrossing and increasing both female and male fitness. Our approach helps characterize plant-animal interaction typologies, the context-specificity of diversified mutualisms, and a better forecasting of their functional consequences.",,,,"valido, alfredo/K-1830-2013; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Maria Candelaria C/G-7413-2014; Jordano, Pedro/A-5162-2008","valido, alfredo/0000-0001-8426-8634; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Maria Candelaria C/0000-0003-1879-3590; ",Predoctoral Fellowship [I3P I3PPRE_06_00019 CSIC]; Postdoctoral Grant [RYC-2007-00620]; Junta de Andalucia Excellence GrantJunta de Andalucia [RNM-5731]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [SEV-2012-0262],"We are grateful for comments provided by Francisco Rodriguez-Sanchez and John N.

At the same time, ecological models can be a useful tool for studying the growth and productivity of these stands. This work introduces an assessment of the capacity of the 'FORECAST Climate' hybrid model to simulate water stress and productivity in mixed Scots pine and beech forests in Navarre (northern Spain), and their interaction with different levels of regeneration density. The study included three climate scenarios to test the model capacity to simulate water flows under climate change conditions. Model estimations of water deficit and biomass accumulation were sensitive to the reduction in the initial regeneration density rates. The results indicated that the model shows sufficient capacity to simulate the effects of competition between species on tree mortality in mixedwoods, and to estimate the variables related to water flows. On the one hand, the most significant effects of stand density on water availability occur during the first stage of development, while on the other hand, water stress is greater in the case of beech, although the reduction in competition could offset this increase. The implications of this work for adaptive management of mixed forests suggest applying density control soon in order to have significant cumulative effects in coming decades.",,,,"de Andres, Ester Gonzalez/AAH-3710-2019; Lo, Yueh Hsin/D-2582-2010; Candel-Perez, David/B-9035-2019; Blanco, Juan A./A-4554-2009","Lo, Yueh Hsin/0000-0001-6444-0273; Blanco, Juan A./0000-0002-6524-4335; Candel-Perez, David/0000-0001-5834-965X",,,,,3,3,0,5,,,,1697-2473,,,ECOSISTEMAS,Ecosistemas,MAY-AUG,2017,26,2,,,,,38,51,,10.7818/ECOS.2017.26-2.05,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000441132000005,,,,,

In seasonal ice environments, there is evidence that polar bear predation of Arctic bird eggs is increasing because of earlier sea ice breakup, which forces polar bears into nearshore terrestrial environments where Arctic birds are nesting. Because polar bears can consume a large number of nests before becoming satiated, and because they can swim between island colonies, they could have dramatic influences on seabird and sea duck reproductive success. However, it is unclear whether nest foraging can provide an energetic benefit to polar bear populations, especially given the capacity of bird populations to redistribute in response to increasing predation pressure. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit agent-based model of the predator-prey relationship between polar bears and common eiders, a common and culturally important bird species for northern peoples. Our model is composed of two types of agents (polar bear agents and common eider hen agents) whose movements and decision heuristics are based on species-specific bioenergetic and behavioral ecological principles, and are influenced by historical and extrapolated sea ice conditions. Our model reproduces empirical findings that polar bear predation of bird nests is increasing and predicts an accelerating relationship between advancing ice breakup dates and the number of nests depredated. Despite increases in nest predation, our model predicts that polar bear body condition during the ice-free period will continue to decline. Finally, our model predicts that common eider nests will become more dispersed and will move closer to the mainland in response to increasing predation, possibly increasing their exposure to land-based predators and influencing the livelihood of local people that collect eider eggs and down. These results show that predatorprey interactions can have nonlinear responses to changes in climate and provides important predictions of ecological change in Arctic ecosystems.",,,,,"Dey, Cody/0000-0003-4947-8972","Mitacs Accelerate grant; Baffinlands Iron Mines; Environment and Climate Change Canada, Carleton University; University of Windsor; Weston Foundation; Nunavut Inuit Wildlife Secretariat, ArcticNet Centres of Excellence, Oceans North; Polar Continental Shelf ProjectNatural Resources Canada; PEW Charitable Trust","This research was funded by a Mitacs Accelerate grant (in collaboration with Baffinlands Iron Mines) to HGG and CADS.

State transitions are changes in ecosystem structure and self-reinforcing feedbacks that are initiated when an exogenous driver variable crosses a threshold. Reversing state transitions is difficult and costly. While some state transitions are relatively rapid, many take years to decades. Outside of theoretical models, very little is known about slower state transitions and how they unfold in time and space. 2. We quantified changes in spatial variance as a mesic grassland ecosystem shifts to a shrub-dominated state, using long-term experiments and simulations that maintain grasslands with annual fires or initiate a state transition to shrub dominance by decreasing fire frequency. 3. In the experiments, the susceptibility to state transitions varied substantially in space. In the less frequent fire treatment, some plots became shrub-dominated around year 20 and grass extirpations began in year 25, but a third of the plots were still grass-dominated in year 37. Variable rates of state transition resulted in increasing spatial variance of grass cover over time, whereas shrub cover variance decreased. In the annually burned treatment, grasses remained dominant and the spatial variance of grass cover declined. 4. In a separate experiment, less frequent fires were maintained for 23 years and then switched to annual fires. The switch to annual fires occurred shortly after grass variance started to increase and a majority of these plots quickly returned to a grass dominated state. 5. In simulations, spatial variance remained low and average grass cover was high under frequent fires. If fire frequency decreased below a threshold, the ecosystem transitioned to shrubland, with a transient increase in the spatial variance of grass cover during the transition between states. 6. Synthesis. Spatial variability in the rate and susceptibility to state transitions is indicative of a system with a patchy spatial structure, high spatial heterogeneity and low connectivity between patches. Increases in spatial variance can serve as an indication that some patches have begun a state transition and that management interventions are needed to avoid widespread transitions. This is one of the first empirical examples where altering management after an increase in spatial variance prevented state transitions.",,,,"Ravi, Sujith/C-3586-2008; Brunsell, Nathaniel/G-2904-2012; Collins, Scott/Y-6888-2019","Ravi, Sujith/0000-0002-0425-9373; Brunsell, Nathaniel/0000-0002-4460-8283; Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892; Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X; Ratajczak, Zak/0000-0002-4675-5738",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Kansas State University Division of Biology; The Nature Conservancy; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1402033]; LTER network office 'multi-site synthesis grant',"We thank Ricardo Holdo, Matt Petrie and the reviewers for comments that greatly enhanced the quality and clarity of the manuscript.

A wide range of statistical approaches are employed for the task, including multiple regression models, autoregressive methods, different classes of generalized linear models, mixed model approaches and many others. However, the applicability of these statistical approaches can be limited in specific cases of complex fisheries. We developed a new catch projection model for quota-based fisheries on the West Coast of the U.S. to forecast annual catch and landings for a variety of groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The model projects total and landed catch of each species by individual vessel and for the entire fishing fleet, using a combination of weighted mean vessel attainment rates and historical catch rates, and generates uncertainty intervals. It demonstrated an ability to produce highly accurate predictions at both fleet (R-2 = 0.9847) and vessel levels (R-2 = 0.8447). The model framework contains much built-in versatility, is generalizable enough to serve a variety of quota based applications, and the approach can be tailored to other fisheries around the world. With the proliferation of quota based management of commercial fisheries, tools such as this one are increasingly useful for sustainable management of fishery resources.

As the climate warms, large, frequent, and severe fires are restructuring forested landscapes at large spatial scales, with unknown impacts on imperilled predators. We use the United States federally Threatened Canada lynx as a case study to examine how predators navigate recent large burns, with particular focus on habitat features and the spatial configuration (e.g., distance to edge) that enabled lynx use of these transformed landscapes. We coupled GPS location data of lynx in Washington in an area with several recent large fires and a number of GIS layers of habitat data to develop models of lynx habitat selection in recent burns. Random Forest habitat models showed lynx-selected islands of forest skipped by large fires, residual vegetation, and areas where some trees survived to use newly burned areas. Lynx used burned areas as early as 1 year postfire, which is much earlier than the 2-4 decades postfire previously thought for this predator. These findings are encouraging for predator persistence in the face of fires, but increasingly severe fires or management that reduces postfire residual trees or slow regeneration will likely jeopardize lynx and other predators. Fire management should change to ensure heterogeneity is retained within the footprint of large fires to enable viable predator populations as fire regimes worsen with climate change.",,,,"Hodges, Karen E/K-5598-2012; Murphy, Melanie A/D-2605-2009","Murphy, Melanie A/0000-0002-6589-8929",University of British Columbia; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [312222]; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; Washington Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; U.S. Bureau of Land Management; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"University of British Columbia; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 312222; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; Washington Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Forest Service; U.S. Bureau of Land Management; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",,,11,11,3,76,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Effects of restoration on this broader network of organisms can influence target species both directly and indirectly via changes in energy flow through food webs. To help incorporate these complexities into river restoration planning, we constructed a model that links river food web dynamics to in-stream physical habitat and riparian vegetation conditions. We present an application of the model to the Methow River, Washington, USA, a location of on-going restoration aimed at recovering salmon. Three restoration strategies were simulated: riparian vegetation restoration, nutrient augmentation via salmon carcass addition, and side channel reconnection. We also added populations of nonnative aquatic snails and fish to the modeled food web to explore how changes in food web structure mediate responses to restoration. Simulations suggest that side channel reconnection may be a better strategy than carcass addition and vegetation planting for improving conditions for salmon in this river segment. However, modeled responses were strongly sensitive to changes in the structure of the food web. The addition of nonnative snails and fish modified pathways of energy through the food web, which negated restoration improvements. This finding illustrates that forecasting responses to restoration may require accounting for the structure of food webs, and that changes in this structure, as might be expected with the spread of invasive species, could compromise restoration outcomes. Unlike habitat-based approaches to restoration assessment that focus on the direct effects of physical habitat conditions on single species of interest, our approach dynamically links the success of target organisms to the success of competitors, predators, and prey. By elucidating the direct and indirect pathways by which restoration affects target species, dynamic food web models can improve restoration planning by fostering a deeper understanding of system connectedness and dynamics.",,,,,,U.S. Bureau of Reclamation via an interagency agreement with the USGS [R14PG00049],"We thank Pete Bisson, Jason Dunham, Bret Harvey, Sherri Johnson, Mitch Mumma, Julian Olden, Kathryn Puckett, and three anonymous reviewers for providing detailed reviews that greatly improved the quality of the manuscript.

We quantified the role of hydrologic and environmental variables for influencing species assemblages within two vernal pool landscapes in northeastern California. A novel combination of approaches including remote photography of water depth stage gauges, vegetation sampling along elevation gradients, and topographic surveys were used to measure hydrology and plant community composition at precise locations. Multivariate analyses were used to classify vernal pool plant communities and classification tree analysis was used to model plant community distribution across hydrologic thresholds. Three plant community groups were distinguished according to localized hydrologic regimes. Inundation period and maximum depth were the only variables found to be predictive of plant distribution. Hydrologic thresholds for the three community groups were based on inundation period: Short (< 71 days), Medium (ae<yen> 71 days but < 209 days), and Long (ae<yen> 209 days). The distribution of plant assemblages was strongly correlated with key hydrologic gradients.

A recent study translates Markowitz's risk-diversification strategy from finance to conservation settings, enabling conservation agents to use this diversification strategy for allocating conservation and restoration investments across space to minimize the risk associated with such uncertainty. However, this method is information intensive and requires a large number of forecasts of ecological outcomes associated with possible climate-change scenarios for carrying out fine-resolution conservation planning. We developed a technique for iterative, spatial portfolio analysis that can be used to allocate scarce conservation resources across a desired level of subregions in a planning landscape in the absence of a sufficient number of ecological forecasts. We applied our technique to the Prairie Pothole Region in central North America. A lack of sufficient future climate information prevented attainment of the most efficient risk-return conservation outcomes in the Prairie Pothole Region. The difference in expected conservation returns between conservation planning with limited climate-change information and full climate-change information was as large as 30% for the Prairie Pothole Region even when the most efficient iterative approach was used. However, our iterative approach allowed finer resolution portfolio allocation with limited climate-change forecasts such that the best possible risk-return combinations were obtained. With our most efficient iterative approach, the expected loss in conservation outcomes owing to limited climate-change information could be reduced by 17% relative to other iterative approaches.",,,,"Shah, Payal/G-2933-2015","Shah, Payal/0000-0002-9349-4614","USDA-NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [ILLU-470-353, ILLU-470-323]; USGSUnited States Geological Survey [G12AC20056]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1339944]; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Graduate University (OIST)Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; USGS Climate and Land Use Change Research and Development Program; USGS Ecosystem Program","We thank an anonymous U.

In the theory, the prevalence of a disease and incidence-based mortality are modeled in terms of disease incidence and survival after diagnosis supplemented by information on disease prevalence at the initial age and year available in a dataset. Partitioning of the trends of prevalence and mortality is calculated with minimal assumptions. The resulting expressions for the components of the trends are given by continuous functions of data. The estimator is consistent and stable. The developed methodology is applied for data on type 2 diabetes using individual records from a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries age 65+. Numerical estimates show excellent concordance between empirical estimates and theoretical predictions. Evaluated partitioning model showed that both prevalence and mortality increase with time. The primary driving factors of the observed prevalence increase are improved survival and increased prevalence at age 65. The increase in diabetes-related mortality is driven by increased prevalence and unobserved trends in time-periods and age-groups outside of the range of the data used in the study. Finally, the properties of the new estimator, possible statistical and systematical uncertainties, and future practical applications of this methodology in epidemiology, demography, public health and health forecasting are discussed.

We hypothesized that variability in survival and fecundity, driven by climate variability at different points in the life cycle, scales up from local populations to drive regional characteristics of population cycling and spatial synchronization. Location Forest in the US Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region. Methods We tested hypotheses linking variation in vital rates of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), a declining species that displays decadal population cycles, to temperature and precipitation anomalies and land use intensity, using rate estimates from multiple locations in eastern North America. We used climatedemographic linkages to simulate spatially explicit population dynamics from 1982 to 2069, evaluated predictions against monitoring data and assessed predicted population dynamics under future climate projections. Results Nest success and winter survival were linked to temperature and precipitation anomalies, and demographic models explained important spatiotemporal characteristics of cycling and synchrony in monitoring data. The climate-driven vital rates were necessary for cycling and synchrony in models, even though the four included climate variables were not individually periodic. Cycling and synchrony were stronger at more northerly latitudes, but this transition occurred abruptly, reflecting regional variation in winter conditions. Forecasts suggested climate-driven cycling through mid-century, followed by desynchronization and dampening. Main conclusions Climate variability can drive spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates, and population cycling can result from these relationships. Pathways linking climate to broad-scale population dynamics involve responses of vital rates to several climate variables at different times of year and may be more complex than direct responses to known modes of climate variability. The wide-ranging impact of climate change on the demographics of northerly adapted species has the potential to degrade patterns of population synchrony and cycling.",,,,,,Wisconsin DNR through USFWS Wildlife Restoration [W-160-P-21]; Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative,"Nathan Schumaker gave extensive advice on HexSim parameterization and modelling.

Although local habitat variables influence whether the site is suitable for a given species, the broader landscape context can also influence site occupancy, particularly for species that are sensitive to land-use change. Objectives To examine the relative importance of local versus landscape variables in explaining site occupancy of eight bat species within the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savanna that is experiencing widespread habitat loss and fragmentation. Methods Bats were surveyed within 16 forest patches over two years. We used a multi-model information-theoretic approach, adjusted for species detection bias, to assess whether landscape variables (percent cover and number of patches of natural vegetation within a 2- and 8-km radius of each forest site) or local site variables (canopy cover, understory height, number of trees, and number of lianas) best explained site occupancy in each species. Results Landscape variables were among the best models (Delta AIC(c) or Delta QAIC(c) < 2) for four species (top-ranked model for black myotis), whereas local variables were among the best for five species (top-ranked model for vampire bats). Neither local nor landscape variables explained site occupancy in two frugivorous species. Conclusion Species associated with a particular habitat type will not respond similarly to the amount, distribution or relative suitability of that habitat, or even at the same scale. This reinforces the challenge of species distribution modelling, especially in the context of forecasting species' responses to future land-use or climate-change scenarios.",,,,"De Marco, Paulo/B-2209-2009; With, Kimberly A./J-5124-2014","De Marco, Paulo/0000-0002-3628-6405; With, Kimberly A./0000-0001-5570-1515; Mendes, Poliana/0000-0001-6061-3245","International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science [D-5288-1]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [486057/2012-7, 140648/2011-9, 305542/2010-9]; PELD; Anglo American Group; CAPESCAPES; ''Ciencia sem Fronteiras'' [PDE 249755/2013-0]","The field work was supported by International Foundation for Science (D-5288-1), CNPq (486057/2012-7), PELD, Anglo American Group, and CAPES.

Further, by making dispersal a function of forest area and human population density, variation explained increased to 75.60%, with 74.30% accuracy. These results indicated that a single general dispersal kernel model was sufficient to predict the majority of variation in extent and locational distribution across pest species and that proxies of propagule pressure and habitat invasibility - well-studied predictors of establishment - should also be applied to the dispersal stage.

Spatially detailed modelling of changes in land use, population and transport could help to forecast the impact of scenarios aimed at mitigating the process of urban sprawl. A common problem with land-use change models however, is the lack of historical data for proper model calibration. In this paper we describe an approach for developing historical population density maps by downdating a recent high-resolution population density raster, using a time series of sealed surface data and historical census data as an input. In the proposed approach, we hypothesise a local relationship between increasing population densities and increasing sealed surface fraction estimates, the latter obtained from remote sensing imagery. We apply the method to Flanders, Belgium, a region where population growth and improved transport networks led to a diffuse urban expansion, with ribbon development along many roads and a strong fragmentation of open space. The resulting population and sealed surface maps provide interesting data on the urban sprawl phenomenon in the past decades. By computing a densification index we observe that most urban areas witness a recent population density increase while in several rural areas the built-up area per inhabitant is still growing. The downdated time series of population maps obtained in this study will be used to set up a historical calibration for an activity-based cellular automata model for Flanders and Brussels which, among other data, needs high-resolution population maps.

In this study, the monthly rainfall derived from the satellite-based rainfall product, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS v.2), is compared with observation from 21 ground stations in the NEB, for the period 1981-2013. Various metrics based on pairwise comparison were applied to evaluate its performance in estimating rainfall amount and rain detection capability. Results show that the CHIRPS data correlate well with observations for all stations (r = 0.94), but tend to overestimate low and underestimate high rainfall values (>100 mm/month). Although CHIRPS achieves better results during the wet season (March to May; bias = -4.60%), its ability for the rain detection is poor (probability = 0.44). The best global performance was noted in the Cerrado biome (r = 0.93; rain detection = 0.53), but fails to detect rain in other biomes (r = 0.92; rain detection = 0.16).

The Pliocene is a useful deep-time laboratory for understanding an equilibrium climate state under modern atmospheric CO2, and has been a focus for climate modelers. Accurate estimates of proxy data-model mismatch are hindered by the scarcity of well-constrained observations from well-dated sites in the High Arctic. Using a recently developed community-based approach (Climate Reconstruction Analysis using Coexistence Likelihood Estimation: CRACLE) compared with an established method (The Coexistence Approach: CA), and applied to extraordinary, permafrost-driven preservation of floras, we explore the climate and community assemblages at five Pliocene sites in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The results suggest that climatic differences at this scale do not simply correlate to differences in community assemblage between sites. The threshold temperature for tree line is one important component, but other factors in the environment (e.g., soil characteristics) may drive dissimilarity of communities where the taxa could share the same climate space. Estimates from CRACLE agree with previous estimates where available, and generally fall within the ranges of CA. Mean annual temperatures were similar to 22 degrees C hotter (ranging from 0.8 to 6.2 degrees C by species across sites) and mean annual precipitation similar to 500 mm wetter (ranging from 530 to 860 mm by species across sites) during the Early to ""mid""-Pliocene (similar to 3.6 Ma) when compared with modern climate station data in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Comparison of estimates for three levels of taxonomic input suggest judicious interpretation is needed when generic level identifications are used, especially in the Polar Regions. The results herein are a reminder of the large impact of non-climatic abiotic and biotic factors to be accounted for when predicting future ranges of communities under different climate conditions from the present, and when hindcasting climate from past ecosystem assemblages.",,,,"Fletcher, Tamara/I-3107-2019","Fletcher, Tamara/0000-0001-9066-7834",NSF Division of Polar Programs [1418421],"The authors would like to thank Robert Harbert for assistance with the CRACLE code, Brady Allred for access to computing resources, and Annie Cooper for assisting with statistics.

Here, we test if growth rates can be predicted from morphological traits for a highly diverse group of colonial symbiotic organisms: scleractinian corals. We ask whether growth is isometric or allometric among corals, and whether most variation in coral growth rates occurs at the level of the species or morphological group. We estimate growth as change in planar area for 11 species, across five morphological groups and over 5 years. We show that coral growth rates are best predicted from colony size and morphology rather than species. Coral size follows a power scaling law with a constant exponent of 0.91. Despite being colonial organisms, corals have consistent allometric scaling in growth. This consistency simplifies the task of projecting community responses to disturbance and climate change.",,,,"Baird, Andrew Hamilton/C-8449-2009; Dornelas, Maria/E-3595-2010; Connolly, Sean/E-7773-2011","Baird, Andrew Hamilton/0000-0001-8504-4077; Madin, Joshua/0000-0002-5005-6227; Dornelas, Maria/0000-0003-2077-7055; Connolly, Sean/0000-0003-1537-0859",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Scottish Funding Council (MASTS) [HR09011]; ERC project bioTIME [250189],"We thank the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and the Australian Research Council for fellowship and research support.

Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.",,,,,,"US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2015-67013-23138]","This project was supported by a grant by the US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Award # 2015-67013-23138).

A fatty acid trophic marker strategy was used to unravel the diet composition of Antarctic harpacticoid copepod species or assemblages collected from distinct habitats in summer.

Future climate change projections through 2070 indicate significant shifts in MAT and MAP for the iPNW. We assessed surface (0-10 cm) soil organic C and N as well as active and recalcitrant fractions of SOM within long-term experiments representing different tillage regimes and cropping intensities across the current climatic gradient of the iPNW. We discovered that current levels of soil C and N as well as various SOM fractions were positively correlated with MAP and negatively correlated with MAT. Furthermore, these climatic drivers were more influential than either tillage regime or cropping intensity in determining SOM levels and characteristics. Soil organic C and total N as well as the hydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable fractions were negatively correlated with the current ratio of MAT to MAP, called the climate ratio.

This pressure puts small remote northern communities at risk due to limited existing freshwater supply. The lack of baseline knowledge of existing supply, demand, or reservoir recharge potential increases this risk. We therefore address this knowledge gap through a water resource assessment of municipal supply over a 20 year planning horizon in two communities in Arctic Canada using a novel heuristic model and existing data sources. We generated climate and demand scenarios to identify the mechanisms of drawdown as well as examine the influences on replenishment. We found a pronounced vulnerability to reduced winter precipitation and (or) increased ice thickness of reservoirs.

These models can be parameterized using empirical data, but sometimes require information elicited from experts. When evaluating the effects of disease in species translocation programs, expert judgment is likely to play a role because complete empirical information will rarely be available. We illustrate development of a decision-analytic model built to inform decision-making regarding translocations and other management actions for the boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas), a species with declines linked to chytridiomycosis caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Using the model, we explored the management implications of major uncertainties in this system, including whether there is a genetic basis for resistance to pathogenic infection by Bd, how translocation can best be implemented, and the effectiveness of efforts to reduce the spread of Bd. Our modeling exercise suggested that while selection for resistance to pathogenic infection by Bd could increase numbers of sites occupied by toads, and translocations could increase the rate of toad recovery, efforts to reduce the spread of Bd may have little effect.

As grasslands are primarily water-limited, these changes in climate will likely have dramatic impacts on ecosystem function and community structure, yet the magnitude of change and the types of species favoured may differ among ecosystems or even among local communities within ecosystems. How much might plant community responses to altered precipitation vary at two sites within one grassland region? LocationSemi-arid and sub-humid natural grasslands in the US Great Plains. MethodsAt two sites we used rainfall shelters and irrigation to create irrigation, drought and control treatments. We measured changes in species composition, richness, Shannon's diversity, evenness and cover by plant functional groups across 4yr (2008-2011). ResultsThe semi-arid grassland community was relatively insensitive to precipitation manipulations, and in the few cases where there was a significant relationship between treatment precipitation and the response variable, the slope of the relationship was weak. In contrast, the sub-humid grassland community was very sensitive to changes in treatment precipitation throughout the experiment, and responded more strongly, and negatively, to drought compared to irrigation. ConclusionsThe differing sensitivity of the dominant species to altered precipitation amount appears to largely determine the overall differences in community response at these sites. The variable responses we observed within a single grassland region highlight the challenge of forecasting community impacts of climate change.",,,,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1027319]; Nature Conservancy provided,"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 1027319).

Although mixedwoods have been shown to have greater resource use efficiency relative to pure stands, considerable uncertainty remains with respect to the underlying ecological processes. We explored species interactions in Scots pine/European beech mixedwoods with the process-based model FORECAST Climate. The model was calibrated for two contrasting forests in the southwestern Pyrenees (northern Spain): a wet Mediterranean site at 625m.a.s.l. and a subalpine site at 1335m.a.s.l. Predicted mixedwood yield was higher than that for beech stands but lower than pine stands. When simulating climate change, mixedwood yield was reduced at the Mediterranean site (-33%) but increased at the subalpine site (+11%). Interaction effects were enhanced as stands developed. Complementarity dominated the Mediterranean stand but neutral or net competition dominated the subalpine stand, which had higher stand density and water availability. Reduced water demand and consumption, increased canopy interception, and improved water-use efficiency in mixtures compared to beech stands, suggest a release of beech intraspecific competition. Beech also facilitated pine growth through better litter quality, nonsymbiotic nitrogen fixation, and above- and belowground stratification, leading to higher foliar nitrogen content and deeper canopies in pines. In conclusion, mixtures may improve water availability and use efficiency for beech and light interception for pine, the main limiting factors for each species, respectively. Encouraging pine-beech mixtures could be an effective adaptation to climate change in drought-prone sites in the Mediterranean region.",,,,"de Andres, Ester Gonzalez/AAH-3710-2019; Blanco, Juan A./A-4554-2009; Lo, Yueh Hsin/D-2582-2010","Blanco, Juan A./0000-0002-6524-4335; Lo, Yueh Hsin/0000-0001-6444-0273; Gonzalez de Andres, Ester/0000-0001-7951-5426",Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2011-08082]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2012-33465];  [EEBB-I-15-09220];  [BES-2013-066705],"Ramon y Cajal contract, Grant/Award Number: RYC-2011-08082; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: AGL2012-33465; mobility aid, Grant/Award Number: EEBB-I-15-09220; Spanish Predoctoral Research Grant, Grant/Award Number: BES-2013-066705",,,20,20,2,27,,,,1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,MAR,2017,10,2,,,SI,,,,e1810,10.1002/eco.1810,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,,,WOS:000395631100006,,,,,

Successful local colonization depends on both species dispersal range and how local habitat conditions affect establishment success. Moreover, there is limited understanding of the effects of different spatiotemporal landscape properties on future metapopulation size. We investigate which factors drive the future metapopulation size of the epiphytic model lichen species Lobaria pulmonaria in a managed forest landscape. First, we test the importance of dispersal and local conditions on the colonization-extinction dynamics of the species using Bayesian state-space modelling of a large-scale data set collected over a 10-yr period. Second, we test the importance of dispersal and establishment limitation in explaining establishment probability and subsequent local population growth, based on a 10-yr propagule sowing experiment. Third, we test how future metapopulation size is affected by different metapopulation and spatiotemporal landscape dynamics, using simulations with the metapopulation models fitted to the empirical data. The colonization probability increased with tree inclination and connectivity, with a mean dispersal distance of 97 m (95% credible intervals, 5-530 m). Local extinctions were mainly deterministic set by tree mortality, but also by tree cutting by forestry. No experimental establishments took place on clearcuts, and in closed forest the establishment probability was higher on trees growing on moist than on dry-mesic soils. The subsequent local population growth rate increased with increasing bark roughness. The simulations showed that the restricted dispersal range estimated (compared to non-restricted dispersal range), and short tree rotation length (65 yr instead of 120) had approximately the same negative effects on future metapopulation size, while regeneration of trees creating a random tree pattern instead of an aggregated one had only some negative effect. However, using the colonization rate obtained with the experimentally added diaspores led to a considerable increase in metapopulation size, making the dispersal limitation of the species clear. The future metapopulation size is thus set by the number of host trees located in shady conditions, not isolated from occupied trees, and by the rotation length of these host trees.",,,,"Varkonyi, Gergely/I-2310-2012; Mair, Louise/AAL-4986-2020","Varkonyi, Gergely/0000-0002-7977-2753; Mair, Louise/0000-0002-7419-7200; Harrison, Philip J/0000-0003-4046-9017",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"We thank I.

Our current understanding of the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation is based largely on studies that focus on either short-term or long-term responses. Short-term responses are often used to predict long-term responses and make management decisions. The lack of studies comparing short-and long-term responses to fragmentation means we do not adequately understand when and how well short-term responses can be extrapolated to predict long-term responses, and when or why they cannot. To address this gap, we used data from one of the world's longest-running fragmentation experiments, The Wog Wog Habitat Fragmentation Experiment. Using data for carabid beetles, we found that responses in the long term (more than 22 yr post-fragmentation approximate to 22 generations) often contrasted markedly with those in the short term (5 yr post-fragmentation). The total abundance of all carabids, species richness and the occurrence of six species declined in the short term in the fragments but increased over the long term. The occurrence of three species declined initially and continued to decline, whilst another species was positively affected initially but decreased in the long term. Species' responses to the matrix that surrounds the fragments strongly predicted both the direction (increase/decline in occurrence) and magnitude of their responses to fragmentation. Additionally, species' responses to the matrix were somewhat predicted by their preferences for different types of native habitat (open vs. shaded). Our study highlights the degree of the matrix's influence in fragmented landscapes, and how this influence can change over time. We urge caution in using short-term responses to forecast long-term responses in cases where the matrix (1) impacts species' responses to fragmentation (by isolating them, creating new habitat or altering fragment habitat) and (2) is likely to change through time.",,,,; /K-4907-2012,"MELBOURNE, BRETT/0000-0002-8843-4131; Driscoll, Don/0000-0002-1560-5235; /0000-0003-2415-0057","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1350872, DEB 0841892]; Australian National UniversityAustralian National University","We would like to thank Joanne McMillan, Brett Howland, Kika Tuff, Ty Tuff, Andrew King, Jeff McClenahan, Erin Polka, and Mandy King for invaluable help in the field and lab.

Monitoring colony recovery from bleaching disturbances over multiyear time frames is important for improving predictions of future coral community changes. However, there are currently few multiyear studies describing long-term outcomes for coral colonies following acute bleaching events. We recorded colony pigmentation and size for bleached and unbleached groups of co-located conspecifics of three major reef-building scleractinian corals (Orbicella franksi, Siderastrea siderea, and Stephanocoenia michelini; n=198 total) in Bocas del Toro, Panama, during the major 2005 bleaching event and then monitored pigmentation status and changes live tissue colony size for 8years (2005-2013). Corals that were bleached in 2005 demonstrated markedly different response trajectories compared to unbleached colony groups, with extensive live tissue loss for bleached corals of all species following bleaching, with mean live tissue losses per colony 9 months postbleaching of 26.2% (+/- 5.4 SE) for O. franksi, 35.7% (+/- 4.7 SE) for S. michelini, and 11.2% (+/- 3.9 SE) for S. siderea. Two species, O. franksi and S. michelini, later recovered to net positive growth, which continued until a second thermal stress event in 2010. Following this event, all species again lost tissue, with previously unbleached colony species groups experiencing greater declines than conspecific sample groups, which were previously bleached, indicating a possible positive acclimative response. However, despite this beneficial effect for previously bleached corals, all groups experienced substantial net tissue loss between 2005 and 2013, indicating that many important Caribbean reef-building corals will likely suffer continued tissue loss and may be unable to maintain current benthic coverage when faced with future thermal stress forecast for the region, even with potential benefits from bleaching-related acclimation.",,,,,"Treibitz, Tali/0000-0002-3078-282X; Kline, David/0000-0001-5128-9439; Mitchell, B.

We projected models to potential future climate conditions using five representative general circulation models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). We used Random Forests to model probabilities of occurrence and compared the time periods 1981-2010 (hindcast) and 2041-2070 (forecast) in ""model space."" Projected changes in shorebird probabilities of occurrence varied with species-specific general distribution pattern, migration distance, and spatial extent. Species using the western and northern portion of the study area exhibited the greatest likelihoods of decline, whereas species with more easterly occurrences, mostly long-distance migrants, had the greatest projected increases in probability of occurrence. At an ecoregional extent, differences in probabilities of shorebird occurrence ranged from -0.015 to 0.045 when averaged across climate models, with the largest increases occurring early in migration. Spatial shifts are predicted for several shorebird species. Probabilities of occurrence of wintering Mallards and Northern Pintail are predicted to increase by 0.046 and 0.061, respectively, with northward shifts projected for both species.

Droughts, or prolonged periods of precipitation deficiency, are characteristic of most temperate grasslands, yet few experiments have explored how variation in the seasonal timing of drought may impact ecosystem function. We investigated the response of above- and belowground net primary production (ANPP & BNPP) to altered drought timing in a mesic grassland in NE Kansas. Moderate drought treatments (25% reduction from the mean growing season precipitation [GSP]) were imposed by erecting rainout shelters in late spring (LSP), early summer (ESM), and mid-summer (MSM, n = 10 plots/treatment). These treatments were compared to two controls (long-term average GSP [LTA] and ambient GSP [AMB]) and a wet treatment (+30% of the long-term average GSP [WET]). We found that LSP drought did not significantly reduce ANPP relative to control plots while the ESM and MSM drought did despite equivalent reductions in soil moisture. In contrast, the WET treatment did not affect ANPP. Neither the WET nor the drought treatments altered BNPP as compared to the controls.

Our goal is to make a forecast of this parameter in Central Europe's most important river with the use of other, easily measurable water quality parameters (pH, temperature, electrical conductivity and runoff) with the use of linear and nonlinear models. We adapt four models for forecasting dissolved oxygen concentration, namely a Multivariate Linear Regression model, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network and a General Regression Neural Network model. Data is available for Hungarian sampling locations on River Danube (Mohacs, Fajsz and Gyorzamoly) for the period of 1998-2003. The analysis was performed with four alternative combinations, the models were formulated using data from the period 1998-2002 and a dissolved oxygen forecast was made for 2003. Evaluating model performance with various statistical measures (root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and Willmott's index of agreement), we found that nonlinear models gave better results than linear models. In two cases the General Regression Neural Network provided the best performance, in two other cases the Radial Basis Function Neural Network gave the best results. A further goal was to conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the parameter with the highest influence on the performance of the created models. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the combination of all three sampling locations (4th combination) and it was found that for all three neural network models sensitivity analyses showed that pH has the most important role in estimating dissolved oxygen content.

Incorporating ES concepts into the decision making process has been shown to support resilient and functional ecosystems. Coupling land change and ES models allows for insights into the impacts and anticipated trade-offs of specific policy decisions. The spatial configuration of urbanization likely influences the delivery and production of ES. When considering multiple ES simultaneously, improving the production of one ecosystem service often results in the decrease in the provision of other ES, giving rise to trade-offs. We examine the impact of three urban growth scenarios on several ES to determine the degree to which spatial configuration of urbanization and the development of natural land cover impacts these services over 25 years. We couple land change and ES models to examine impacts to carbon sequestration, surface water-run off, nitrogen and phosphorus export, organic farming and camping site suitability, to determine trade-offs among the six ES associated with each spatial configuration for western North Carolina. Consequences of urban configurations are dramatic, with degraded ES across all scenarios and substantial variation depending on urban pattern, revealing trade-offs. Counter-intuitive trade-offs between carbon sequestration and lands available for organic farming and camping were observed, suggesting that no configurations result in mutual benefits for all ES. By understanding trade-offs associated with urban configurations, decision makers can identify ES critical to an area and promote configurations that enhance those.",,,,,"Meentemeyer, Ross/0000-0002-1247-6212; Petrasova, Anna/0000-0002-5120-5538; Van Berkel, Derek/0000-0002-1001-783X",,,,,18,18,8,85,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Such projections are challenging because the effects of OA may be enhanced, reduced or even reversed by other environmental stressors or interactions among species. Despite an increasing emphasis on multifactor and multispecies studies in global change biology, our ability to forecast outcomes at higher levels of organization remains low. Much of our failure lies in a poor mechanistic understanding of nonlinear responses, a lack of specificity regarding the levels of organization at which interactions can arise, and an incomplete appreciation for linkages across these levels. To move forward, we need to fully embrace interactions. Mechanistic studies on physiological processes and individual performance in response to OA must be complemented by work on population and community dynamics. We must also increase our understanding of how linkages and feedback among multiple environmental stressors and levels of organization can generate nonlinear responses to OA.

Use of the term 'big data' implies an approach that includes capacity to aggregate, search, cross-reference, and mine large volumes of data to generate new understanding that can inform decision-making about emergent properties of complex systems. Although big-data approaches are not a panacea, there are large-scale environmental questions for which big data are well suited, even necessary. Ecosystems are complex biophysical systems that are not easily defined by any one data type, location, or time. Understanding complex ecosystem properties is data intensive along axes of volume (size of data), velocity (frequency of data), and variety (diversity of data types). Ecosystem scientists have employed impressive technology for generating high-frequency, large-volume data streams. Yet important challenges remain in both theoretical and infrastructural development to support visualization and analysis of large and diverse data. The way forward includes greater support for network science approaches, and for development of big-data infrastructure that includes capacity for visualization and analysis of integrated data products.

The purpose of this study was to adapt, calibrate, and validate the PILOTE model on globe artichokes (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.) under drip irrigation in the Lower Cheliff Plain (Algeria) in two seasons (2011/2012 and 2012/2013) and to use it to predict soil water reserves and total biomass in other seasons (2006/2007, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011). The model uses daily climate data, soil characteristics, and plant data to simulate the leaf area index, total biomass, and soil water reserves during the crop growth cycle. Our results revealed a strong correlation between model outputs and observed data (leaf area index, soil water reserves, and plant biomass) in the calibration and validation years (coefficient of efficiency >0.90 and root mean square error <9.40), confirming the model's ability to well predict biomass, including that of globe artichokes, and dry matter in a semiarid climate. The model was also run to predict total biomass under different climatic conditions with total rainfall ranging from 160 to 383 mm (6 to 15 in).The results suggest that total rainfall amount plays a major role in horticultural production even if irrigation is applied.We can conclude also that the PILOTE model can be recommended for use in this type of climate for the management of irrigation.",,,,,,French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [CEP S 11/09],"The study was partly financed in the, framework of the project ""Groundwater Arena"" (CEP S 11/09), financed by the French National Research Agency.",,,0,0,0,5,,,,0022-4561,1941-3300,,J SOIL WATER CONSERV,J.

Prospective evaluations of how effectively such policies are likely to meet sustainability goals have nonetheless remained challenging. Evaluating policies against sustainability goals can be facilitated through the inclusive wealth framework, which characterizes development in terms of the value to society of its underlying capital assets, and defines development to be potentially sustainable if that value does not decline over time. The inclusive wealth approach has been developed at a theoretical level and applied to retrospective evaluations. Here, we apply inclusive wealth theory to prospective policy evaluation coupled with dynamic simulation modeling, using a case of electricity infrastructure policies in oil-exporting countries. To demonstrate the prospective evaluation, we analyze investment policies in non-fossil electricity capacity in terms of their forecast impact on several dimensions of inclusive wealth. Illustrative results show that investing in non-fossil capacity in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can increase components of the countries' inclusive wealth, though the impacts depend on future uncertainties. In contrast, comparable components of the UAE's net inclusive wealth decline under similar investment policies. Finally, including human capital improvements in estimates of inclusive wealth substantially increases its value, though the amount varies across the countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the potential consequences of climate change on the geographical distribution of five native bee species and estimate the possible effects of bee distribution shifts on tomato crops in Brazil. Ensemble forecasting was implemented through five algorithms in two carbon emission scenarios to predict range shifts for five tomato-visiting bee species for the year 2100. We then calculated the total tomato crop area in the cells with at least 50% bee suitability, for each bee species, in each scenario. Results showed that all species will undergo a reduction in suitable areas in both scenarios. Bombus mono had the greatest area reduction in 2100 under the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios: near 38% and 71%, respectively. Centris tarsata had the smaller area reduction under the same scenarios: 8.5% and 19.5% respectively. The high agreement between tomato crops and bee distribution observed in the present will also be reduced in both Scenarios for all species, especially in the pessimistic scenario. B. mono had the highest reduction in range due to habitat suitability and will be restricted to some parts of southeastern and southern Brazil. Over 60% of the tomato crop area presently within the distribution of B. mono will become climatically unsuitable in the pessimistic emission scenario. This study indicates that the predicted climate change may negatively impact several species associated with tomato crops in Brazil by the year 2100. This is troubling, as it could result in tomato production losses, which would bring economic and environmental losses to the tomato-producing regions with implications for pollinator conservation.

As a key component of marine ecosystems, changes in zoo-plankton dynamics could have a significant effect on ecosystem structures and fisheries production. We developed an individual-based model of a dominant coastal copepod, Acartia tonsa, to explore IV in sustaining a copepod population. We also examined the effects on the population dynamics under different levels of temperature, salinity, and food concentration. Abundance, egg production, and population survival of the species were used as metrics to measure population success. Our simulations suggested that the 3 environmental factors significantly influence the population dynamics of A. tonsa, and IV has implications for population regulation and resilience under unfavorable environmental conditions.

Will specialists track changes in their habitats as a group, or are their distributions governed by landscape gradients that will make some species more sensitive to habitat changes? In this study, we forecasted the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on two salt marsh specialist bird species: clapper rails Rallus crepitans and seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus. We sampled the abundance of these two species in salt marshes throughout the Georgia, USA, coast in 2013-2014, and analyzed count data using a Bayesian N-mixture model. Model predictions were applied to an SLR land cover model to determine distribution shifts over 100 years. Both species distributions were most sensitive to the relative elevation gradient, with clapper rails using lower elevation marshes and seaside sparrows using higher elevation marshes. These disparities in habitat use, along with other differences according to marsh salinity and distance to forested areas, led to divergent responses to SLR. Clapper rail habitat is predicted to increase with SLR by 52%, but seaside sparrow habitat will contract by 81% by the year 2100. Seaside sparrow habitat is not predicted to decline until sometime between 2025 and 2050, at which point the decline will rapidly accelerate, indicating the importance of careful monitoring in future decades. Diverging responses to a global perturbation create a conservation planning dilemma: if specialists have opposing responses to SLR, it may be difficult to manage conservation areas that accommodate many species.",,,,,,United States Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center through the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative; Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR); United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project [GEOZ-0146-MS]; University of Georgia PhD Scholars of Excellence Assistantship,"This research was funded by the United States Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center through the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR), and the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project GEOZ-0146-MS.

In the 21st century, urban development and sea level rise (SLR) are predicted to affect large areas of the United States, further exacerbating already fragmented and densely populated landscapes. Increasing or restoring habitat connectivity may ameliorate these effects, but the broad-reaching efforts required to assess current and future changes to connectivity, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to SLR, are still under development. To address these issues, we strategically identified a small group of regionally significant species that represent a range of characteristics and ecological requirements useful for examining landscape connectivity. We used expert opinion to parameterize divergent species responses (i.e. resistance) to landscape features and to assess permeability of the landscape. From this, we estimated contemporary and future low-resistance habitat cores in the year 2100. We modeled six species for habitat connectivity using a multiscaled circuit theory-based approach and analysed them collectively to indicate landscape connectivity across the Southeastern United States. Using this approach, we were able to forecast changing connectivity patterns based on predicted urbanization and SLR. Our results suggest that there will be a 41% reduction in the number of low-resistance cores and a 35% decrease in mean area of remaining cores. In addition, current areas of high landscape connectivity will become more fragmented as future connectivity values indicate a more homogenized landscape structure. In the future landscape, pathways for connectivity are likely to move inland and northward as sea level and urbanization pressures increase. Our results may inform more comprehensive planning initiatives regionally or nationally, while simultaneously providing a multiscaled context for localized planning efforts.",,,,,"Leonard, Paul/0000-0001-8032-7449",South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative [20111509]; department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation at Clemson University,"We thank the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative for providing primary funding for this work (Cooperative Agreement # 20111509) and appreciate the input and feedback from cooperative staff throughout this project.

The number and complexity of experiments examining the effects of OA has substantially increased over the past decade, in an attempt to address multi-stressor interactions and long-term responses in an increasing range of aquatic organisms. However, differences in the response of males and females to elevated pCO(2) have been investigated in fewer than 4% of studies to date, often being precluded by the difficulty of determining sex non-destructively, particularly in early life stages. Herewe highlight that sex can significantly impact organismresponses to OA, differentially affecting physiology, reproduction, biochemistry and ultimately survival. What is more, these impacts do not always conform to ecological theory based on differential resource allocation towards reproduction, which would predict females to be more sensitive to OA owing to the higher production cost of eggs compared with sperm. Therefore, non-sex-specific studies may overlook subtle but ecologically significant differences in the responses of males and females to OA, with consequences for forecasting the fate of natural populations in a near-future ocean.",,,,"Dupont, Sam T/F-5527-2013","Davison, William/0000-0003-0501-8851; A, Mauricio/0000-0001-8040-6147; Widdicombe, Stephen/0000-0002-0598-0234; Calosi, Piero/0000-0003-3378-2603; Ellis, Robert/0000-0002-3117-0075; Queiros, Ana/0000-0002-7067-3177","BBSRC grants [BB/N013344/1, BB/M017583/1]; NERC-DEFRA Marine Ecosystems Research Programme [NE/L003279/1]",R.P.E. was funded by BBSRC grants (BB/N013344/1 and BB/M017583/1) awarded to R.W.W.

While climate warming occurs over a background of variation due to cyclical processes and irregular events, the temporal structure of the thermal environment is largely ignored when forecasting the dynamics of non-native species. Ecological theory predicts that high levels of temporal autocorrelation in the environment - relatedness between conditions occurring in close temporal proximity - will favor populations that would otherwise have an average negative growth rate by increasing the duration of favorable environmental periods. Here, we invoke such theory to explain the success of biological invasions and evaluate the hypothesis that sustained periods of high environmental temperature can act synergistically with increases in mean temperature to favor the establishment of non-native species. We conduct a 60-day field mesocosm experiment to measure the population dynamics of the non-native cladoceran zooplankter Daphnia lumholtzi and a native congener Daphnia pulex in ambient temperature environments (control), warmed with recurrent periods of high environmental temperatures (uncorrelated-warmed), or warmed with sustained periods of high environmental temperatures (autocorrelated-warmed), such that both warmed treatments exhibited the same mean temperature but exhibited different temporal structures of their thermal environments. Maximum D.lumholtzi densities in the warmed-autocorrelated treatment were threefold and eightfold higher relative to warmed-uncorrelated and control treatments, respectively. Yet, D.lumholtzi performed poorly across all experimental treatment(s) relative to D.pulex and were undetectable (by) the end of the experiment. Using mathematical models, we show that this increase in performance can occur alongside increasing temporal autocorrelation and should occur over a broad range of warming scenarios. These results provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that the temporal structure of the environment can influence the performance of species undergoing range expansions due to climate warming.",,,,,,James S.

Previous data had indicated that the breeding phenology of a population of Fowler's Toads (Anaxyrus fowleri) at their northern range limit had been progressively later in spring, contrary to generally observed trends in other species. Although these animals are known to respond to environmental temperature and the lunar cycle to commence breeding, the timing of breeding should also be influenced by the onset of overwintering animals' prior upward movement through the soil column from beneath the frost line as winter becomes spring. I used recorded weather data to identify four factors of temperature, rainfall and snowfall in late winter and early spring that correlated with the toads' eventual date of emergence aboveground. Estimated dates of spring emergence of the toads calculated using a predictive model based on these factors, as well as the illumination of the moon, were highly correlated with observed dates of emergence over 24 consecutive years. Using the model to estimate of past dates of spring breeding (i.e. retrodiction) indicated that even three decades of data were insufficient to discern any appreciable phenological trend in these toads. However, by employing weather data dating back to 1876, I detected a significant trend over 140years towards earlier spring emergence by the toads by less than half a day/decade, while, over the same period of time, average annual air temperature and annual precipitation had both increased. Changes in the springtime breeding phenology for late-breeding species, such as Fowler's Toads, therefore may conform to expectations of earlier breeding under global warming. Improved understanding of the environmental cues that bring organisms out of winter dormancy will enable better interpretation of long-term phenological trends.",,,,,,NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; World Wildlife Fund Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; Wildlife Preservation Canada; Canadian Wildlife Federation,"Permission to study toads at Long Point was granted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Ontario Parks, and the Canadian Wildlife Service.

However, we still lack a broad understanding of the mechanisms underlying the establishment of non-indigenous species that combines both perspectives. Since the opening of the Suez Canal, hundreds of species have invaded the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, forming a unique system in which the entire species pool (donor, non-indigenous and recipient) is known. Focusing on species ecological traits, we assess the drivers underlying the establishment of non-indigenous species from the onset of the invasion to the present. LocationThe Mediterranean and Red Seas. MethodsWe compiled traits for shallow-water hard-bottom-associated fishes in the Mediterranean (recipient community) and the Red Sea (donor community). We compared the multivariate community trait structure of non-indigenous species with the donor and recipient assemblages, using a novel method to objectively assign trait-weights, thereby increasing the robustness of the results. Patterns were contrasted with two types of null models which provide distinct insights into the ecological processes. ResultsNon-indigenous fishes are very diverse ecologically, substantially increasing the total community trait diversity of the Mediterranean. Trait similarity between non-indigenous and indigenous Mediterranean species was lower than expected, indicating that non-indigenous fishes tend to occupy relatively vacant niches within the Mediterranean. However, we further found that over time non-indigenous species display increased trait similarity to indigenous Mediterranean species. This suggests that trait constraints associated with successful establishment are weakening. Main conclusionsNon-indigenous species establish in relatively vacant ecological niches, opening the possibility for predicting establishment using ecological traits. However, the weakening of trait constraints through time suggests that forecasting future establishment may be difficult. Faced with an accelerating pace of invasion, it appears that the Mediterranean is going to be transformed into an extension of the Red Sea in terms of trait and species composition.",,,,"Belmaker, Jonathan/I-1004-2019","Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359; Givan, Or/0000-0002-6364-3279; Parravicini, Valeriano/0000-0002-3408-1625","GIF, the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and DevelopmentGerman-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [I-2373-203.13/2014]; Marie Curie Integration [614352]; Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [1356/15]","We would like to thank Shane Blowes, Maria Beger and two anonymous referees for constructive comments.

Drylands represent our planet's largest terrestrial biome and, due to their extensive area, maintain large stocks of carbon (C). Accordingly, understanding how dryland C cycling will respond to climate change is imperative for accurately forecasting global C cycling and future climate. However, it remains difficult to predict how increased temperature will affect dryland C cycling, as substantial uncertainties surround the potential responses of the two main C fluxes: plant photosynthesis and soil CO2 efflux. In addition to a need for an improved understanding of climate effects on individual dryland C fluxes, there is also notable uncertainty regarding how climate change may influence the relationship between these fluxes. 2. To address this important knowledge gap, we measured a growing season's in situ photosynthesis, plant biomass accumulation and soil CO2 efflux of mature Achnatherum hymenoides (a common and ecologically important C-3 bunchgrass growing throughout western North America) exposed to ambient or elevated temperature (+ 2 degrees C above ambient, warmed via infrared lamps) for 3 years. 3. The 2 degrees C increase in temperature caused a significant reduction in photosynthesis, plant growth and soil CO2 efflux. Of important note, photosynthesis and soil respiration appeared tightly coupled and the relationship between these fluxes was not altered by the elevated temperature treatment, suggesting C fixation's strong control of both above-ground and belowground dryland C cycling. Leaf water use efficiency was substantially increased in the elevated temperature treatment compared to the control treatment. 4. Taken together, our results suggest notable declines in photosynthesis with relatively subtle warming, reveal strong coupling between above-and below-ground C fluxes in this dryland and highlight temperature's strong effect on fundamental components of dryland C and water cycles.",,,,,"Reed, Sasha/0000-0002-8597-8619","U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC-0008168]; U.S. Geological Survey Climate and Land Use Change and Ecosystems Mission Areas","We would like to thank Ed Grote for assistance with experimental design and set-up, Hilda Smith, Elizabeth Ogata, Kristina Young, Emily Harrison and Philip Adams for assistance with measurements.

Generally, either a single model from one algorithm or an ensemble of single models from different algorithms is used to provide a prediction. In addition to variability among algorithms, recent studies have shown the need to consider variability within a single algorithm, for example optimizing model complexity by tuning model settings. We present an ensemble ENM using a single-algorithm approach, while adjusting model settings to maximize performance. Location Madagascar. Methods We used MAXENT, bioclimatic variables and occurrence records of four species of Malagasy tenrecs (Family Tenrecidae). We calibrated and evaluated preliminary models using a jackknife approach, tuning two model settings to estimate optimal model complexity. We chose a suite of top-performing preliminary models and then generated a consensus prediction. Furthermore, we calculated the variability among predictions of the co-optimal models to indicate variation in geography (i.e. uncertainty). We then did the same after projecting the predictions to climatic estimates for the Last Glacial Maximum and the year 2070. Results The default settings were never identified as optimal for any of the four species. The model settings considered as the co-optimal solutions essentially led to the same evaluation statistics; however, they showed high variation in their geographic predictions for three of the four species. Additionally, variation among such models was greater when transferred across time. Main conclusions This approach likely can provide better predictions for a single algorithm as well as quantifications of within-algorithm uncertainty, qualities that are highly useful in interpreting reconstructed suitable areas or forecasts of potential range shifts under future climate change. Finally, this within-algorithm uncertainty can be integrated into a larger framework that considers variability due to other factors (e.g. related to input data, alternate algorithms or various Global circulation models).",,,,"Anderson, Robert P./AAG-2871-2019","Anderson, Robert P./0000-0002-7706-4649","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1119915, DEB-1120904]; Luis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Bridge to Doctorate Fellowship)","This research was made possible by funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF DEB-1119915 to R.P.A. and DEB-1120904 to L.E.O.) and the Luis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Bridge to Doctorate Fellowship to R.A.B.).

Consequently, warming could benefit many high-latitude and high-altitude insects by increasing opportunities for foraging or oviposition. However, warming can also alter species interactions, including interactions with natural enemies, making the net effect of rising temperatures on population growth rate difficult to predict. We investigated the temperature-dependence of nesting activity and lifetime reproductive output over 3 yr in subalpine populations of a pollen-specialist bee, Osmia iridis. Rates of nest provisioning increased with ambient temperatures and with availability of floral resources, as expected. However, warmer conditions did not increase lifetime reproductive output. Lifetime offspring production was best explained by rates of brood parasitism (by the wasp Sapyga), which increased with temperature. Direct observations of bee and parasite activity suggest that although activity of both species is favored by warmer temperatures, bees can be active at lower ambient temperatures, while wasps are active only at higher temperatures. Thus, direct benefits to the bees of warmer temperatures were nullified by indirect costs associated with increased parasite activity. To date, most studies of climate-change effects on pollinators have focused on changing interactions between pollinators and their floral host-plants (i.e., bottom-up processes). Our results suggest that natural enemies (i.e., top-down forces) can play a key role in pollinator population regulation and should not be overlooked in forecasts of pollinator responses to climate change.",,,,"Forrest, Jessica/A-6290-2010","Forrest, Jessica/0000-0002-5273-9339",University of Ottawa; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; RMBL,"We thank P.

However, little is known about how plant species ranges, richness and phylogenetic diversity of continents will be affected by these dynamics. We address this gap here by examining the patterns of species' distributions and phylogenetic relationships for 7465 seed plant taxa in North America. An ensemble of species distribution models was used to estimate the potential suitable habitat of species under different sets of climate, land-use and dispersal constraint scenarios. We then evaluated the vulnerability and extinction risk of individual species to changes in climate and land use, and examined whether rare, endangered and evolutionarily distinct species were disproportionally threatened by climate and land-use change. We show that similar to 2000 species may lose >80% of their suitable habitats under the A1b emission scenario for the 2080s, while similar to 100 species may experience >80% range expansions (a 20:1 ratio of loss to gain). When considering >50% range retraction and expansion, the ratio of loss to gain was 13:1. A greater loss of species diversity is expected at low latitudes, while larger gains are expected at high latitudes. Evolutionarily distinct species are predicted to have significantly higher extinction risks than extant species.

We demonstrated that seasonal forecasts can be used to optimize water resources management and increase supply. Using El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to forecast the wet seasons (winter and summer) can provide information during extreme ENSO. We found that ENSO is a better indicator for dryer than normal winters during La Nina and dryer than normal summers during El Nino. As in indicator of wetter than normal seasons (i.e. El Nino and La Nina in the winter and summer, respectively) ENSO is often not a consistent predictor and moreover, on several occasions the wetter than normal rainfall did not yield above normal seasonal flows. We also examined the seasonal precipitation forecasts for the region from the Climate Forecast System (CFS). The CFS showed reasonable predictive skill for the winter that extends up to four months lead-time. The only CFS skill for forecasting summer rainfall was observed for predicting above normal rainfall in July with one month lead-time. Seasonal forecasts can substantially improve water resources management but currently requires considerations of large uncertainties in the operationally available forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to mathematically describe how fishing (predator exploitation) affects sea urchin abundance (prey) so that predictions about the effects of fishery restrictions on urchin density could be made. This also would indirectly provide forecast of macroalgal forests from barren. In order to obtain such description, a simple model of prey predator dynamics in the presence of predator exploitation was evaluated by using a numerical simulation that parametrically explores the impact of external exploitation in the system equilibrium. The proposed model is consistent with observed alternative states in Mediterranean subtidal rocky bottoms. In fact, the presence of barren in areas both exploited and protected from fishing activity can be explained by hysteresis of the system. Moreover, an irreversible transition was shown to occur when the intrinsic growth rate of the prey decreases (predator restoration through fishing restrictions) suggesting that proper and complex management approaches should be considered to address conservation of a benthic habitat.

During recent years, statistical models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been increasingly applied and evaluated for forecasting of air quality. Methods: The development of ANN and multiple linear regressions (MLRs) has been applied to short-term prediction of the NO2 and NOx concentrations as a function of meteorological conditions. The optimum structure of ANN was determined by a trial and error method. We used hourly NOx and NO2 concentrations and metrological parameters, automatic monitoring network during October and November 2012 for two monitoring sites (Abrasan and Farmandari sites) in Tabriz, Iran. Results: Designing of the network architecture is based on the approximation theory of Kolmogorov, and the structure of ANN with 30 neurons had the best performance. ANN trained by scaled-conjugate-gradient (trainscg) training algorithm has implemented to model. It also demonstrates that MLP neural networks offer several advantages over linear MLR models. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R-2) values are 0.92 and 0/94 for NO2 and NOx concentrations, respectively. But in MLR model, R-2 values were 0.41 and 0.44 for NO2 and NOx concentrations, respectively. Conclusions: This work shows that MLP neural networks can accurately model the relationship between local meteorological data and NO2 and NOx concentrations in an urban environment compared to linear models.",,,,,,,,,,11,11,1,1,,,,,2192-1709,,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

In regions with intensively managed arable soils, the soil P content has been dramatically increased by overfertilization with significant P leaching losses as a result. As a Consequence, in order to control the P losses, P fertilization has been legally restricted. In several EU28 countries, the ammonium lactate extraction method (P-AL) is used as a soil test for P fertilizer advice, but sometimes also to determine the allowed P fertilizer dose to reduce leaching losses. We hypothesize that P-AL as an estimator of soil P capacity should be combined with 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable P (P-CaCl2) and/or hot water extractable P (HWP), both estimators of the soil P intensity, to predict P leaching losses in soils with a high P load. Six long term field trials with a high P load (P-AL: 123 to 375 mg P kg(-1)) on silt loam soils With a specific history of organic and inorganic fertilizer application were sampled for soil analysis and to conduct leaching experiments in the laboratory. P concentrations in the leachates served as a proxy for P leaching. Five field trials were used for model calibration and a sixth one for model validation. Two models, either with P-CaCl2 or with HWP as independent variables, have proven to be stilted to distinguish soils with low and high risk for P leaching. In the range of P-AL in this study, P-AL proved to be a non-significant factor and was therefore not retained in either of the models. We conclude that for soils with large soil P stocks (high P-AL concentrations), both P-CaCl2 and HWP are suitable to detect the ones with a higher risk of P leaching losses. We suggest a threshold value for P-CaCl2 and HWP to be used in combination with P-AL, to select those soils where further P fertilization restrictions or other measures to reduce P leaching losses are needed most urgently. This threshold value however depends on what is considered as an acceptable P concentration in the leaching water of the tillage layer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There has been a clear reduction in trout range in the past 150 years, coinciding with a generalized warming. We show that current trout distribution can be accurately predicted based on historical records and past and present values of three air temperature variables.

The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this fishery relevant scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.",,,,"Tommasi, Desiree/M-1668-2015; Pegion, Kathy V/E-1525-2013; Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008","Tommasi, Desiree/0000-0003-4027-6047; Pegion, Kathy V/0000-0001-5820-7678; Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X",National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA) Special Early-Stage Experimental or Developmental grant; NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric ResearchNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Science and Technology,"We thank S.

Insect outbreaks are a significant forest disturbance that alters forest structure as well as the distribution and connectivity of combustible fuels at broad spatial scales. The effect of insect outbreaks on fire activity is an important but contentious issue with significant policy consequences. The eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is a native defoliating insect in eastern North America whose periodic outbreaks create large patches of dead fir and spruce trees. Of particular concern to fire and forest managers is whether these patches represent an increased fire risk, if so, for how long, and how the relationship between defoliation and fire risk varies through space and time. Previous work suggests a temporary increase in flammability in budworm-killed forests, but regional and seasonal variability in these relationships has not been examined. Using an extensive database on historical lightning-caused fire ignitions and spruce budworm defoliation between 1963 and 2000, we assess the relative importance of cumulative defoliation and fire weather on the probability of ignition in Ontario, Canada. We modeled fire ignition using a generalized additive logistic regression model that accounts for temporal autocorrelation in fire weather. We compared two ecoregions in eastern Ontario (Abitibi Plains) and western Ontario (Lake of the Woods) that differ in terms of climate, geomorphology, and forest composition. We found that defoliation has the potential to both increase and decrease the probability of ignition depending on the time scale, ecoregion, and season examined. Most importantly, we found that lagged spruce budworm defoliation (8-10yr) increases the risk of fire ignition whereas recent defoliation (1yr) can decrease this risk. We also found that historical defoliation has a greater influence on ignition risk during the spring than during the summer fire season. Given predicted increases in forest insect activity due to global change, these results represent important information for fire management agencies that can be used to refine existing models of fire risk.",,,,,,FRQNT New Researcher grant [171961],"We thank the OMNR Aviation Forest Fire and Emergency Services for providing access to the fire, weather, and lightning data.

They are also the starting point of range shifts that result from climate change, through a process involving colonization of newly suitable sites at the cool margin of species distributions. Hence, understanding the processes that drive demography and distribution at high-latitude populations is essential to forecast the response of species to global changes. We investigated the relative importance of solar irradiance (as a proxy for microclimate), habitat quality, and connectivity on occupancy, abundance, and population stability at the northern range margin of the Oberthur's grizzled skipper butterfly Pyrgus armoricanus. For this purpose, butterfly abundance was surveyed in a habitat network consisting of 50 habitat patches over 12 years. We found that occupancy and abundance (average and variability) were mostly influenced by the density of host plants and the spatial isolation of patches, while solar irradiance and grazing frequency had only an effect on patch occupancy. Knowing that the distribution of host plants extends further north, we hypothesize that the actual variable limiting the northern distribution of P. armoricanus might be its dispersal capacity that prevents it from reaching more northern habitat patches. The persistence of this metapopulation in the face of global changes will thus be fundamentally linked to the maintenance of an efficient network of habitats.",,,,"Fourcade, Yoan/H-7253-2012; Ockinger, Erik/F-4154-2010","Fourcade, Yoan/0000-0003-3820-946X; Ockinger, Erik/0000-0001-7517-4505",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [621-2010-5589]; Signhild Engkvist Foundation; Lunds Djurskyddsfond; Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry; Department of Ecology SLU,"Swedish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 621-2010-5589; Signhild Engkvist Foundation; Lunds Djurskyddsfond; Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry; Department of Ecology SLU",,,8,9,0,22,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, a frequent limitation is the inability to validate results. Here, we aim to assess the reliability of CSD for forecasting species occurrence in response to national forest management projections (representing 160,366 km(2)) by comparison against forecasts from a model based on systematically collected colonization-extinction data. We fitted species distribution models using citizen science observations of an old-forest indicator fungus Phellinus ferrugineofuscus. We applied five modeling approaches (generalized linear model, Poisson process model, Bayesian occupancy model, and two MaxEnt models). Models were used to forecast changes in occurrence in response to national forest management for 2020-2110. Forecasts of species occurrence from models based on CSD were congruent with forecasts made using the colonization-extinction model based on systematically collected data, although different modeling methods indicated different levels of change. All models projected increased occurrence in set-aside forest from 2020 to 2110: the projected increase varied between 125% and 195% among models based on CSD, in comparison with an increase of 129% according to the colonization-extinction model. All but one model based on CSD projected a decline in production forest, which varied between 11% and 49%, compared to a decline of 41% using the colonization-extinction model. All models thus highlighted the importance of protected old forest for P. ferrugineofuscus persistence. We conclude that models based on CSD can reproduce forecasts from models based on systematically collected colonization-extinction data and so lead to the same forest management conclusions.

In order to accurately predict the death toll in coal mine caused by environmental pollution, and take effective preventive measures to reduce casualties, in this paper, the grey GM (1, n) forecast model, Markov Theory and metabolic thought are combined. With the calculation of weight of grey Markov model by order relation analysis method, the predictive model is constructed, and a method which is suitable for predicting the death toll of environmental pollution in coal mineis proposed. Based on the death toll of coal mine traffic accidents from 2001 to 2013, the above model is used to predict the death toll of coal mine environmental pollution in 2014, and the result is compared with the actual data. The result shows that the relative error of the prediction on the death cuased by environmental pollution in China's coal mine based on metabolism-GM (1, n) Markov model is 32.73% less than that of grey GM (1, n) prediction model. It can be seen that the proposed grey Markov model has high prediction accuracy and meets the actual demand.

Local adaptation is common in species that span a range of environmental gradients (e.g., soils and climate). Moreover, common garden studies have demonstrated a covariance between neutral markers and functional traits associated with a species' ability to adapt to environmental change. We therefore predicted that genetically distinct populations would respond differently to climate change, resulting in predicted distributions with little overlap. To test whether genetic information improves our ability to predict a species' niche space, we created genetically informed ecological niche models (gENMs) using Populus fremontii (Salicaceae), a widespread tree species in which prior common garden experiments demonstrate strong evidence for local adaptation. Four major findings emerged: (i) gENMs predicted population occurrences with up to 12-fold greater accuracy than models without genetic information; (ii) tests of niche similarity revealed that three ecotypes, identified on the basis of neutral genetic markers and locally adapted populations, are associated with differences in climate; (iii) our forecasts indicate that ongoing climate change will likely shift these ecotypes further apart in geographic space, resulting in greater niche divergence; (iv) ecotypes that currently exhibit the largest geographic distribution and niche breadth appear to be buffered the most from climate change.

At present, technologically comprehensive forecasting estimates are generated using process-based ecological models. However, isolation of the ecological factors that cause uncertainty in model behavior is difficult. To solve this problem, this study aimed to construct a meliorization model evaluation framework to explain uncertainty in model behavior with respect to both the mechanisms and algorithms involved in ecological forecasting based on the principle of landsenses ecology. We introduce a complicated ecological driving mechanism to the process-based ecological model using analytical software and algorithms. Subsequently, as a case study, we apply the meliorizationmodel evaluation framework to detect Eucalyptus biomass forest patches at a regional scale (196,158 ha) using the 3PG2 (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) model. Our results show that this technique improves the accuracy of ecological simulation for ecological forecasting and prevents new uncertainties from being produced by adding a new driving mechanism to the original model structure. This result was supported by our Eucalyptus biomass simulation using the 3PG2 model, in which ecological factors caused 21.83% and 9.05% uncertainty in model behavior temporal and spatial forecasting, respectively. In conclusion, the systematic meliorization model evaluation framework reported here provides a new method that could be applied to research requiring comprehensive ecological forecasting.

Monitoring programs often target areas in which these species aggregate for mating (lek arenas) because of the often cryptic behaviours of these species when away from lek arenas. Due to survey methodologies and the ecology of many lek-mating species, the building of species distribution models (SDMs) requires researchers to consider issues that are generally absent when modelling distributions of non-lek-mating species. We describe these considerations and illustrate the advantages of employing dynamic SDMs to address non-equilibrium between a lek-mating species (Lesser Prairie-Chicken Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) and its environment. LocationNew Mexico, U.S.A. MethodsWe employed a 27-year data set of 2771 lek surveys from a T. pallidicinctus metapopulation to build dynamic SDMs using multi-season occupancy modelling. We considered covariates (1) indexing past abundance and distribution patterns expected to influence dispersal and local persistence, (2) describing landscape and weather dynamics expected to influence local recruitment, and (3) describing survey-level conditions expected to influence lek attendance. ResultsThe most supported dynamic SDM indicated an overall decline in occurrence and an ending distribution more restricted to the northern part of the 1222km(2) study area. Local colonization was best predicted by weather and landscape dynamics, while local extinction was best predicted by population processes and weather. Main conclusionsConservation of T. pallidicinctus will likely face challenges from (1) the reduced likelihood of colonization in areas of historical shrub-targeting herbicide application and (2) projected patterns of seasonal temperature and precipitation under climate change. In considering lek-mating species in general, we recommend the use of dynamic SDMs for an improved understanding of factors influencing distributions through time. Our approach and related efforts represent an important step in forecasting distributions under projected scenarios of environmental change to assist the conservation of these species.",,,,"Sadoti, Giancarlo/A-3138-2011","Sadoti, Giancarlo/0000-0003-3191-8167",UNR Geography Department; UNR College of Science; Nevada Space Grant Consortium; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX13AB65G],"We thank the hundreds of individuals (BLM staff, contractors and volunteers) who surveyed lek arenas in eastern New Mexico over the decades.

Two commonly used, but structurally different, artificial substrates include cylindrical PVC pipes and flat ceramic tiles. Various ecosystem based models extrapolate data from these substrates interchangeably based on the assumption that results are directly comparable. In order to test this assumption we deployed these commonly used artificial substrate materials, PVC poles and ceramic tiles, in shallow patch reefs for 34 months at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef. Tiles were positioned to mimic upwards facing, well-lit substrates (exposed), and downwards facing, shaded (cryptic) substrates. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the community composition differed significantly between all three treatments. The majority of artificial substrate, coral reef experiments focus on key groups of calcifying organisms, primarily: coralline algae, scleractinian coral and/or total calcareous encruster cover. Interestingly, significant differences in the recruitment, colonisation and community composition of these organisms were detected for our three treatments. When compared to ceramic tiles, PVC poles had greater coverage of crustose coralline algae but reduced levels of coral recruits (<1 mm diameter) and turf algae. We suggest that comparisons between studies that utilise data from different substrate types should be used with caution. Additionally, large scale modelling and forecasting exercises utilising these data sets should adjust for the inherent biases of each method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting potential distributions of spreading species is not easy, and forecasting potential distributions with changing climate is even more difficult. Using the globally invasive coypu (Myocastor coypus [Molina, 1782]), we evaluate and compare the utility of a simplistic ecophysiological based model and a correlative model to predict current and future distribution. The ecophysiological model was based on winter temperature relationships with nutria survival. We developed correlative statistical models using the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling and biologically relevant climate data with a global extent. We applied the ecophysiological based model to several global circulation model (GCM) predictions for mid-century. We used global coypu introduction data to evaluate these models and to explore a hypothesized physiological limitation, finding general agreement with known coypu distribution locally and globally and support for an upper thermal tolerance threshold. Global circulation model based model results showed variability in coypu predicted distribution among GCMs, but had general agreement of increasing suitable area in the USA. Our methods highlighted the dynamic nature of the edges of the coypu distribution due to climate non-equilibrium, and uncertainty associated with forecasting future distributions. Areas deemed suitable habitat, especially those on the edge of the current known range, could be used for early detection of the spread of coypu populations for management purposes.

To test such hypothesis, we researched the effects of atmospheric N deposition on N cycling at two Scots pine / European beech mixed forests in Navarre. One forest is placed at 1350 m.a.s.l. and has a continental climate, whereas the other forest is placed at 650 m.a.s.l. and has a wet Mediterranean climate. Preliminary tests indicated that biological N fixation was undetectable, as host plants for symbiotic N fixers were very rare and the activity of free N fixers was undetectable. Therefore, it was assumed that the main input of N in these forests was atmospheric deposition. Hence, we estimated the dependence of ecosystem productivity with the FORECAST ecological model, calibrated for these sites. Six scenarios were simulated with N inputs in the range of 5 to 30 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Our results indicated that forest productivity depends on deposition N inputs, but indicators of N saturation (increased leached N, no additional productivity gains) show that they can become N-saturated when deposition is above 20-25 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), about 5-10 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) above current observed deposition levels.",,,,"Lo, Yueh Hsin/D-2582-2010; Blanco, Juan A./A-4554-2009; Larrainzar, Estibaliz/J-5340-2014; San Emeterio, Leticia/H-4305-2014; de Andres, Ester Gonzalez/AAH-3710-2019","Lo, Yueh Hsin/0000-0001-6444-0273; Blanco, Juan A./0000-0002-6524-4335; Larrainzar, Estibaliz/0000-0002-1254-7391; San Emeterio, Leticia/0000-0002-8063-0402; ",,,,,5,5,0,3,,,,1697-2473,,,ECOSISTEMAS,Ecosistemas,JAN-APR,2017,26,1,,,,,66,78,,10.7818/ECOS.2017.26-1.09,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000407990100009,,,,,

The species' abundance was measured as cover, area and number of colonies. These measures showed the same pattern of variation over the seasonal cycles, with higher values occurring in the warmer seasons. A high percentage of colonies with gonozooids also occurred in the warmer seasons, except in the first year, explaining the reduction in the number and cover of colonies at the beginning of the second year. Atypical salinity conditions in the summer/autumn of the second year may have caused the absence of P. loyola until the spring of the next year.

Biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen (BOD-DO) model is used to show the relationship of the concentration of BOD or DO with the physical characteristic of the river. For this model, it is difficult to determine the analytical solution, so numerical solution of the model is obtained with Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial. With this method, the model is rewritten with differential form, and then the four order differential of the oxygen deficit was expressed with the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial, which had coefficients. Lastly, a simulation test was conducted to verify the rationality of the model. The actual BOD and oxygen deficit values are calculated using the original model.

Simulation results during the calibration and validation periods are evaluated through three statistical indices: Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient, coefficient of determination, and volume difference.

Here, an individual-based model is developed to quantify uncertainty in future trajectories in experimental plots given past observations. Empirical data were used to estimate probabilistic growth, survival, and fission rates of Acropora pulchra and A. intermedia (order Scleractinia) in a sandy reef flat (Bolinao, Philippines). Simulations were initialized with different densities (25 or 50 transplants per species per 16m(2)) to forecast possible coral cover trajectories over a 5-year period. Given current conditions, there is risk of local extinction which is higher in low-density plots for both species, and higher for A. intermedia compared to A. pulchra regardless of density. While total coral cover is projected to increase, species composition in the future is more likely to be highly uneven. The model was used to quantify effect on recovery rate of protection from pulse anthropogenic disturbances, given different initial transplantation densities.

We modelled the effects of bottom-up variables (e.g. land cover) and top-down variables (e.g. fire weather) simultaneously with data aggregated or interpolated to spatial and temporal units of 100 km(2) and 1 yr in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. For models of human-caused fires, we used road density as a surrogate for human access and behaviour. We exploited the additive property of Poisson distributions to estimate cover-type specific fire count rates, which would normally not be possible with data of this spatial resolution. We used piecewise linear functions to model nonlinear relations between fire weather and fire frequency for each cover-type simultaneously. The estimated conditional rates may be considered as expected mean counts per unit area and time. It follows that these rates can be rescaled to arbitrary spatial and temporal extents. Our results showed fire frequency increased nonlinearly as aridity increased and more quickly in disturbed areas than other types. Road density exerted the strongest influence on the frequency of human-caused fires, which were positively correlated with road density.

Marine ecosystems are inherently dynamic, and animal-environment interactions are known to occur over multiple, nested spatial and temporal scales. The spatial resolution and temporal averaging of environmental data layers are therefore key considerations in modelling the environmental determinants of habitat selection. The utility of environmental data contemporaneous to animal presence or movement (e.g. daily, weekly), versus synoptic products (monthly, seasonal, climatological) is currently debated, as are the trade-offs between near real-time, high resolution and composite (i.e. synoptic, cloud-free) data fields. Using movement simulations with built-in environmental preferences in combination with both modelled and remotely-sensed (ROMS, MODIS-Aqua) sea surface temperature (SST) fields, we explore the effects of spatial and temporal resolution (3-111 km, daily-climatological) in predictive habitat models. Results indicate that models fitted using seasonal or climatological data fields can introduce bias in presence-availability designs based upon animal movement datasets, particularly in highly dynamic oceanographic domains. These effects were pronounced where models were constructed using seasonal or climatological fields of coarse (>0.25 degree) spatial resolution. However, cloud obstruction can lead to significant information loss in remotely-sensed data fields. We found that model accuracy decreased substantially above 70% data loss. In cloudy regions, weekly or monthly environmental data fields may therefore be preferable. These findings have important implications for marine resource management, particularly in identifying key habitats for populations of conservation concern, and in forecasting climate-mediated ecosystem changes.",,,,"Scales, Kylie/L-9318-2018","Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956",Cooperative Inst. for Marine Ecosystems and Climate (NOAA SWFSC/UC Santa Cruz),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Roland Langrock in advising HMM development, and participants of a December 2014 workshop at Duke Univ., North Carolina 'Contemporaneous vs climatological variable use in habitat models'.

LocationBoreal forest in central Quebec, eastern Canada. MethodsWe used a dense network of georeferenced historical (similar to 1925) forest plots (n=30033) to document preindustrial forest composition. We evaluated the magnitude of changes with the present-day using modern plots (1980s to 2000s). We reconstructed a long-term, spatially explicit history of logging, spruce budworm outbreaks (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem.], SBO), and fire using historical maps and field surveys. ResultsIn the preindustrial period, late successional coniferous taxa (Abies balsamea and Picea spp.) dominated the landscape, whereas early successional deciduous taxa (Betula spp. and Populus spp.) were confined to recently burned areas. In the present-day landscape, large areas dominated by late successional coniferous taxa have been replaced by early successional deciduous taxa. Forest communities dominated by early successional deciduous taxa increased sharply throughout the study area. Logging has been a minor driver of these changes compared to fire and SBOs. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the importance of documenting the long-term history of both anthropogenic and natural disturbances in order to assess their relative contributions to the development of the present-day forest ecosystems. Natural disturbances have remained the main drivers of forest composition during the 20th century, whereas logging played a less important role.

To date, however, no studies have identified the particular dimensions of realized climatic niches that are spatially and temporally conserved for a whole taxonomic group on a global scale. Understanding realized niche dynamics along each individual climatic variable separately is a key consideration for improving forecasts of invasive species distributions and anticipating future range expansions. LocationGlobal. MethodsUsing 181 successful invasion events for 128 alien herpetofaunal species across the globe, we applied a robust niche dynamics framework and analysed the conservatism of the realized climatic niche and its influencing factors along 19 temperature and precipitation variables. ResultsWe found that the magnitude of the niche expansion along the maximum temperature of the warmest month (or warmest quarter) was, on average, the lowest compared with the niche expansion magnitude along the minimum, average, range and seasonal temperature characteristics and all precipitation variables. Furthermore, the niche shift along the maximum temperature was only negatively correlated with native range size and was unrelated to residence time, species traits, introduction propagule pressure, topographic heterogeneity or equatorwards and polewards range expansion. Main conclusionsWe provide the first evidence that the realized climatic niche of alien herpetofaunal species is generally most conserved along maximum temperatures.

Aggregated and remotely collected 'big data' are required to forecast the effects of global change on plant communities. We synthesize advances in developing and exploiting big data in global change plant ecology, and identify challenges to their effective use in global change studies. Location Global. Methods We explored databases, catalogues and registries with respect to their accessibility, geographical and taxonomic extent, sample bias and other types of uncertainty, from the perspective both users and contributors. We identified four kinds of big data needed to predict the impacts of global change on plant populations and communities using spatially explicit models: remotely sensed and other environmental maps, species occurrence records, community composition (plots) and species traits, especially demographics. Results Digital environmental maps, including remotely sensed data, are the most mature class of big data discussed herein whereby protocols for archiving, discovering and analysing them have developed over three decades. Species locality records are being aggregated into databases that are easy to search and access, and while methods for addressing uncertainties are a major research focus, better spatial representation is still needed. Plot data from inventories have tremendous potential for monitoring and modelling the impacts of global change on plant communities but tend to be restricted to forests or concentrated in certain geographical areas. Ongoing efforts to aggregate plot and trait data from multiple sources are challenged by their heterogeneous coverage, attributes and protocols and a lack of data standards. Main conclusions Future goals include developing systematic frameworks for selecting geospatial data, improving tools for assessing the quality of species occurrence records and increased aggregation and discoverability of plot and trait data.

The current non-native flora of a region may hence contain species that are not yet naturalized but may become so in the future, especially if climate change lifts limitations on species spread. In Europe, non-native garden plants represent a huge pool of potential future invaders. Here, we evaluate the naturalization risk from this species pool and how it may change under a warmer climate. Location Europe. Methods We selected all species naturalized anywhere in the world but not yet in Europe from the set of non-native European garden plants. For this subset of 783 species, we used species distribution models to assess their potential European ranges under different scenarios of climate change. Moreover, we defined geographical hotspots of naturalization risk from those species by combining projections of climatic suitability with maps of the area available for ornamental plant cultivation. Results Under current climate, 165 species would already find suitable conditions in >5% of Europe. Although climate change substantially increases the potential range of many species, there are also some that are predicted to lose climatically suitable area under a changing climate, particularly species native to boreal and Mediterranean biomes. Overall, hotspots of naturalization risk defined by climatic suitability alone, or by a combination of climatic suitability and appropriate land cover, are projected to increase by up to 102% or 64%, respectively. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the risk of naturalization of European garden plants will increase with warming climate, and thus it is very likely that the risk of negative impacts from invasion by these plants will also grow. It is therefore crucial to increase awareness of the possibility of biological invasions among horticulturalists, particularly in the face of a warming climate.",,,,"Weigelt, Patrick/E-2122-2014; Pysek, Petr/B-1957-2012; Pergl, Jan/H-1071-2011; Kreft, Holger/A-4736-2008; Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019","Weigelt, Patrick/0000-0002-2485-3708; Pergl, Jan/0000-0002-0045-1974; Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Dullinger, Iwona/0000-0002-2692-2973; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887","ERA-Net BiodivERsA; FWF (Austrian Science Fund)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 1443-B25]; DFG (German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG); ANR (French National Research Agency)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-EBID-0004]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KL 1866/6-1, KL 1866/9-1]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-36079G, P504/11/1028]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Praemium Academiae award from The Czech Academy of Sciences; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig [DFG FZT 118]","This research was funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA, with the national funders FWF (Austrian Science Fund, I 1443-B25), DFG (German Research Foundation) and ANR (French National Research Agency, ANR-13-EBID-0004), part of the 2012-2013 BiodivERsA call for research proposals.

Due to growing computational power and a diversity of software with different capabilities, simulations are becoming increasingly powerful and useful. However, the widespread use of simulations by geneticists and ecologists is hindered by difficulties in understanding these softwares' complex capabilities, composing code and input files, a daunting bioinformatics barrier and a steep conceptual learning curve. SKELESIM (an R package) guides users in choosing appropriate simulations, setting parameters, calculating genetic summary statistics and organizing data output, in a reproducible pipeline within the R environment. SKELESIM is designed to be an extensible framework that can 'wrap' around any simulation software (inside or outside the R environment) and be extended to calculate and graph any genetic summary statistics. Currently, SKELESIM implements coalescent and forward-time models available in the FASTSIMCOAL2 and RMETASIM simulation engines to produce null distributions for multiple population genetic statistics and marker types, under a variety of demographic conditions. SKELESIM is intended to make simulations easier while still allowing full model complexity to ensure that simulations play a fundamental role in molecular ecology investigations.

Using reduced genomic (SNP) data from three lizard species codistributed in Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest (Anolis punctatus, Anolis ortonii, and Polychrus marmoratus), we first reconstruct former population history and test for assemblage-level responses to cycles of moisture transport recently implicated in changes of forest distribution during the Late Quaternary. We find support for population shifts within the time frame of inferred precipitation fluctuations (the last 250,000 years) but detect idiosyncratic responses across species and uniformity of within-species responses across forest regions. These results are incongruent with expectations of concerted population expansion in response to increased rainfall and fail to detect out-of-phase demographic syndromes (expansions vs. contractions) across forest regions. Using reduced genomic data to infer species-specific demographical parameters, we then model the plausible spatial distribution of genetic diversity in the Atlantic Forest into future climates (2080) under a medium carbon emission trajectory. The models forecast very distinct trajectories for the lizard species, reflecting unique estimated population densities and dispersal abilities. Ecological and demographic constraints seemingly lead to distinct and asynchronous responses to climatic regimes in the tropics, even among similarly distributed taxa.

Here we discuss how this emphasis, and the corresponding lack of methods for extracting information about biotic/intrinsic contributions to patterns of genetic variation, may bias our general understanding of the factors driving genetic structure. Specifically, this emphasis has promoted a tendency to attribute discordant phylogeographic patterns to the idiosyncracies of history, as well as an adherence to generic null expectations of concordance with reduced predictive power. We advocate that it is time for a paradigm shift in comparative phylogeography, especially given the limited utility of the concordance criterion as genomic data provide ever-increasing -levels of resolution. Instead of adhering to the concordance- discordance -dichotomy, comparative phylogeography needs to emphasize the contribution of taxon-specific traits that will determine whether concordance is a meaningful criterion for evaluating hypotheses or may predict discordant phylogeographic structure. Through reference to some case -studies we illustrate how refined hypotheses based on taxon-specifictraits can provide improved predictive frameworks to forecast species responses to climatic change or biogeographic barriers while gaining unique insights about the taxa themselves and their interactions with their environment. We outline a potential avenue toward a synthetic comparative phylogeographic paradigm that includes addressing some important conceptual and methodological challenges related to study design and application of model-based approaches for evaluating support of trait-based hypotheses under the proposed paradigm.",,,,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1118815],"We thank Qixin He, Rob Massatti, and Jeet Sukumaran for helpful discussions, three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments, and the organizers, Francisco Ayala and John Avise, and the participants of the symposium whose work helped motivate our work.

As is shown, a rapid initial divergence of the northern (Yamal Peninsula) and southern (Kurgan oblast) muskrat populations, accompanied by emergence of morphological differences between them, is followed by biocenotic adaptation with gradual (over half a century) directed parallel changes in the mandible shape associated with its functional properties in the south and north of the region. The range of morphogenetic transformations of the allochronic samples of the northern group is larger as compared with the southern group, which is explainable by the more severe environmental conditions in the Yamal forest-tundra. Both populations display a statistically significant decrease in the morphological disparity of the mandible shape from the mid-20th century to its end. Leveling of the muskrat mandible size between the northern and southern populations by the end of the last century excludes any allometric effects in the observed geographic and chronographic differences in the mandible shape. Therefore, microevolutionary transformations of the morphogenesis of other invasive species can be implemented on a historical time scale, that is, relatively rapidly. This should be taken into account when forecasting potential local biocenotic crises. The model of the long-term morphogenetic aftereffects of the muskrat introduction in Western Siberia confirms the possibility of rapid adaptive morphogenetic, morphological, and functional changes in invasive mammalian species introduced into new communities.",,,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [16-04-01831a]; program ""Living Nature"" of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences [15-12-4-25]","We thank Yu.

Now two space vehicles of this series - Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 work at their orbits. Landsat 7 is close to exhaustion of a technical resource therefore the main source of urgent imagery is the Landsat 8 satellite. The satellite images received from the Landsat 8 are widely used for the solution of the scientific and practical tasks related to operational control of natural resources, a research of dynamics of natural processes and the phenomena, the analysis of the reasons, forecasting of possible consequences and the choice of ways of the prevention of emergency situations. In comparison with the previous devices of a series the spectral range of the Landsat 8 equipment is expanded at the expense of two new channels which allows to carry out studying of water objects and aerosols. Various combinations of channels of visible and near infrared radiation are used for the solution of a large number of thematic tasks: classification and analysis of a condition of a vegetable cover; studying of farmlands, wetlands; analysis of a condition of water objects; classification of changes in forests; mapping of economic and biometric characteristics of forest plantings; definition of stocks of tree species; mapping of soils; studying of dynamics of the fires and post-fire analysis of the territory. Combination of various channels of the Landsat 8 satellite for research depends on conditions of a concrete scene (the area, a shooting season etc.).

The forecast of arsenic mobility is critical in assessing the risk for soils contaminated with arsenic compounds. Reliable ecological predictions can be made only on the basis of exact knowledge of the processes occurring with pollutants in the natural environment. The study of sorption processes of arsenic ions by the soil cover of the Udmurt Republic is an actual problem that will allow carrying out measures to prevent spread of pollutants in natural areas. Adsorption of arsenite-ion by sod-strongly podzolic, sod-carbonate and gray forest soils was carried out under static conditions. The number of absorbed ions was found from the difference between the initial and equilibrium concentrations, which were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The experimentally obtained adsorption isotherms were explained using Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. According to the Langmuir equation, sod-carbonate soil has the greatest sorption capacity with respect to arseniteion (1.667 mmol/kg), then in descending order follows gray forest soil (0.952 mmol/kg), and, finally, sod-strongly podzolic soil (0.784 mmol/kg). However, the strength of the resulting bonds in sod-carbonate soil (11.25 dm3/mmol) is small in comparison with sod-podzolic soil (71.25 dm3/mmol). Gray forest soil with a slight advantage in sorption capacity is considerably inferior to sod-strongly podzolic soil in the retention force of arsenite-ion (14.25 dm3/mmol). To study the mechanism of the adsorption process, we examined the equilibrium data using the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model. The calculated values of the free energy of adsorption for all soil samples under study are less than 8 kJ/mol, which indicates the physical nature of interaction of the adsorbate with the adsorbent. Weak fixation of arsenic ions by soil causes its high mobility. The values of interaction energy of adsorbed arsenite-ions with soil, calculated by the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation, are insignificant. The maximum energy of 3.67 kJ/mol was recorded for sod-podzolic soils and the minimum energy of 2.28 kJ/mol was found for sod-carbonate soil, gray forest soil occupies the middle position (3.04 kJ/mol). Thus, it is necessary to take into account the high mobility of arsenite-ions in natural environments in organization of environmental monitoring of especially dangerous objects using arsenic compounds in the production cycle.",,,,,,,,,,1,2,0,0,,,,1995-4301,2618-8406,,THEOR APPL ECOL,Theor.

However, Mexico's vulnerability to climate change impacts is a major motivating factor behind its announced intended contributions at COP21 to cut its baseline emissions by at least 25% in 2030. We analyze the macroeconomic impacts of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) process undertaken in the Mexican border state of Baja California (BC). We adapt a state-of-the-art regional macroeconometric model to analyze the BC economy-wide impacts of 22 GHG mitigation policy options recommended in the Baja California CAP. The combined effects include an average annual increase of 1680 new jobs (or about 0.11% of the average annual employment in the baseline economic forecast) and a Gross State Product (GSP) increase of $9.85 billion pesos in NPV over the 2015-2030 planning horizon. Although the main objective of GHG mitigation is to reduce atmospheric concentrations, and hence future potential damages of these pollutants, the stimulus to the BC economy from the implementation of its CAP represents a valuable co-benefit. Moreover, it is a tangible one that will take place in the near-term, in contrast to the more long-term and more uncertain benefits associated with reducing climate change damages.

As a result, scientists are now engaged in making predictions about an uncertain future, which entails the efficient communication of this uncertainty. Here we show the benefits of hierarchically decomposing the uncertainty in predicted changes in animal population size into its components due to structural uncertainty in climate scenarios (greenhouse gas emissions and global circulation models), structural uncertainty in the demographic model, climatic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity unexplained by climate-demographic trait relationships, and sampling variance in demographic parameter estimates. We quantify components of uncertainty surrounding the future abundance of a migratory bird, the greater snow goose (Chen caeruslescens atlantica), using a process-based demographic model covering their full annual cycle. Our model predicts a slow population increase but with a large prediction uncertainty. As expected from theoretical variance decomposition rules, the contribution of sampling variance to prediction uncertainty rapidly overcomes that of process variance and dominates. Among the sources of process variance, uncertainty in the climate scenarios contributed less than 3% of the total prediction variance over a 40-year period, much less than environmental stochasticity. Our study exemplifies opportunities to improve the forecasting of complex systems using long-term studies and the challenges inherent to predicting the future of stochastic systems.",,,,"PERON, Guillaume/C-5379-2013","PERON, Guillaume/0000-0002-6311-4377",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Network of centres of excellence ArcticNet; Canadian Wildlife Service,"This work was funded by grants from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Network of centres of excellence ArcticNet and the Canadian Wildlife Service to G.G.",,,4,4,0,36,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The refinement of BGC models through the assimilation of variables calculated from observed in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs), such as phytoplankton absorption, is problematic. Empirically derived relationships between IOPs and variables such as chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl a), total suspended solids (TSS) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been shown to have errors that can exceed 100% of the observed quantity. These errors are greatest in shallow coastal regions, such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), due to the additional signal from bottom reflectance. Rather than assimilate quantities calculated using IOP algorithms, this study demonstrates the advantages of assimilating quantities calculated directly from the less error-prone satellite remote-sensing reflectance (RSR). To assimilate the observed RSR, we use an in-water optical model to produce an equivalent simulated RSR and calculate the mismatch between the observed and simulated quantities to constrain the BGC model with a deterministic ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF). The traditional assumption that simulated surface Chl a is equivalent to the remotely sensed OC3M estimate of Chl a resulted in a forecast error of approximately 75 %. We show this error can be halved by instead using simulated RSR to constrain the model via the assimilation system. When the analysis and forecast fields from the RSR-based assimilation system are compared with the non-assimilating model, a comparison against independent in situ observations of Chl a, TSS and dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO3, NH4 and DIP) showed that errors are reduced by up to 90 %. In all cases, the assimilation system improves the simulation compared to the non-assimilating model. Our approach allows for the incorporation of vast quantities of remote-sensing observations that have in the past been discarded due to shallow water and/or artefacts introduced by terrestrially derived TSS and CDOM or the lack of a calibrated regional IOP algorithm.",,,,"Lovell, Jennifer/B-4604-2011; King, Edward/A-1473-2012; skerratt, jennifer/N-4313-2019; matear, richard J/C-5133-2011; Jones, Emlyn/D-4525-2011; Skerratt, Jennifer H/F-2010-2015; Wild-Allen, Karen/D-9263-2018; Baird, Mark/D-7172-2015; Robson, Barbara/B-8296-2008","Lovell, Jennifer/0000-0003-0182-2797; King, Edward/0000-0002-6898-2130; skerratt, jennifer/0000-0001-9023-4692; matear, richard J/0000-0002-3225-0800; Jones, Emlyn/0000-0002-7636-288X; Skerratt, Jennifer H/0000-0001-9023-4692; Baird, Mark/0000-0003-4955-2298; Robson, Barbara/0000-0002-1811-3527; Margvelashvili, Nugzar/0000-0003-2045-9946",CSIRO Wealth from Oceans FlagshipCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Gas Industry Social & Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA); CSIRO Coastal Carbon Cluster; CSS FSP,"We would firstly like to acknowledge the thorough and insightful comments provided by the three reviewers: Emmanuel Boss, Stefano Ciavatta and David Ford.

Small-scale investigations provide compelling evidence of specific effects of global change on local systems, but are of limited use in modeling complex ecological processes at continental-to-global scales. Long-term observations distributed across a diversity of habitat types are needed to improve the ability to forecast ecological change at large spatial and temporal scales. This special issue introduces the Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a long-term, continental-scale ecological research platform designed to deliver these large-scale datasets. The TOS measures biodiversity of key biota (soil microbes, insects, plants, small mammals), ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry, infectious disease dynamics, phenology, and population dynamics. The articles in this special issue describe the scientific rationale for the sampling designs of the TOS, including an overview of protocols, locations, and frequencies of measurements. The science designs are a culmination of design requirements scoped by NEON and the National Science Foundation, best available practices put forth by the scientific community, input from technical working groups, and consideration of logistical and financial constraints by NEON staff. Within each site, measurements have been collocated to the extent possible to optimize linkages among different sampling elements. Integrated analyses of terrestrial observations with sensor-based, imagery, and remote-sensing data collected by other NEON subsystems can facilitate scaling of measured parameters to larger spatial and temporal scales. NEON is designed to collect data for 30 years, and make these data freely available on a public data portal (data.neonscience.org). Samples and specimens will be archived and available to the scientific community upon request.

Our primary objective was to forecast impacts from an imminent biological invasion (laurel wilt disease) by quantifying resources provided by native (threatened) and exotic fruits (disease-resistant) and associated bird foraging preferences. Methods In the southeastern USA, we tested for redundancy among the resources provided by native and exotic fruits to overwintering birds. Comparisons between abundant subcanopy species Persea borbonia (native) and Cinnamomum camphora (exotic) were paramount considering the widespread disease-induced decline of P. borbonia, and the biological and phylogenetic similarities between these species. Across two winter survey periods, we quantified fruit removal and documented bird species using motion-activated cameras in the field. Physical and chemical fruit characteristics were also quantified. Important Findings Foraging bouts on both P. borbonia and C. camphora fruits were documented for four native bird species. There was no difference in selectivity between fruit types during Year 1 of our survey, but there was a significant preference for C. camphora fruit in Year 2; the change in preference was correlated with significantly lower temperatures in Year 2. While the pulp/seed ratio and moisture content differed, the nutritional content of fruit pulp (g/100 g) was similar between fruit types. Given the apparent redundancy among these native and exotic fruit resources, we forecast increases in the consumption and dispersal of exotic propagules following the widespread laurel wilt disease-induced decline of P. borbonia and other native fruit bearing members of Lauraceae. This empirically based prediction is among the first to document exotic forest pathogens as indirect threats to native birdplant interactions and potential facilitators of exotic plant invasion.",,,,,,"Estuarine Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA11NOS4200080]","This research was conducted in the National Estuarine Reserve System under an award from the Estuarine Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Award #NA11NOS4200080).",,,3,4,1,24,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

The attraction of natural enemies towards herbivore-induced plant volatiles is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the majority of published studies are carried under optimal water and nutrient regimes and with just one herbivore. But what happens when additional levels of ecological complexity are added? Does the presence of a second herbivore, microorganisms, and abiotic stress interfere with plant-natural enemy communication? or is communication stable enough to withstand disruption by additional biotic and abiotic factors? 2. Investigating the effects of these additional levels of ecological complexity is key to understanding the stability of tritrophic interactions in natural ecosystems and may aid to forecast the impact of environmental disturbances on these, especially in climate change scenarios, which are often associated with modifications in plant and arthropod species distribution and increased levels of abiotic stress. 3. This review explores the literature on natural enemy attraction to herbivore-induced volatiles when, besides herbivory, plants are challenged by additional biotic and abiotic factors. 4. The aim of this review was to establish the impact of different biotic and abiotic factors on plant-natural enemy communication and to highlight critical aspects to guide future research efforts.",,,,,,,,,,12,12,2,49,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Considering both in situ and ex situ populations provides an integrated approach to the preservation of a species' evolutionary potential. The joint use of molecular and environmental analyses allows conservation schemes to be implemented when reintroducing captive populations, and wild populations to be prioritized for conservation purposes. We used genetic data and environmental analyses to select candidate areas for the reintroduction of a captive population of the Mexican prairie dog, Cynomys mexicanus, and prioritize wild populations for the conservation of this endangered endemic species. We estimated the levels of genetic diversity and differentiation of the captive population and compared them with those of six wild populations. We used species distribution modeling (SDM) to perform forecasts under future climate change scenarios and identify areas with suitable environmental conditions for the populations to persist in the medium to long term. The captive population showed high levels of genetic diversity (H-d = 0.692, H-E = 0.52), but was genetically differentiated from the wild populations. The genetic structure of wild populations should therefore be considered when reintroducing captive Mexican prairie dogs. In the wild populations, we found a correlation between colony area and nuclear genetic diversity, suggesting that genetic drift and/or inbreeding have been stronger in smaller colonies. The occupied climate space was well differentiated among wild colonies. The impact of agriculture and roads was stronger in the northeastern area of the species range, where SDM forecasts suggest that environmental conditions may remain suitable in the future. Finally, we identified three colonies as conservation priorities based on both genetic and ecological criteria. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among all aspects of invasion biology, biotic interactions between invaders and native species are of particular importance. They strongly influence the invasion velocity as well as species responses to climate-induced stressors. Yet the effects of biotic interactions and other important demographic processes remain overlooked among most studies of climate-mediated invasions. We critically assessed current modelling techniques for forecasting marine invasions under climate change, with a particular focus on their ability to account for important biotic interactions and demographic processes. We show that coupled range dynamics models currently represent the most comprehensive and promising approach for modelling and managing marine invasions under climate change. We show, using the crown-of-thorns seastar (Acanthaster planci), why model architectures that account for biotic interactions and demographic and spatial processes (and their interaction) are required to provide ecologically realistic predictions of the distribution and abundance of invader species, both under present-day conditions and into the future. We suggest potential solutions to inform data-poor situations, such as Bayesian parameter estimation and meta-analysis, and identify strategic and targeted gaps in marine invasion research.

These might survive by tracking those shifts, however successful responses will depend on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats (current and future) and on their connectivity. Most herptiles (i.e., amphibians and reptiles) have low dispersal abilities, and therefore herptiles are among the most vulnerable groups to environmental changes. Here we assessed the vulnerability of herptile species to future climate and land use changes in fragmented landscapes. We developed and tested a methodological approach combining the strengths of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and of functional connectivity analysis. First, using SDMs we forecasted current and future distributions of potential suitable areas as well as range dynamics for four herptile species in Portugal. SDM forecasts for 2050 were obtained under two contrasting emission scenarios, translated into moderate (low-emissions scenario) or large (high-emissions scenario) changes in climate and land use conditions. Then, we calculated and analysed functional connectivity from areas projected to lose environmental suitability towards areas keeping suitable conditions. Landscape matrix resistance and barrier effects of the national motorway network were incorporated as the main sources of fragmentation. Potential suitable area was projected to decrease under future conditions for most test species, with the high-emissions scenario amplifying the losses or gains. Spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity between potentially suitable areas signalled the most important locations for maintaining linkages and migration corridors, as well as potential conflicts due to overlaps with the current motorway network. By integrating SDM projections with functional connectivity analysis, we were able to assess and map the vulnerability of distinct herptile species to isolation or extinction under environmental change scenarios. Our framework provides valuable information, with fairly low data requirements, for optimizing biodiversity management and mitigation efforts, aiming to reduce the complex and often synergistic negative impacts of multiple environmental change drivers. Implications for conservation planning and management are discussed from a global change adaptation perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.",,,,"Hattab, Tarek/K-2992-2014; Le Loc'h, Francois/A-5038-2008","Hattab, Tarek/0000-0002-1420-5758; Le Loc'h, Francois/0000-0002-3372-6997","Inst. de Recherche pour le D'eveloppement (IRD, France); Total Foundation (CHARMMED Project)","Funding received from Inst. de Recherche pour le D'eveloppement (IRD, France) and Total Foundation (CHARMMED Project).",,,5,5,3,51,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2016,39,12,,,,,1227,1237,,10.1111/ecog.01937,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000389304800009,,,,,

Forest landscape restoration will require scaling up ecological knowledge of secondary succession from small-scale field studies to predict forest recovery rates in heterogeneous landscapes. However, ecological field studies reveal widely divergent times to forest recovery, in part due to landscape features that are difficult to replicate in empirical studies. Seed rain can determine reforestation rate and depends on landscape features that are beyond the scale of most field studies. We develop mathematical models to quantify how landscape configuration affects seed rain and forest regrowth in degraded patches. The models show how landscape features can alter the successional trajectories of otherwise identical patches, thus providing insight into why some empirical studies reveal a strong effect of seed rain on secondary succession, while others do not. We show that seed rain will strongly limit reforestation rate when patches are near a threshold for arrested succession, when positive feedbacks between tree canopy cover and seed rain occur during early succession, and when directed dispersal leads to between-patch interactions. In contrast, seed rain has weak effects on reforestation rate over a wide range of conditions, including when landscape-scale seed availability is either very high or very low. Our modeling framework incorporates growth and survival parameters that are commonly estimated in field studies of reforestation. We demonstrate how mathematical models can inform forest landscape restoration by allowing land managers to predict where natural regeneration will be sufficient to restore tree cover. Translating quantitative forecasts into spatially targeted interventions for forest landscape restoration could support target goals of restoring millions of hectares of degraded land and help mitigate global climate change.",,,,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1415297],"T.

Because plants largely determine the structure and function of coastal marshes, quantifying plant biomass is essential for evaluating these ecosystem services, understanding the biogeochemical processes that regulate ecosystem function, and forecasting tidal wetland responses to accelerated sea level rise. Allometry is a convenient and efficient technique for nondestructive estimation of plant biomass, and it is commonly used in studies of carbon and nitrogen cycles, energy flows, and marsh surface elevation change. We present plant allometry data and models developed for three long-term experiments at the Smithsonian Global Change Research Wetland, a brackish marsh in the Rhode River subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay. The dataset contains 9,771 measurements of stem height, dry mass, and (in 9638 cases) stem width across 11 plant species. The vast majority of observations are for Schoenoplectus americanus (8430) and Phragmites australis (311), with fewer observations for other common species: Amaranthus cannabinus, Atriplex patula, Iva frutescens, Kosteletzkya virginica, Polygonum hydropiper, Solidago sempervirens, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina cynosuroides, and Typha angustifolia. Allometric relationships take the form of linear regressions of biomass (transformed using the Box-Cox procedure) on either stem height and width, or on stem height alone. Allometric relationships for Schoenoplectus americanus were not meaningfully altered by elevated CO2, N enrichment, the community context, interannual variation in climate, or year, showing that a single equation can be used across a broad range of conditions for this species. Archived files include: (1) raw data used to derive allometric equations for each species, (2) reports and evaluations of the allometric equations we derived from the data, and (3) R code with which our derivations can be replicated. Methodological details of our experiments, data collection efforts, and statistical modeling are described in the metadata.

In the winter moth Operophtera brumata timing of egg-hatching has severe fitness consequences on growth and reproduction as egg-hatching has to match bud burst of the host tree. In the winter moth, as in many insect species, egg development is strongly affected by ambient temperatures. Here we use laboratory experiments to show for the first time that the effect of temperature on developmental rate depends on the stage of development of the eggs. Building on this experimental finding, we present a novel physiological model to describe winter moth egg development in response to temperature. Our model, a modification of the existing Sharpe-Schoolfield biophysical model, incorporates the effect of developmental stage on developmental rate. Next we validate this model using a 13-year data-set from winter moth eggs kept under ambient conditions and compared this validation with a degree day model and with the Sharpe-Schoolfield model, which lacks the interaction between temperature and developmental stage on developmental rate. We show that accounting for the interaction between temperature and developmental stage improved the predictive power of the model and contributed to our understanding of annual variation in winter moth egg phenology. As climate change leads to unequal changes in temperatures throughout the year, a description of insect development in response to realistic patterns of temperature rather than an invariable degree-day approach will help us to better predict future responses of insect phenology, and thereby insect fitness, to climate change.",,,,"Visser, Marcel E/A-9151-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Visser, Marcel E/0000-0002-1456-1939; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Salis, Lucia/0000-0002-6919-2827",NWO-VICI grantNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),The project was supported by a NWO-VICI grant to MEV.,,,10,10,2,43,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2016,125,12,,,,,1772,1781,,10.1111/oik.03257,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000389308400009,,,,,

A common approach to address this question is through models that project current population state using the functional relationship between demographic rates and climatic variables. We argue that this approach can lead to erroneous conclusions when interpopulation dispersal is not considered. We found that immigration can release the population from climate-driven trajectories even when local vital rates are climate dependent. We illustrated this using individual-based data on a trans-equatorial migratory seabird, the Scopoli's shearwater Calonectris diomedea, in which the variation of vital rates has been associated with large-scale climatic indices. We compared the population annual growth rate (i), estimated using local climate-driven parameters with (i), a population growth rate directly estimated from individual information and that accounts for immigration. While (i) varied as a function of climatic variables, reflecting the climate-dependent parameters, (i) did not, indicating that dispersal decouples the relationship between population growth and climate variables from that between climatic variables and vital rates. Our results suggest caution when assessing demographic effects of climatic variability especially in open populations for very mobile organisms such as fish, marine mammals, bats, or birds.

However, forecasts of how these interactions affect biodiversity across landscapes are challenging ( and lacking) because the outcome of interactions depends not only on the identity of the interacting species but also on local environmental conditions. Thus, we study how biotic interactions manifest across a landscape. Location High-latitude northern Finland and Norway ( 69 degrees N, 21 degrees E). Methods We modelled the influence of a dominant shrub, Empetrum hermaphroditum, on spatial patterns of species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens ( using cover of the shrub as a proxy for the frequency and intensity of interaction with other species) across a topographically variable landscape. Results The relationship between the cover of the dominant shrub and species richness differed between guilds, being strongest for vascular plant richness, and varied considerably along environmental gradients. The dominant shrub showed stronger negative impact on vascular plant richness under less abiotically extreme conditions. For lichens, the relationship was the opposite: under mild conditions, species richness increased with the cover of the shrub. Incorporating specific leaf area ( SLA) data into analyses revealed that the dominant shrub affected species with high SLA ( typically competitive species of resource-rich environments) most negatively. Main conclusions Our findings show how the impact of a dominant species varies across a landscape, with distinctly different effects on competitive and stress-tolerant vascular plants, and on bryophytes and lichens. Spatial predictions of biodiversity trends under global environmental change could, therefore, critically benefit from accounting for context-dependent impacts of biotic interactions.",,,,"le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011; Heikkinen, Risto K./AAN-6257-2020","le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Heikkinen, Risto K./0000-0003-4190-5108; Mod, Heidi/0000-0001-7800-2688; Wisz, Mary S./0000-0002-5357-6367; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [1140873, 286950]","We acknowledge funding from the Academy of Finland (Project Number 1140873).

In the northern Wadden Sea, seagrass beds have expanded and become denser, while in the southern Wadden Sea, only small beds with low shoot densities are found. A lack of documentation of historical distributions hampers conservation management. Yet, the recovery in the northern Wadden Sea provides opportunity to construct robust habitat suitability models to support management. We tuned habitat distribution models based on 17years of seagrass surveys in the northern Wadden Sea and high-resolution hydrodynamics and geomorphology for the entire Wadden Sea using five machine learning approaches. To obtain geographically transferable models, hyperparameters were tuned on the basis of prediction accuracy assessed by non-random, spatial cross-validation. The spatial cross-validation methodology was combined with a consensus modelling approach. The predicted suitability scores correlated amongst each other and with the hold-out observations in the training area indicating that the models converged and were transferable across space. Prediction accuracy was improved by averaging the predictions of the best models. We graphically examined the relationship between the consensus suitability score and independent presence-only data from outside the training area using the area-adjusted seagrass frequency per suitability class (continuous Boyce index). The Boyce index was positively correlated with the suitability score indicating the adequacy of the prediction methodology. We used the plot of the continuous Boyce index against habitat suitability score to demarcate three habitat classes - unsuitable, marginal and suitable - for the entire international Wadden Sea. This information is valuable for habitat conservation and restoration management. Divergence between predicted suitability and actual distributions from the recent past indicates that unaccounted factors limit seagrass development in the southern Wadden Sea.Synthesis and applications. Our methodology and data enabled us to produce a robust and validated consensus habitat suitability model. We identified highly suitable areas where intertidal seagrass meadows may establish and persist.

Remote sensing (RS) provides a wide-range of satellite-based environmental variables that can be fed into species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate species-environment relations and forecast responses to change. We address the spatiotemporal dynamics of species' habitat suitability at the landscape level by combining multi-temporal RS data with SDMs for analysing inter-annual habitat suitability dynamics. We implemented this framework with a vulnerable plant species (Veronica micrantha), by combining SDMs with a time-series of RS-based metrics of vegetation functioning related to primary productivity, seasonality, phenology and actual evapotranspiration. Besides RS variables, predictors related to landscape structure, soils and wildfires were ranked and combined through multi-model inference (MMI). To assess recent dynamics, a habitat suitability time-series was generated through model hindcasting. MMI highlighted the strong predictive ability of RS variables related to primary productivity and water availability for explaining the test-species distribution, along with soil, wildfire regime and landscape composition. The habitat suitability time-series revealed the effects of short-term land cover changes and inter-annual variability in climatic conditions. Multi-temporal SDMs further improved predictions, benefiting from RS time-series. Overall, results emphasize the integration of landscape attributes related to function, composition and spatial configuration for improving the explanation of ecological patterns. Moreover, coupling SDMs with RS functional metrics may provide early-warnings of future environmental changes potentially impacting habitat suitability.

Stream consumers obtain most of their energy from leaf litter provided by the terrestrial vegetation. Thus, understanding the relationship between riparian vegetation, aquatic communities and litter decomposition may help explaining the variability in aquatic communities and processes among non-impacted streams, and anticipate their responses to anthropogenic-induced changes in the riparian vegetation. We surveyed 10 small non-impacted forest streams in central Portugal for riparian vegetation (species richness), benthic litter (species richness and biomass), aquatic hyphomycete conidia in transport (species richness and conidia concentration) and macroinvertebrates associated with benthic litter (taxon richness, density and biomass), during the litter fall peak. We found significant correlations between (a) aquatic communities and riparian vegetation species richness, (b) aquatic communities and benthic litter species richness and biomass and (c) within aquatic communities. Oak litter decomposition rates (from a previous experiment on the same streams) were also correlated with riparian tree species richness. This survey showed that spatial variability in riparian vegetation, benthic litter, aquatic communities and litter decomposition can be high even within a relatively small area, and allowed the identification of complex interactions between these components of the aquatic detrital food web. The positive correlation between aquatic hyphomycete species richness, macroinvertebrate taxon richness, litter decomposition and riparian tree species richness suggests that anthropogenic-induced decreases in riparian species richness may affect aquatic communities and processes.

The analysis was performed using presence-only data for 14 Heteroptera and Odonata species. Current and future models were developed to identify areas where the climate would be suitable for small ponds, using Maxent v3.3.3k, with future models based on three different Global Climate Models for the 2050 period (scenarios A2a and B2a). Model performance was evaluated using the jackknife approach. Climatic niche breadth and climatic niche similarities were calculated through Levin's concentration metrics and the I statistic index (implemented in ENMTools), respectively. Maxent logistic outputs were converted into binary presence/absence maps, based on the minimum training presence logistic threshold', and used to build species richness maps for each condition considered (present and future). Current and future models with areas climatically suitable for small ponds were developed. All the study species proved to be narrow specialists and share similar climatic spaces. Our projections suggest that four of the species would not find suitable climate conditions for survival in the future. The priority area for conservation, where most species would find suitable climate conditions, is located between 33-47 degrees S and 73-70 degrees W. We identified future loss of the priority area towards the east and a small gain towards the north and south. The most probable situation for the year 2050 is a negative precipitation-evapotranspiration balance, and small ponds will probably be very short-lived or dry completely during summer, suggesting a drastic change in species assemblages and species richness of the region, which could become a hotspot of extinction.",,,,,"Melo, Maria Cecilia/0000-0003-4612-452X","CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); FonCyT (Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica)FONCyT [PICT 2013-1539, PICT 2014-0488]","We would like to thank Teresa Patricia Feria Arroyo (The University of Texas-Pan American, USA) for sharing environmental data and Sergio Roig (IADIZA, Mendoza, Argentina) for critical reading of the manuscript.

LEP.; SPECIATION; DIFFERENTIATION; NOTODONTIDAE; LEPIDOPTERA; REGRESSION; DISPERSAL; DIAPAUSE; PACKAGE,"AimAllochronic speciation occurs when sympatric populations sharing similar feeding regimes diverge because they mate at different times. Such speciation mode is fascinating because it permits the study of subsequent adaptations and/or geographic range shifts undergone by the populations that face new ecological constraints. Moreover, exploring whether intraspecific differentiation is accompanied by niche divergence is crucial for planning efficient biodiversity management and invasive species control. Here, we address the topic of potential climatic niche divergence between two sympatric populations of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (PPM) that diverged under allochrony. The larval development of a PPM population recently discovered in coastal regions of Portugal, referred to as the summer population (SP), occurs in the spring-summer instead of the autumn-winter as for all other populations of this species. LocationPortugal. MethodsWe carried out intensive field sampling in the area where both populations are sympatric and calibrated spread (MigClim approach) and species distribution models (ensemble forecasting approach) to depict the response of SP to environment and predict its potential range under current and future climatic conditions. ResultsSince its discovery in 1997, the distribution of SP has been expanding along the Western coasts of Portugal. Still, its establishment in inland regions failed, even though suitable hosts occur. Our models identify maximal temperatures as the main constraint explaining SP absence from inland regions. The coastal area where winter populations and SP co-occur displays unique climatic conditions (moderate maximal and minimal temperatures), which enable the coexistence of these populations with totally different phenologies. The models predict a future decrease of SP range due to climate warming. Main conclusionsWe show here that a climatic niche shift occurred following allochronic divergence. This study highlights how climate differentially affects allochronic populations and how considering intraspecific diversity is crucial when predicting species responses to climate change.",,,,"Rasplus, Jean-Yves/O-2873-2017; Branco, Manuela/D-5274-2011","Rasplus, Jean-Yves/0000-0001-8614-6665; Branco, Manuela/0000-0002-8140-1257; Rossi, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-8139-1116; Paiva, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-8945-4345; Kerdelhue, Carole/0000-0001-7667-902X",INRA Metaprogram SMACH (Sustainable Management of Crop Health),This work was supported by the INRA Metaprogram SMACH (Sustainable Management of Crop Health).

However, little work has focused on the systematic evaluation of how well adult mosquito abundance can be predicted as a function of observational resolutions, aggregation scales, and prediction lead time. We use a state space reconstruction (SSR) approach to compare the predictability of mosquito population dynamics at weekly, biweekly, and monthly scales. We focus on the analysis of Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura populations monitored in Brunswick County (North Carolina, USA) and find that prediction over a 7-d lead time is improved when daily observations are used, compared to the commonly used once-per-week sample. Our results demonstrate that daily observations of mosquito abundance contribute to improving mosquito predictability in two ways: (1) daily observations better capture fluctuations over short timescales, which are missed when sampling at coarser resolutions, and (2) the aggregation of daily abundance observations reduces the impact of noise, thereby increasing the predictability of mosquito population dynamics as the aggregation scale is increased. We show that the evaluation of population dynamical models based on observed and predicted abundance can lead to a spuriously high apparent performance, due to the high autocorrelation in the observations used to update the model state at each successive time step. We show that the comparison of predicted and observed population change, expressed through per capita growth rates, leads to a more informative performance measure.",,,,"Marani, Marco/F-9451-2016; Marani, Marco/S-6125-2019","Marani, Marco/0000-0002-1493-6913; Marani, Marco/0000-0002-1493-6913; SILVESTRI, SONIA/0000-0002-5114-8633",,,,,3,3,2,21,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

However, a rapidly changing climate and altered disturbance regimes are calling into question the usefulness of this approach. As a consequence, restoration goals are increasingly focused on creating communities that are resilient to novel environmental stressors and emphasis is being placed on defining functional targets through the use of plant traits. While changes in forest structure and composition have received much attention, long-term changes in stand-level functional traits are not well understood. We used dendrochronology to reconstruct historical forest structure and composition in 1880, the year immediately following the disruption of the natural fire regime in a mixed conifer forest in Arizona, USA. We analysed the differences in pre-settlement and contemporary forest composition, structure and community-weighted mean (CWM) traits, and functional diversity metrics (Rao's Q and functional richness) for four plant functional traits: leaf nitrogen content (leaf N), specific leaf area (SLA), wood density and bark thickness. We observed significant shifts in forest composition, structure, CWM traits and functional diversity from 1880 to 2011. These changes reflect a reduction in fire and drought tolerance, driven largely by increases in the relative importance of Abies concolor and Pinus strobiformis. Compositional changes were associated with declines in CWM leaf N, SLA, wood density and bark thickness. We found lower multitrait functional diversity (Rao's Q) in contemporary forests driven primarily by leaf N; however, bark thickness variation was greater in contemporary forests than in 1880.Synthesis and applications. Compositional shifts towards reduced average bark thickness and wood density in contemporary forests driven by land-use change have likely reduced forest resilience to both fire and drought. Managers can manipulate forest structure and species composition to achieve functional objectives by increasing stand-level bark thickness to promote fire tolerance and increasing stand-level wood density to promote drought tolerance. Forecasts for extended fire seasons along with declining precipitation are projected for many ecosystems around the planet. A focus on restoring optimal functional trait combinations may be as important as managing ecosystem structure for restoring resilient ecosystems.

Substantial gaps remains in our knowledge of the turtle behaviour during the remaining inter-reproductive period, that spans over 2-3 years. We report the results of a prolonged tracking experiment on loggerhead turtles nesting along the Ionian Calabria, the main breeding ground in Italy. Argos satellite transmitters were deployed on eight females, a sample representing a substantial fraction of the overall population (20-25 nesting females). All turtles but one were tracked for > 300 days (range: 313-1523 days), revealing their spatial behaviour during a complete reproductive cycle and providing novel information on a number of poorly-known aspects of loggerhead spatial ecology: i) the post-nesting migratory strategy resulted in accordance with that of most adult loggerheads tracked so far, as the nine routes of six turtles were directed towards specific sites all located in the Tunisian continental shelf, a main foraging area for Mediterranean turtles; ii) the pre-breeding migratory routes were rather variable, likely deriving from different navigational strategies adopted by migrating turtles, and their temporal pattern indicates that mating occurred away from the nesting area; iii) the 10 inter-nesting movements of four turtles revealed unusual long-distance loops mostly in oceanic waters (median of maximum distance from nesting location: 145.5 km); iv) while at the foraging grounds, four turtles occupied distinct areas during summer and winter, making directed movements between the two sites, seasonal core areas were separated and their size was larger in winter than in summer (median: 498 km(2) vs. 258 km(2)); v) individual females displayed an high fidelity to both sites in successive years. These findings further highlight the plasticity in loggerhead spatial behaviour and the importance of the Central Mediterranean and of the Tunisian shelf for loggerhead conservation.

Quantification and control of these by analytical or sensory means are not presently practical for RAS farmers. To forecast taste taint in RAS, a time-dependent model was synthesised (Ecological Modelling 291 (2014) 242-249). Here we report for the first time an extensive two-year validation study of this model with commercial RAS farmed barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in which fingerlings (similar to 0.01 kg) were grown to harvest (similar to 0.85 kg) at 245 days. The concentration of GSM and MIB in the growth water and fish-flesh was determined (weekly) using Headspace Solid-Phase Micro-Extraction, followed by Gas Chromatography Mass-Spectroscopy (and microwave-mediated distillation). The concentration of both taint chemicals in the RAS growth water was controlled using continuous dosing of hydrogen peroxide (2.5 mg L-1) as a benign biocide. A special dosing apparatus was developed for this purpose. Results showed, generally, very good agreement between observed and predicted taint values in the range 0-2 mu g kg(-1), and especially below the important consumer rejection threshold (<similar to 0.7 mu g kg(-1)). A minor anomaly was a general over-prediction of chemical in about a half of the N=706 simulations in the range 0-12 mu g kg(-1). Predictions were conservative therefore i.e. on the 'safe' side. This is attributed, largely, to dissimilar (exponential) growth constant (gamma) for smaller and larger fish, and the fact that the RAS environment is oscillatory. Findings highlight that the work could be meaningfully applied to RAS systems to develop protocols to limit taste taint in harvested fish. Significantly, these results are the first for RAS farmed-fish covering an entire production cycle from fingerlings to harvest. The work will be of immediate benefit and interest to RAS farmers, selling agents and researchers. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Four check dams were removed in Kaoshan Stream between 1999 and 2001 to help restore the natural habitat, and we construct an age-structured stochastic simulation model to quantify the effect of this dam removal on salmon abundance. Typhoons are an important factor in the population dynamics, and the presence of dams may augment the mortality associated with typhoons. We define an annual typhoon score that measures the impact of typhoons on salmon survival. We found that habitat restoration resulting from dam removal is a more significant factor than the creation of upstream passage in increasing survival and that juveniles receive the largest benefit. The model predicts that the salmon in Kaoshan Stream would have disappeared by 2007 if the dams had not been removed, indicating that dam removal was effective in increasing abundance. To project the model forward 20 years, we use historical data to forecast future typhoon scores. The model projects that after dim removal, the salmon population will stabilize just below 400 by 2018, which indicates growth from the most recent observed value of 262 in 2014. We then modify the forecasted typhoon scores to include anticipated increases in typhoon intensity associated with climate change. All of these scenarios result in a downward rather than stable trend in abundance, with larger increases in the typhoon score associated with faster rates of decline in the population. However, the population remains above 100 over the next 20 years even in scenarios with high typhoon scores. The model suggests that dam removal reversed the salmon population decline, but the anticipated increase in rain intensity associated with climate change poses a future threat to the salmon.

One of the challenging research problems is to extend the black-box modeling into white-box modeling in order to gain insights into the physical processes. Sensitivity analysis has shown a great contribution in overcoming this challenge. The main objective of this study was to perform a detailed sensitivity analysis of recurrent neural network in order to identify parameters that are important for predicting water quality constituents. We used a windrow composting pad located at UGA Bioconversion center, Athens, GA, USA as our study site. Runoff from windrow composting pad was collected in order to prevent the discharge of organic pollutants. We used time series data from nine years of precipitation, temperature, pond volume, material volume on the pad, total suspended solids (TSS), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrate (NO3) concentration levels of stored runoff in the collection pond. Previously, we applied recurrent neural network for predicting TSS, BOD and NO3 as well as performed auto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis (Shim and Tollner, 2014). We used first eight years of data (from January 2001 to December 2008) to build the model and last year of data (from January 2009 to December 2009) to evaluate the model. Within this paper, we showed that the detailed sensitivity analysis of recurrent neural network can allow a better understanding of water quality dynamics of collected runoff and assist in identifying strategies for better management of windrow composting systems.

The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs-average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass-from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially.

Mathematical and statistical models play a critical role in this process by integrating data from multiple sources in a way that is honest about uncertainty. We show the utility of Bayesian hierarchical models for supporting decisions on managing natural resources of national parks. These models can assimilate monitoring data to provide true forecasts, resulting in probabilistic predictions of future states of park ecosystems accompanied by rigorous estimates of uncertainty. We discuss a novel approach for communicating these forecasts to decision makers who need to evaluate the probability that NPS goals will be met given different management actions, including the null model of no action. We illustrate how this approach has been used successfully to inform decisions on the elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population management in Rocky Mountain National Park based on 47 yr of monitoring data. Forecasts from a discrete time, stage-structured population model assimilated with annual census and sex and age classifications are being used annually to help park managers decide on actions needed to meet goals for elk and vegetation. In particular, park managers were able to determine the probability that the elk population would fall within a desired population range, which led to both population reduction actions and no action depending on the year of interest. Moreover, this approach allowed multiple survey methodologies from the last 47 years to be incorporated into a single model with associated estimates of uncertainty. Models like this one are especially useful for adaptive management where continuous improvement in models and data results in long-term improvement in the wisdom of policy and management.",,,,,,National Park Service [P1AC00782]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1145200],"Data were provided by the National Park Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

Increases above summertime means in seawater temperature, sunlight intensity, turbidity, or sedimentation may reduce coral immunocompetency and increase disease and bleaching susceptibility. We analyzed temporal patterns in innate immunity parameters over nine time points throughout one year to establish baseline levels from which anomalies might be detected for representative species from three major reef-building coral families (Acroporidae, Faviidae, and Poritidae). Temporal patterns in both phenoloxidase activity and expression of green fluorescent protein-like proteins varied among the three families, as did overall constitutive levels. For example, Porites cylindrica had 2.8-fold higher yearly average levels of phenoloxidase activity than Acropora millepora, which had the lowest levels. In contrast, mean fluorescence was lowest in Acropora millepora and highest in Echinopora mammiformis. Relationships between the potential physical drivers (seasonal variation in seawater temperature, rainfall, salinity) and temporal patterns in these parameters also differed among the three species. For example, phenoloxidase activity was positively correlated with seawater temperature in A. millepora, but negatively correlated in both E. mammiformis and P. cylin-drica. Distinctions in constitutive levels and temporal patterns in these parameters among species suggest that corals from these three families have evolved different strategies for investing resources into innate immune parameters. Such differences highlight the need for species-specific baselines and long-term assessments to accurately predict coral reef trajectories in rapidly changing environments.",,,,"van de Water, Jeroen/F-1302-2011; van Oppen, Madeleine JH/C-3261-2008; Heron, Scott/E-7928-2011; Lamb, Joleah/D-1994-2018","van de Water, Jeroen/0000-0001-6974-2270; Lamb, Joleah/0000-0002-7005-9994; Heron, Scott/0000-0001-5262-6978; van Oppen, Madeleine/0000-0003-4607-0744",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Orpheus Island Research Station is thanked for logistical support.

In the first model (Model 1) the quarterly recruitment is modeled considering eastern Pacific global oceanographic conditions: the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and spawners biomass. In Model 2, recruitment is predicted based on sea surface temperature, wind magnitude, and oceanic current magnitude of a smaller area within the eastern Pacific Ocean, considered as relevant for spawning and recruitment, and total spawners biomass. The correlation coefficient between the ANN recruitment estimate and the ""real"" recruitment is r > 0.80 in both models. Series of sensitivity analysis suggest that the SOI and the sea surface temperature are the most important variables for the recruitment in Model 1 and Model 2 also show that warm sea surface favors recruitment.

Location Italian Alps. Methods We assessed the extent of the possible future conflict between skiing and biodiversity by predicting locations likely to be suitable for both skiing and for high-elevation birds in the Italian Alps by modelling ski-piste and species presence in relation to climate, topography and habitat. Potential conflict was assessed by comparing the overlap of areas projected as suitable for skiing and those suitable for four high-elevation bird species under different scenarios of climate change for the year 2050. Results Areas suitable for both ski-pistes and birds were projected to contract towards upper elevations, which for birds resulted in an average decrease of 58-67% of suitable area. The degree of overlap between species and skiing was projected to increase, especially for the most valuable sites, that is, those hosting the most species, or the most threatened species. Main conclusions Given the alarming range contractions forecast for high-elevation species, and the potential impact of ski-pistes on those species, it is essential to safeguard high-mountain grasslands against negative effects of ski development. An effective conservation strategy at a landscape scale needs to consider prevention of ski-piste construction in sites of high conservation value. The approach developed here provides a means by which such a strategy could be formulated, and which could be potentially applied elsewhere to investigate the effect of human adaptation on biodiversity.",,,,,"ROLANDO, Antonio/0000-0002-3432-1780; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652","LIFE+ project [LIFE11 NAT/IT/044 GES-TIRE, LIFE11/IT/187 T.E.N.]; Accordo di Programma per la Ricerca PAT/MUSE; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU)","G.

On the evolutionary continuum from freeze-intolerant (i.e., freeze-avoidant) to freeze-tolerant insects, intermediates likely exist that can withstand some ice formation, but not enough to be considered fully freeze tolerant. Theory suggests that freeze tolerance should be favored over freeze avoidance among individuals that have low relative fitness before exposure to cold. For phytophagous insects, numerous studies have shown that host (or nutrition) can affect fitness and cold-tolerance strategy, respectively, but no research has investigated whether changes in fitness caused by different hosts of polyphagous species could lead to systematic changes in cold-tolerance strategy. We tested this relationship with the invasive, polyphagous moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker). Host affected components of fitness, such as larval survivorship rates, pupal mass, and immature developmental times. Host species also caused a dramatic change in survival of late-instar larvae after the onset of freezing-from less than 8% to nearly 80%. The degree of survival after the onset of freezing was inversely correlated with components of fitness in the absence of cold exposure. Our research is the first empirical evidence of an evolutionary mechanism that may drive changes in cold-tolerance strategies. Additionally, characterizing the effects of host plants on insect cold tolerance will enhance forecasts of invasive species dynamics, especially under climate change.",,,,,,National Science Foundation-Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship on Introduced Species and Genotypes program at the University of Minnesota [DGE-0653827]; University of Minnesota Marion Brooks Wallace and Graduate School Fellowship; University of Minnesota's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program; US Department of Agriculture-Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation-Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship on Introduced Species and Genotypes program at the University of Minnesota [DGE-0653827; to ACM.]; the University of Minnesota Marion Brooks Wallace and Graduate School Fellowship [to ACM.]; the University of Minnesota's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program [to LAM.]; and the US Department of Agriculture-Forest Service [to RCV and ECN].,,,8,8,1,22,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Projected modification of current ambient temperature in the future is expected to result in shifts in whole-organismal performance, which could lead to a diminishment in individual fitness, resulting in demographic collapse. The anticipated responses of ectothermic organisms to climate change focus on the direct effects of temperature and neglect other potential concomitant changes to the environment. Climate models forecast dramatic alteration in precipitation patterns, which in some regions will lead to prolonged drought. Rising temperatures coupled with decreased rainfall will disrupt patterns of net primary productivity and as a consequence alter the prey base and seasonal food availability. Individuals exposed to lower food availability are expected to adjust thermoregulatory behaviour to reduce their daily energetic expenditures. The consequences of fasting in lizards have received scant attention; consequently, we examined the effects of alteration in food availability on both preferred body temperatures in a thermal gradient and the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance in the lizard Urosaurus ornatus. We experimentally manipulated food access to two groups of lizards and compared thermal preference and thermal performance curves. We found distinct shifts in preferred body temperature and locomotor performance when food availability is restricted. Fasted lizards exhibited reduced preferred body temperatures compared to fed lizards. The position and shape of thermal performance curves differed between fasted and fed lizards. Fasted lizards had lower optimal temperatures of performance and wider thermal performance breadths than fed lizards. Restricted access to food resources leads to thermal biological patterns favouring lower temperatures. Lizards with low food access may be restricted to shaded regions of their habitat, unable to cope with the stressful situation of activity at warmer temperatures, and thus be at a selective disadvantage for procuring energetic or reproductive opportunities. By characterizing the interaction between thermal physiology and food availability, our study provides more clarification regarding the bioenergetic pressures likely to affect lizards in warmer environments.",,,,,,Ohio University Graduate Student Senate Original Work Grant; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Elizabeth Marks for providing assistance in capturing and maintaining lizards in the laboratory.

The latter property should be especially relevant during extreme weather conditions, which are forecast to increase under anthropogenic climate change. We investigated the buffering capacity of Eucalyptus oleosa F.Muell. ex Miq. subsp. oleosa tree hollows in semi-arid southern Australia for 28 days under a wide range of ambient temperatures. Tree hollows provided more stable microclimates than ambient conditions, maintaining lower temperatures and higher humidity during the day and higher temperatures and lower humidity during the night. Daytime buffering capacity increased slightly with depth and we recorded a maximum buffering of 15.1 degrees C below ambient temperatures. Maximum day time buffering capacity increased at a rate of approximately 0.6 degrees C per 1 degrees C increase in ambient temperature, meaning that maximum buffering capacity was reached during the hottest periods. The high buffering capacity of tree hollows suggests that old trees with deep hollows are important in facilitating the persistence of fauna during extreme weather events.

We review recent innovations in the family of methods used to forecast global environmental change, and offer constructive critiques of five common approaches: phenomenological projections, storyline scenarios, integrated assessment models, decomposition-identity approaches, and global climate simulations. Overall, there is a lack of coherent, empirically based validation for many methods and their assumptions, and only partial incorporation of underlying uncertainties in both parameter estimates and interrelationships of model components.

Besides manifold anthropogenic influences in this region, global climate change is forecast to lead to significant changes in temperatures and precipitation. We here analysed stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of feathers of both bird species and their potential dietary plants across a longitudinal precipitation gradient in south-east Switzerland. Plant delta C-13 was higher at higher altitudes and in drier areas (coinciding with higher longitudes) while plant delta N-15 did not differ geographically. Black grouse delta C-13 reflected the longitudinal pattern in precipitation and plant delta C-13, and there was no indication for a change in dietary composition with precipitation (i.e. no significant changes in delta N-15). In contrast, rock ptarmigan delta C-13 was independent of precipitation and plant delta C-13 values and showed a significant increase in delta N-15 towards drier areas, suggesting a potential dietary shift. In rock ptarmigan, we furthermore investigated intraspecific differences with age, between males and females and among years, and did not find any biologically meaningful intraspecific differences. Interspecifically, rock ptarmigan feathers had significantly higher delta C-13 and lower delta N-15 values than black grouse, reflecting a dietary segregation between both species. This may partly he due to the higher attitudinal distribution of rock ptarmigan in combination with an attitudinal gradient in plant delta C-13. In addition, however, species also segregated in delta N-15, most likely caused by a higher proportion of invertebrate diet in black grouse.",,,,"Segelbacher, Gernot/F-3633-2011; Dehnhard, Nina/H-6160-2016; Yohannes, Elizabeth/AAM-4457-2020","Segelbacher, Gernot/0000-0002-8024-7008; Dehnhard, Nina/0000-0002-4182-2698; ","Otto Wolff Stiftung; FWO-FlandersFWO [1265414N, 12Q6915N]","Saskia Rehse, Corinna Waider, Claudia Greis and Wolfgang Kornberger helped with stable isotope analyses and Marc Mischke with generating the GIS plots.

Violations may seriously affect ENM reliability, leading to erroneous biogeographic conclusions and inappropriate conservation prioritisation. We evaluate the robustness of ENMs against incomplete knowledge of distribution with a real example, the threatened Iberian lizard Podarcis carbonelli, whose distribution was gradually discovered over a long time period. We used several ENM methods for presence-only data (Maxent, ENFA, Bioclim, and Domain) to infer the realised ecological niche at two spatial resolutions (1 km and 200 m). The distribution data were split into four partial datasets corresponding to separate subranges: Central System (CS); Viseu-Aveiro (VA); Atlantic coast (AC); and Dofiana (DO). We then accumulated the datasets following the species discovery sequence: CS + VA, CS + VA + AC, and CS + VA + AC + DO. Niche equivalence and similarity between partial models were compared using Ecospat ENMs were strongly affected by the violation of niche equilibrium; only the VA subrange forecasts the complete species range. ENMs were also sensitive to the violation of niche equality: only VA models were similar to the Iberian model, altitude being the most important variable followed by annual precipitation, maximum temperature in July, and annual radiation. When the ENMs were applied only to the first subrange discovered (CS), only the VA area was predicted, while the other subranges might have remained unknown, thus compromising conservation strategies. As assumptions of niche equilibrium and equality were violated, likely owing to the species' ecological multimodality, the models generated were biased and of limited predictive value. ENMs are useful tools in biogeography and conservation, but only if their basal assumptions are achieved. Partial models may be useful if they are considered as representing different suitable habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Understanding climate change impacts on successional trajectories of these ecosystems is critical for developing effective large-scale forest landscape restoration (FLR) programs. Differences in environmental conditions, species composition, dynamics, and landscape context from old growth forests may exacerbate climate impacts on second growth stands. We compile data from 112 studies on the effects of natural climate variability, including warming, droughts, fires, and cyclonic storms, on demography and dynamics of second growth forest trees and identify variation in forest responses across biomes, regions, and landscapes. Across studies, drought decreases tree growth, survival, and recruitment, particularly during early succession, but the effects of temperature remain unexplored. Shifts in the frequency and severity of disturbance alter successional trajectories and increase the extent of second growth forests. Vulnerability to climate extremes is generally inversely related to long-term exposure, which varies with historical climate and biogeography. The majority of studies, however, have been conducted in the Neotropics hindering generalization. Effects of fire and cyclonic storms often lead to positive feedbacks, increasing vulnerability to climate extremes and subsequent disturbance. Fragmentation increases forests' vulnerability to fires, wind, and drought, while land use and other human activities influence the frequency and intensity of fire, potentially retarding succession. Comparative studies of climate effects on tropical forest succession across biogeographic regions are required to forecast the response of tropical forest landscapes to future climates and to implement effective FLR policies and programs in these landscapes.",,,,"Werden, Leland K/J-1208-2019","Werden, Leland K/0000-0002-3579-4352; Liao, Wenying/0000-0001-8777-1817; Marin-Spiotta, Erika/0000-0001-7343-9354","NSF CNH-RCN Grant [1313788]; NSF EF Macrosystems [1137239]; NSF CAREER GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DEB 1053237, BCS 1349952]","We acknowledge support from NSF CNH-RCN Grant 1313788 to R.

While these models have generally been developed as separate applications, each with a separate purpose and audience, they share many common features. We present a general framework, called a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM), which captures a number of these common features, accompanied by a software product, called ST-Sim, to build and run such models. The STSM method divides a landscape into a set of discrete spatial units and simulates the discrete state of each cell forward as a discrete-time-inhomogeneous stochastic process. The method differs from a spatially interacting Markov chain in several important ways, including the ability to add discrete counters such as age and time-since-transition as state variables, to specify one-step transition rates as either probabilities or target areas, and to represent multiple types of transitions between pairs of states. We demonstrate the STSM method using a model of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change for the state of Hawai'i, USA. Processes represented in this example include expansion/contraction of agricultural lands, urbanization, wildfire, shrub encroachment into grassland and harvest of tree plantations; the model also projects shifts in moisture zones due to climate change. Key model output includes projections of the future spatial and temporal distribution of LULC classes and moisture zones across the landscape over the next 50years. State-and-transition simulation models can be applied to a wide range of landscapes, including questions of both land-use change and vegetation dynamics. Because the method is inherently stochastic, it is well suited for characterizing uncertainty in model projections. When combined with the ST-Sim software, STSMs offer a simple yet powerful means for developing a wide range of models of landscape dynamics.",,,,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry,"This work was financially supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CGS and Forest Complexity Modelling Program for CD) and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.

Both microalgae are associated with toxic events. Therefore, understanding their population dynamics and predict their occurrence in short-term is crucial for an optimal management of toxic events for the local shellfish production and ecosystem managers. Artificial neural networks have been successfully used to model the complex nonlinear dynamics of phytoplankton. In this study, this approach was applied to predict absence-presence and abundance of Karlodinium and Pseudo-nitzschia microalgae in Alfacs Bay (NW Mediterranean) using biological and/or environmental variables. Neural Interpretation Diagram (NID) and Connection Weight Approach (CWA) methodologies were applied to obtain ecological information from the models. The dataset used was long-term (1990-2015) time series of environmental and phytoplankton variables from different monitoring stations established in Alfacs Bay (Ebre Delta), meteorological data and Ebre River flow rates. Several models were presented. The best ones were achieved for one-week ahead procedures performed with environmental and biological variables using all the available data. A sensitivity analysis showed the larger the data set used, the better the models obtained. However, Karlodinium absence presence models developed with five years of data present high accuracy. The size of the neural networks denotes complex relationships between environmental and phytoplankton variables. The environmental variables had stronger influence on the abundance models while biological variables had more importance in the absence-presence models. These results highlight a complex ecosystem in Alfacs Bay involving anthropogenic, climatic and hydrologic factors forcing phytoplankton dynamics. In addition, a change in the ecosystem dynamics regarding Karlodinium is detected. The configuration and the accuracy achieved with the models allow their use in different real-world applications as automated systems and/or monitoring programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the physically distributed nature of data resources and of expertise in advanced analytical tools creates many challenges for the modern scientist. Across the wider biological sciences, presenting such capabilities on the Internet (as ""Web services"") and using scientific workflow systems to compose them for particular tasks is a practical way to carry out robust ""in silico"" science. However, use of this approach in biodiversity science and ecology has thus far been quite limited. Results: BioVeL is a virtual laboratory for data analysis and modelling in biodiversity science and ecology, freely accessible via the Internet. BioVeL includes functions for accessing and analysing data through curated Web services; for performing complex in silico analysis through exposure of R programs, workflows, and batch processing functions; for on- line collaboration through sharing of workflows and workflow runs; for experiment documentation through reproducibility and repeatability; and for computational support via seamless connections to supporting computing infrastructures. We developed and improved more than 60 Web services with significant potential in many different kinds of data analysis and modelling tasks. We composed reusable workflows using these Web services, also incorporating R programs. Deploying these tools into an easy-to-use and accessible 'virtual laboratory', free via the Internet, we applied the workflows in several diverse case studies. We opened the virtual laboratory for public use and through a programme of external engagement we actively encouraged scientists and third party application and tool developers to try out the services and contribute to the activity. Conclusions: Our work shows we can deliver an operational, scalable and flexible Internet-based virtual laboratory to meet new demands for data processing and analysis in biodiversity science and ecology. In particular, we have successfully integrated existing and popular tools and practices from different scientific disciplines to be used in biodiversity and ecological research.",,,,"Balech, Bachir/Q-4992-2018; DELEO, FRANCESCA/O-3680-2019; Horvath, Ferenc/R-4965-2019; Sipos, Gyorgy/D-9287-2011; Donvito, Giacinto/AAC-9872-2020; Pesole, Graziano/K-5283-2019; Fosso, Bruno/P-1538-2018; Horvath, Ferenc/K-3734-2019; Vos, Rutger A/H-9032-2012; Hardisty, Alex/C-3155-2009","Balech, Bachir/0000-0002-4419-0729; DELEO, FRANCESCA/0000-0003-0421-7699; Donvito, Giacinto/0000-0002-0628-1080; Fosso, Bruno/0000-0003-2324-086X; Horvath, Ferenc/0000-0002-1317-1269; Vos, Rutger A/0000-0001-9254-7318; Nieva de la Hidalga, Abraham/0000-0001-7348-7612; Fernandez-Guerra, Antonio/0000-0002-8679-490X; Yilmaz, Pelin/0000-0003-4724-323X; Hardisty, Alex/0000-0002-0767-4310; Lyytikainen-Saarenmaa, Paivi/0000-0003-1884-3084; Fellows, Donal/0000-0002-9091-5938",European Union 7th Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU) [283359]; Swedish LifeWatch project - Swedish Research Council [829-2009-6278],"The work reported in this article has been performed by the Biodiversity Virtual e-Laboratory (BioVeL) project (http://www.biovel.eu) funded by the European Union 7th Framework Programme, Grant no. 283359 (2011-2014).

We evaluated the impacts of 43 years of fertilization under a soybean (Glycine max) based cropping system on temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition (Q(10)) in an Alfisol. Treatments were: no mineral fertilizer or manure (control), 100% recommended dose of nitrogen (N), N and phosphorus (NP), N, P and potassium (NPK), NPK+lime at 0.4 Mg ha(-1) (NPK+L), 150% recommended NPK (150% NPK), and NPK+farmyard manure (FYM) at 10 Mg ha(-1) (NPK+FYM). Bulk soils as well as macro- and micro-aggregates were incubated for 24 days at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Cumulative SOC mineralization (C-t) in the 0-15 cm soil layer of bulk soils with NPK+FYM and NPK treated plots were similar but significantly higher than unfertilized control plots. However, both C-t and Q(10) values in the NPK+FYM plots were higher than NPK in the 15-30 cm soil layer. In the 0-15 cm soil layer, NPK + FYM plots had similar to 10 and 26% greater Q(10) values of macro- and microaggregates than NPK. Activation energies required for bulk soils C mineralization was similar to 2 and 3 times higher in NPK+FYM and NPK+L plots, respectively, compared with unfertilized control plots in that layer. Lime along with NPK application increased the activation energy of SOC decomposition. Thus, long-term NPK+FYM and NPK+L applications have great potential for less proportional SOC decomposition than NPK or unfertilized control plots under a temperature rise in these acid soils. However, NPK+FYM management practice is recommended as it has highest SOC accumulation and can have less SOC losses under a temperature rise. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, climatic intensification forecasts suggest southeastern USA may emulate more tropical or subtropical growing conditions resulting in altered N dynamics and plant physiology. Objectives were to determine: (i) effects of biochar (1 and 2 Mg ha(-1)), two intercropped legumes [sunn hemp (Crotaiaria juncea L.) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L) intercrops] versus inorganic N [67 kg ha-land 0 kg ha(-1)] on feedstock and soil characteristics and biomass yield; (ii) how feedstock composition is affected over three harvest dates; and, (iii) switchgrass adaptation to more extreme (tropical) growing conditions. For both species, yield and feedstock composition were influenced by harvest timing (P < 0.05), whereas soil amendments influenced composition to a lesser extent over the duration of this study (P > 0.05). In general, initial harvests had greater digestible 5- and 6-carbon sugars and N, P, and K tissue levels, whereas in subsequent harvests, higher acid- and neutral-detergent fiber levels were observed, suggesting lesser potential fermentability. Desired feedstock characteristics can therefore be manipulated by harvest timing. Yield results suggest pigeon pea and sunn hemp intercrops, and biochar (1 Mg ha(-1)) may result in equivalent yields as N fertilizer per harvest (P < 0.05). However, the 2 Mg ha(-1) biochar rate in the tropics adversely impacted yields, perhaps due to N immobilization by biochar. Switchgrass adaptation and competitiveness was moderate (5-30% weed cover) under an intensified climate. Growth can therefore be maintained under a stochastic climate due to its C-4 pathway and competitive growth on marginal soils.

Compared with the boreal forests in North America and Europe, relatively few research studies have been conducted in Siberian boreal forests. Knowledge related to the role of Siberian forests in the global carbon balance is thus essential for a full understanding of global carbon cycle. This study investigated the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during growing season (May-September) in an eastern Siberian boreal larch forest for a 3-year period in 2004-2006 with contrasting meteorological conditions. The study found that the forest served as a carbon sink during all of the 3 studied years; in addition, the meteorological conditions essentially influenced the specific annual value of the strength of the carbon sinks in each year. Although 2005 was the warmest year and much wetter than 2004, 2005 also featured the greatest amount of ecosystem respiration, which resulted in a minimum value of NEE. The study also found that the phenological changes observed during the three study years had a relatively small effect on annual NEE. Leaf expansion was 26 days earlier in 2005 than in the other 2 years, which resulted in a longer growing season in 2005. However, the NEE in 2005 was counterbalanced by the large rate of ecosystem respiration that was caused by the higher temperatures in the year. This study showed that meteorological variables had larger influences on the interannual variations in NEE for a Siberian boreal larch forest, as compared with phenological changes. The overall results of this study will improve our understanding of the carbon balance of Siberian boreal larch forests and thus can help to forecast the response of these forests to future climate change.",,,,"Liu, Jing/AAM-7323-2020; Guo, Qinghua/B-7731-2012","Guo, Qinghua/0000-0002-1065-0838",National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41301020]; National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956604]; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology of the Japan Science and TechnologyCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST),"The National Science Foundation of China (41301020), National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB956604); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology of the Japan Science and Technology.",,,2,2,1,25,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Furthermore, because of interspecific differences in temperature sensitivity, warming can increase or decrease synchronization between insects and their food plants and natural enemies. Here, I review recent findings in three areas - shifts in phenology, changes in voltinism, and altered species interactions - and highlight counterintuitive responses to warming caused by the particularities of insect life cycles.

In the subtropics, the passage of extreme cold spells functions as a major structuring force for ecological communities, and can incur substantial losses to biodiversity, agriculture, and infrastructure. If these events persist in the future, it is likely that their effects on subtropical communities and ecosystems will become more pronounced, as tropical species migrate poleward. Recent extreme cold spells in subtropical China (2008) and United States (2010) occurred in ecosystems that are the subject of long-term ecological study, enabling key questions about cold spell affects to be addressed. In this study, we (1) discuss the meteorological drivers that resulted in these two extreme cold spells, and (2) use findings from case studies published in the Ecosphere Special Feature on effects of extreme cold spells on the dynamics of subtropical communities, and on poleward expansion of tropical species and other previously published works to identify consistencies of subtropical community resilience and resistance to extreme cold spells. In this review, we highlight three consistent findings related to this particularly type of extreme climate event: (1) cold spells drive predictable community change in the subtropics by altering ratios of coexisting tropical and temperate species; (2) certain landscape features consistently affect subtropical resistance and resilience to extreme cold spells; and (3) native tropical species are more resistant and resilient to extreme cold spells than tropical nonnative taxa.

We overcome this limitation by taking advantage of two recent advances: remotely sensed, species-specific estimates of plant cover and statistical models developed for spatiotemporal dynamics of animal populations. Using computationally efficient model reparameterizations, we fit a spatiotemporal population model to a 28-year time series of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) percent cover over a 2.5 x 5 km landscape in southwestern Wyoming while formally accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We include interannual variation in precipitation and temperature as covariates in the model to investigate how climate affects the cover of sagebrush. We then use the model to forecast the future abundance of sagebrush at the landscape scale under projected climate change, generating spatially explicit estimates of sagebrush population trajectories that have, until now, been impossible to produce at this scale. Our broadscale and long-term predictions are rooted in small-scale and short-term population dynamics and provide an alternative to predictions offered by species distribution models that do not include population dynamics.

Climate projections forecast an increasingly arid climate for the southwestern United States. Therefore, an understanding of the relationships between climate and spring discharge is increasingly important. Monthly discharge measurements were recorded from 2001 to 2014 at three jointed bedrock springs in and near Arches National Park, Utah, United States. Discharge was compared with the potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation derived from Daymet gridded climate data. Despite the similarities in location, aquifer type, and climate exposure, all three springs showed different responses to local climate. Two springs emerging from the western aquifer had decreases in discharge during differing portions of their record, while the eastern aquifer spring had stable discharge. At the monthly scale, there was a strong inverse relationship between measured discharge and PET at all three springs, likely due to vegetation accessing the water prior to its surface expression. Annual average winter discharge from both western aquifer springs responded to reductions in 10-year cumulative winter precipitation, while discharge from the eastern aquifer spring did not correspond well to precipitation within the period of record. Uncertainty in climate projections for aquifer recharge remains high, but increasing air temperatures will likely lead to increased PET and reduced spring surface flow. Better characterization of climate and spring discharge relationships will help managers protect contributing areas that may be more susceptible to groundwater withdrawal and better understand the available habitat for groundwater-dependent ecosystems and species.",,,,,"Weissinger, Rebecca/0000-0002-4726-843X",NPS,"The authors would like to thank Jim Harte, National Park Service (NPS) Water Resources Division, for designing the spring discharge monitoring program.

Yet, the contributions of the leading internal climatic variations to global vegetation productivity are poorly understood. Here, we use 30 years of global satellite observations to study climatic variations controls on continental and global vegetation productivity patterns. El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) phases ( La Nina, neutral, and El Nino years) appear to be a weaker control on global-scale vegetation productivity than previously thought, although continental-scale responses are substantial. There is also clear evidence that other non-ENSO climatic variations have a strong control on spatial patterns of vegetation productivity mainly through their influence on temperature. Among the eight leading internal climatic variations, the East Atlantic/West Russia Pattern extensively controls the ensuing year vegetation productivity of the most productive tropical and temperate forest ecosystems of the Earth's vegetated surface through directionally consistent influence on vegetation greenness. The Community Climate System Model ( CCSM4) simulations do not capture the observed patterns of vegetation productivity responses to internal climatic variations. Our analyses show the ubiquitous control of climatic variations on vegetation productivity and can further guide CCSM and other Earth system models developments to represent vegetation response patterns to unforced variability. Several winter time internal climatic variation indices show strong potentials on predicting growing season vegetation productivity two to six seasons ahead which enables national governments and farmers forecast crop yield to ensure supplies of affordable food, famine early warning, and plan management options to minimize yield losses ahead of time.",,,,"Chen, Jing/AAD-4768-2020; Gonsamo, Alemu/D-1795-2010","Chen, Jing/0000-0002-8682-1293; Gonsamo, Alemu/0000-0002-2461-618X",,,,,36,38,5,72,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Despite its known photosynthetic plasticity in response to temperature, little is known about how temperature affects plant toxicity or about interactions between temperature and drought, which is important because cassava tissues contain high levels of toxic cyanogenic glucosides, a major health and food safety concern. In a controlled glasshouse experiment, plants were grown at 2 daytime temperatures ( 23 degrees C and 34 degrees C), and either well-watered or subject to a 1 month drought prior to harvest at 6 months. The objective was to determine the separate and interactive effects of temperature and drought on growth and toxicity. Both temperature and drought affected cassava physiology and chemistry. While temperature alone drove differences in plant height and above-ground biomass, drought and temperature x drought interactions most affected tuber yield, as well as foliar and tuber chemistry, including C : N, nitrogen and cyanide potential ( CNp; total cyanide released from cyanogenic glucosides). Conditions that most stimulated growth and yield ( well-watered x high temperature) effected a reduction in tuber toxicity, whereas drought inhibited growth and yield, and was associated with increased foliar and tuber toxicity. The magnitude of drought effects on tuber yield and toxicity were greater at high temperature; thus, increases in tuber CNp were not merely a consequence of reduced tuber biomass. Findings confirm that cassava is adaptable to forecast temperature increases, particularly in areas of adequate or increasing rainfall; however, in regions forecast for increased incidence of drought, the effects of drought on both food quality ( tuber toxicity) and yield are a greater threat to future food security and indicate an increasing necessity for processing of cassava to reduce toxicity.",,,,"Gleadow, Roslyn/H-7778-2019","Gleadow, Roslyn/0000-0003-4756-0411; Cavagnaro, Timothy/0000-0002-9922-5677","Australian Government's aid agency, AusAIDAustralian Government; Margaret Clayton Fellowship; ARC Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT120100463]","We gratefully acknowledge The Australian Government's aid agency, AusAID for funding this research through a grant to TRC and RMG.

This model incorporated eutrophication modeling, water resource allocation and trophic status assessment within a general modeling framework. In ISOM, the simulation effort [i.e. environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC)] was used to forecast the concentration of water quality variables to evaluate the lake trophic status under various conditions, while the optimization studies were used to identify the optimal water transfer strategies from a number of alternatives. To solve the model, a surrogate-based genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed in which the support vector regression (SVR) was used to create a set of easy-to-use and rapid-response surrogates for identifying the functional relationships between water transfer and lake trophic status. By replacing the EFDC and the corresponding trophic state index (TSI) equations with the surrogates, the computation efficiency could be improved. The developed ISOM was applied to the inter-basin water transfer management of the Niulanjiang-Dianchi Water Transfer Project (NDWTP) to support the eutrophication restoration of Lake Dianchi. Optimal water transfer schemes for three different remediation durations were generated from the model. The results demonstrated that NDWTP could exert a positive influence on the ecology and environment of Lake Dianchi, and that the trophic level for the Lake Dianchi could be effectively mitigated through the adoption of optimal water transfer schemes.

These projections have been coupled with species-area relationships (SAR) to infer extinction rates indirectly as a result of the loss of climatically suitable areas and associated habitat. This approach does not model population dynamics explicitly, and so accepts that extinctions might occur after substantial (but unknown) delays-an extinction debt. Here we explicitly couple bioclimatic envelopemodels of climate and habitat suitability with generic life-history models for 24 species of frogs found in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We show that (i) as many as four species of frogs face imminent extinction by 2080, due primarily to climate change; (ii) three frogs face delayed extinctions; and (iii) this extinction debt will take at least a century to be realized in full. Furthermore, we find congruence between forecast rates of extinction using SARs, and demographic models with an extinction lag of 120 years. We conclude that SAR approaches can provide useful advice to conservation on climate change impacts, provided there is a good understanding of the time lags over which delayed extinctions are likely to occur.",,,,"Hoskin, Conrad J/A-8407-2012; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Williams, Stephen E/A-7250-2008; Fordham, Damien/E-9255-2013","Hoskin, Conrad J/0000-0001-8116-6085; Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Williams, Stephen E/0000-0002-2510-7408; Fordham, Damien/0000-0003-2137-5592",ARC Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT140101192]; ARC Discovery grantAustralian Research Council [DP1096427],The research was funded by an ARC Future Fellowship (FT140101192) awarded to D.A.F. and by an ARC Discovery grant (DP1096427).,,,9,9,1,33,,,,1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

We use tree-ring isotope chronologies (delta C-13 and delta O-18) from live and dead trees from four locations in south-central Alaska, USA, to test whether white spruce trees killed by recent spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) outbreaks showed evidence of drought stress prior to death. Trees that were killed were more sensitive to spring/summer temperature and/or precipitation than trees that survived. At two of our sites, we found greater correlations between the delta C-13 and delta O-18 chronologies and spring/summer temperatures in dead trees than in live trees, suggesting that trees that are more sensitive to temperature-induced drought stress are more likely to be killed. At one site, the difference between delta C-13 in live and dead trees was related to winter/spring precipitation, with dead trees showing stronger correlations between delta C-13 and precipitation, again suggesting increased water stress in dead trees. At all sites where delta O-18 was measured, delta O-18 chronologies showed the greatest difference in climate response between live and dead groups, with delta O-18 in live trees correlating more strongly with late winter precipitation than dead trees. Our results indicate that sites where trees are already sensitive to warm or dry early growing-season conditions experienced the most beetle-kill, which has important implications for forecasting future mortality events in Alaska.",,,,,"Csank, Adam/0000-0002-7001-4470","National Park Service Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit [J8C07100001, J9910324802]; NSF MRI awardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [0923571]","This study was supported by two National Park Service Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit grants to R.

To shed light on factors contributing to background tree mortality, we analyzed detailed pathological data from 200,668 tree-years of observation and 3,729 individual tree deaths, recorded over a 13-yr period in a network of old-growth forest plots in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. We found that: (1) Biotic mortality factors (mostly insects and pathogens) dominated (58%), particularly in larger trees (86%). Bark beetles were the most prevalent (40%), even though there were no outbreaks during the study period; in contrast, the contribution of defoliators was negligible. (2) Relative occurrences of broad classes of mortality factors (biotic, 58%; suppression, 51%; and mechanical, 25%) are similar among tree taxa, but may vary with tree size and growth rate. (3) We found little evidence of distinct groups of mortality factors that predictably occur together on trees. Our results have at least three sets of implications. First, rather than being driven by abiotic factors such as lightning or windstorms, the ambient or random background mortality that many forest models presume to be independent of tree growth rate is instead dominated by biotic agents of tree mortality, with potentially critical implications for forecasting future mortality. Mechanistic models of background mortality, even for healthy, rapidly growing trees, must therefore include the insects and pathogens that kill trees. Second, the biotic agents of tree mortality, instead of occurring in a few predictable combinations, may generally act opportunistically and with a relatively large degree of independence from one another. Finally, beyond the current emphasis on folivory and leaf defenses, studies of broad-scale gradients in the nature and strength of biotic interactions should also include biotic attacks on, and defenses of, tree stems and roots.",,,,,,U.S. National Park Service; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)United States Geological Survey; USGS's Ecosystems and Climate and Land Use Change mission areas,"We thank the many people involved in establishing and maintaining the permanent forest plots, and Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks for their invaluable cooperation and assistance.

However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4 with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4 emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40 degrees to 70 degrees N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4 emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6-15.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the mean and 3.3-6.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the median. The overall annual average (mean +/- SD) is 12 +/- 21 g C m(-2) year(-1) with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4 emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p < .05) reduces CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4 emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4 fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.",,,,"Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Espenberg, Mikk/U-3118-2019; Mander, Ulo/H-3228-2015","Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Espenberg, Mikk/0000-0003-0469-6394; Mander, Ulo/0000-0003-2340-6989",Greenhouse gases Europe project [244122],"Greenhouse gases Europe project (Grant/Award Number: ""244122"").",,,32,33,14,88,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Projections based on widely used static modeling methods implicitly assume that species are in equilibrium with the environment and that detection during surveys is perfect. We used multiseason correlated detection occupancy models, which avoid these assumptions, to relate climate data to distributional shifts of Louisiana Waterthrush in the North American Breeding Bird Survey ( BBS) data. We summarized these shifts with indices of range size and position and compared them to the same indices obtained using more basic modeling approaches. Detection rates during point counts in BBS surveys were low, and models that ignored imperfect detection severely underestimated the proportion of area occupied and slightly overestimated mean latitude. Static models indicated Louisiana Waterthrush distribution was most closely associated with moderate temperatures, while dynamic occupancy models indicated that initial occupancy was associated with diurnal temperature ranges and colonization of sites was associated with moderate precipitation. Overall, the proportion of area occupied and mean latitude changed little during the 1997-2013 study period. Near-term forecasts of species distribution generated by dynamic models were more similar to subsequently observed distributions than forecasts from static models. Occupancy models incorporating a finite mixture model on detection - a new extension to correlated detection occupancy models - were better supported and may reduce bias associated with detection heterogeneity. We argue that replacing phenomenological static models with more mechanistic dynamic models can improve projections of future species distributions. In turn, better projections can improve biodiversity forecasts, management decisions, and understanding of global change biology.",,,,"Nichols, James/AAF-7336-2020; Clement, Matthew J/D-1251-2013; Nichols, James/AAG-1500-2019","Pardieck, Keith/0000-0003-2779-4392; Ziolkowski Jr., David/0000-0002-2500-4417; Clement, Matthew/0000-0003-4231-7949",BBS; USGS Northeast Climate Science Center,"We thank the thousands of highly skilled volunteers who have coordinated and performed the North American Breeding Bird Survey for half a century.

To achieve these body temperatures, butterflies use a combination of morphological, behavioural and physiological mechanisms. Here, we used common garden (without direct solar radiation) and reciprocal transplant (full solar radiation) experiments in the field to determine the thermal sensitivity of flight initiation for two species of Colias butterflies along an elevation gradient in the southwestern Rocky Mountains. The mean body temperature for flight initiation in the field was lower (24-26 degrees C) than indicated by previous studies (28-30 degrees C) in these species. There were small but significant differences in thermal sensitivity of flight initiation between species; high-elevation Colias meadii initiated flight at a lower mean body temperature than lower-elevation Colias eriphyle. Morphological differences (in wing melanin and thoracic setae) drive body temperature differences between species and contributed strongly to differences in the time and probability of flight and air temperatures at flight initiation. Our results suggest that differences both in thermal sensitivity (15% contribution) and in morphology (85% contribution) contribute to the differences in flight initiation between the two species in the field.

Predictive capability of land models for northern wetland CH4 emissions is still low due to limited site measurements, strong spatial and temporal variability in emissions, and complex hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics. To explore this issue, we compare wetland CH4 emission predictions from the Community Land Model 4.5 (CLM4.5-BGC) with siteto regional-scale observations. A comparison of the CH4 fluxes with eddy flux data highlighted needed changes to the model's estimate of aerenchyma area, which we implemented and tested. The model modification substantially reduced biases in CH4 emissions when compared with CarbonTracker CH4 predictions. CLM4.5 CH4 emission predictions agree well with growing season (May-September) CarbonTracker Alaskan regional-level CH4 predictions and sitelevel observations. However, CLM4.5 underestimated CH4 emissions in the cold season (October-April). The monthly atmospheric CH4 mole fraction enhancements due to wetland emissions are also assessed using the Weather Research and Forecasting-Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (WRF-STILT) model coupled with daily emissions from CLM4.5 and compared with aircraft CH4 mole fraction measurements from the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) campaign. Both the tower and aircraft analyses confirm the underestimate of cold-season CH4 emissions by CLM4.5. The greatest uncertainties in predicting the seasonal CH4 cycle are from the wetland extent, cold-season CH4 production and CH4 transport processes. We recommend more cold-season experimental studies in high-latitude systems, which could improve the understanding and parameterization of ecosystem structure and function during this period. Predicted CH4 emissions remain uncertain, but we show here that benchmarking against observations across spatial scales can inform model structural and parameter improvements.",,,,"Torn, Margaret S/D-2305-2015; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Zhang, Zhen/P-4169-2016; Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Zona, Donatella/S-5546-2019; Iwata, Hiroki/B-7679-2008; Hartery, Sean/AAG-7116-2020; Koven, Charles/N-8888-2014; Miller, Charles/G-7854-2017; Raz Yaseef, Naama/D-3385-2015; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010; Sweeney, Colm/AAE-9291-2019; Commane, Roisin/O-3497-2019; Xu, Xiyan/D-2854-2015; Oechel, Walter C/F-9361-2010","Torn, Margaret S/0000-0002-8174-0099; Zhang, Zhen/0000-0003-0899-1139; Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839; Hartery, Sean/0000-0002-0015-2018; Koven, Charles/0000-0002-3367-0065; Raz Yaseef, Naama/0000-0002-7405-1607; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839; Commane, Roisin/0000-0003-1373-1550; Xu, Xiyan/0000-0003-2732-1325; Oechel, Walter C/0000-0002-3504-026X; Chang, Rachel/0000-0003-2337-098X; Poulter, Benjamin/0000-0002-9493-8600","US Department of Energy, BER under RGCM program; NGEE-Arctic project [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Division of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF) [1204263]; National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC005160]; NSF Division of Polar Programs","Funding for this study was provided by the US Department of Energy, BER, under the RGCM program and NGEE-Arctic project under contract no.

We here propose a dispersal barrier-based framework for categorizing release areas according to their compatibility with natural ecological processes under climate change. Setting as a criterion that consistently suitable conditions are forecast over the timeframe considered, we define six translocation types corresponding to six translocation release zones: 'reinforcement' within the 'stable current range'; 'assisted dispersal sensu stricto' within the 'expected novel range'; 'compensatory dispersal' within the 'idealized novel range' (i.e. projected only if simulating absence of anthropogenic dispersal barriers); 'accelerated dispersal' within the 'expected connected envelope' (i.e. the spatiotemporally connected bioclimatic envelope beyond dispersal range); 'accelerated compensatory dispersal' within the 'idealized connected envelope' (i.e. unreachable connected envelope only if simulating absence of anthropogenic dispersal barriers); and 'artificial dispersal' within the 'unconnected envelope' (i.e. separated by natural physical barriers). Analysing projected range change in African antelopes by 2080, translocation across natural dispersal barriers was associated with elevated potential for interspecific competition with allopatric species and hence possible interference with ecosystem function. We argue that where translocation within the indigenous range is not an option, priority ranking of release sites would benefit from explicit consideration of dispersal barriers, favouring projected novel ranges above areas separated by distance and, especially, natural physical obstacles.

One of the priorities is to integrate sites, methodologies, and metrics used in previous work, to develop a set of common protocols and design long-term geographically-balanced, coordinated experiments. The implementation of these collaborative research efforts will also improve our understanding of traditional human-managed systems that encompass significant portions of the sub-Arctic and alpine areas worldwide.

Identification of environmental factors conducive to species range expansion for forecasting species distribution patterns will play a central role in devising management strategies to minimize the conflict between the agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results of a study that predicts the distribution of Indrella ampulla, a snail endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, which is becoming a pest in cardamom (Ellettaria cardamomum) plantations. We determined the distribution patterns and niche overlap between I.ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) niche modeling techniques under current and future (2020-2080) climatic scenarios. The results showed that climatic (precipitation of coldest quarter and isothermality) and soil (cation exchange capacity of soil [CEC]) parameters are major factors that determine the distribution of I.ampulla in Western Ghats. The model predicted cardamom cultivation areas in southern Western Ghats are highly sensitive to invasion of I.ampulla under both present and future climatic conditions. While the land area in the central Western Ghats is predicted to become unsuitable for I.ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum in future, we found 71% of the Western Ghats land area is suitable for Ellettaria cardamomum cultivation and 45% suitable for I.ampulla, with an overlap of 35% between two species. The resulting distribution maps are invaluable for policy makers and conservation managers to design and implement management strategies minimizing the conflicts to sustain agricultural productivity while maintaining biodiversity in the region.",,,,"Gudasalamani, Ravikanth/AAI-5668-2020","Gudasalamani, Ravikanth/0000-0002-9399-8580","Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment, Bangalore, India; NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","The authors thank ATREE small grants, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment, Bangalore, India, and NSERC Canada for financial support.",,,3,5,1,13,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Identifying how species responded to changing environmental conditions not only allows us to explore the mode and tempo of evolution in northern taxa, but also provides a basis for forecasting future biotic response across the highly variable topography of western North America. Using a multilocus approach under a Bayesian coalescent framework, we investigated the phylogeography of a wide-ranging mammal, the long-tailed vole, Microtus longicaudus. We focused on populations along the North Pacific Coast to refine our understanding of diversification by exploring the potentially compounding roles of multiple glacial refugia and more recent fragmentation of an extensive coastal archipelago. Through a combination of genetic data and species distribution models (SDMs), we found that historical climate variability influenced contemporary genetic structure, with multiple isolated locations of persistence (refugia) producing multiple divergent lineages (Beringian or northern, southeast Alaska or coastal, and southern or continental) during glacial advances. These vole lineages all occur along the North Pacific Coast where the confluence of numerous independent lineages in other species has produced overlapping zones of secondary contact, collectively a suture zone.

Unfortunately, information about population demographics prior to threats (i.e., baseline data) is lacking for many species. Perturbations, caused by climate change, disease, or other stressors can lead to population declines and heightened conservation concerns. Boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) have undergone rangewide declines due mostly to the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), with only a few sizable populations remaining in the southern Rocky Mountains, USA, that are disease-free. Despite the apparent region-wide occurrence of Bd, our focal populations in central Colorado were disease free over a 14-year capture-mark-recapture study until the recent discovery of Bd at one of the sites. We used recapture data and the Pradel reverse-time model to assess the influence of environmental and site-specific conditions on survival and recruitment. We then forecast changes in the toad populations with 2 growth models; one using an average lambda value to initiate the projection, and one using the most recent value to capture potential effects of the incursion of disease into the system. Adult survival was consistently high at the 3 sites, whereas recruitment was more variable and markedly low at 1 site. We found that active season moisture, active season length, and breeding shallows were important factors in estimating recruitment. Population growth models indicated a slight increase at 1 site but decreasing trends at the 2 other sites, possibly influenced by low recruitment. Insight into declining species management can be gained from information on survival and recruitment and how site-specific environmental factors influence these demographic parameters. Our data are particularly useful because they provide baseline data on demographics in populations before a disease outbreak and enhance our ability to detect changes in population parameters potentially caused by the disease.

In this sense, eutrophication has caused a variety of impacts, such as high levels of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a). Consequently, anticipate its presence is a matter of importance to prevent future risks. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of the eutrophication in water bodies such as lakes. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach in combination with the artificial bee colony (ABC) technique, for predicting the eutrophication from biological and physical-chemical input parameters determined experimentally through sampling and subsequent analysis in a certificate laboratory. This optimization technique involves hyperparameter setting in the MARS training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical-chemical variables on the eutrophication is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting eutrophication is obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0.85 for the Total phosphorus estimation and 0.84 for the Chlorophyll concentration were obtained when this hybrid ABC-MARS-based model was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter. Finally, conclusions of this innovative research work are exposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use big sagebrush ecosystems as a model dryland ecosystem to explore the impacts of altered climate on ecohydrology and the implications of those changes for big sagebrush plant communities using output from 10 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We ask: (1) What is the magnitude of variability in future temperature and precipitation regimes among GCMs and RCPs for big sagebrush ecosystems, and (2) How will altered climate and uncertainty in climate forecasts influence key aspects of big sagebrush water balance? We explored these questions across 1980-2010, 2030-2060, and 2070-2100 to determine how changes in water balance might develop through the 21st century. We assessed ecohydrological variables at 898 sagebrush sites across the western US using a process-based soil water model, SOILWAT, to model all components of daily water balance using site-specific vegetation parameters and site-specific soil properties for multiple soil layers. Our modeling approach allowed for changes in vegetation based on climate. Temperature increased across all GCMs and RCPs, whereas changes in precipitation were more variable across GCMs. Winter and spring precipitation was predicted to increase in the future (7% by 2030-2060, 12% by 2070-2100), resulting in slight increases in soil water potential (SWP) in winter. Despite wetter winter soil conditions, SWP decreased in late spring and summer due to increased evapotranspiration (6% by 2030-2060, 10% by 2070-2100) and groundwater recharge (26% and 30% increase by 2030-2060 and 2070-2100). Thus, despite increased precipitation in the cold season, soils may dry out earlier in the year, resulting in potentially longer, drier summer conditions. If winter precipitation cannot offset drier summer conditions in the future, we expect big sagebrush regeneration and survival will be negatively impacted, potentially resulting in shifts in the relative abundance of big sagebrush plant functional groups. Our results also highlight the importance of assessing multiple GCMs to understand the range of climate change outcomes on ecohydrology, which was contingent on the GCM chosen.",,,,"Schlaepfer, Daniel R/D-1756-2009; Bradford, John/E-5545-2011","Schlaepfer, Daniel R/0000-0001-9973-2065; Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303; Palmquist, Kyle/0000-0001-7665-4105",University of Wyoming; US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; North Central Climate Science Center; US Department of Interior Geologic Survey; USGS Ecosystems Mission Area,"The work was made possible by funding from the University of Wyoming, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the North Central Climate Science Center, and the US Department of Interior Geologic Survey.

High-profile elimination campaigns are currently underway for many parasites, e.g., Plasmodium spp., the causal agent of malaria. Sustaining momentum near the end of elimination programs is often difficult to achieve and consequently quantitative tools that enable monitoring the effectiveness of elimination activities after the initial reduction of cases has occurred are needed. Documenting progress in vector-borne disease elimination is a potentially important application for the theory of critical transitions. Non-parametric approaches that are independent of model-fitting would advance infectious disease forecasting significantly. In this paper, we consider compartmental Ross-McDonald models that are slowly forced through a critical transition through gradually deployed control measures. We derive expressions for the behavior of candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, and coefficient of variation in the number of human cases during the approach to elimination. We conducted a simulation study to test the performance of each summary statistic as an early warning system of mosquito-borne disease elimination. Variance and coefficient of variation were highly predictive of elimination but autocorrelation performed poorly as an indicator in some control contexts. Our results suggest that tipping points (bifurcations) in mosquito-borne infectious disease systems may be foreshadowed by characteristic temporal patterns of disease prevalence.",,,,,"O'Regan, Suzanne Marie/0000-0002-9446-955X","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U01GM110744]; Georgia GIFT program; RAPIDD program of the Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland SecurityUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville","The authors would like to thank E.

Observations over four decades are compiled and reveal extremely episodic sponge recruitment and growth. Recruitment occurred under different oceanographic conditions on both sides of McMurdo Sound. Most of the sponges appear to have recruited in the late 1990s-2000. Observations from 2000 to 2010 follow thirty years of relative stasis with very little sponge recruitment or growth followed by a general pattern of recruitment by some forty species of sponges. That there was almost no recruitment observed on natural substrata emphasizes the contrast between potential and realized recruitment This unique data set was derived from a region noted for physical stasis, but the episodic ecological phenomena highlight the importance of rare events. Against a background of intermittent food resources and the low metabolic costs of stasis, understanding the causes of irregular larval supply, dispersal processes, recruitment success and survivorship becomes critical to predicting ecosystem dynamics and resilience in response to increasing environmental change. Our time-series emphasizes that long-term data collection is essential for meaningful forecasts about environmental change in the unique benthic ecosystems of the Antarctic shelf.

During January 2010, an extreme cold event in south Florida caused widespread mortality of common snook, Centropomus undecimalis, a popular sport fish. Interpretation of trends using fishery-independent monitoring data in five south Florida estuaries showed that changes in catch rates of adult snook (>500 mm standard length) varied between no effects postevent to large effects and 4-yr recoveries. The reasons for the variation across estuaries are unknown, but are likely related to differences in estuary geomorphology and habitat availability (e.g., extent of deep rivers and canals) and differences in the proportions of behavior contingents (i.e., segments of the population that use divergent movement tactics) that place snook in different areas of the estuary during winter. Emerging awareness of the presence of behavior contingents, identification of overwintering sites, and improvements of abundance indices in remote nursery habitats should provide a better understanding of population resilience to disturbance events for snook. Given that changes in the frequency of short-lived, severe cold events are currently unknown, the findings and management actions described here for a tropical species living at the edge of its distribution should be useful to scientists forecasting the effects of climate change.",,,,,,"State of Florida Saltwater Fishing License sales, Department of the Interior, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Federal Aid for Sport Fish Restoration [F-43]; RECOVER (REstoration COordination & VERification under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [WSC-1204762]; Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research program [DBI-0620409]","We thank the dedicated field staff that assisted with these expansive sampling efforts across the state of Florida.

Expected effects on the entire ecosystem include a contraction of suitable polar bear habitat into one or few refugia. Such large-scale habitat decline and fragmentation could lead to reduced genetic diversity. Here we compare genetic variability of four vagrant polar bears that reached Iceland with that in recognized subpopulations from across the range, examining 23 autosomal microsatellites, mitochondrial control region sequences and Y-chromosomal markers. The vagrants' genotypes grouped with different genetic clusters and showed similar genetic variability at autosomal microsatellites (expected heterozygosity, allelic richness, and individual heterozygosity) as individuals in recognized subpopulations. Each vagrant carried a different mitochondrial haplotype. A likely route for polar bears to reach Iceland is via Fram Strait, a major gateway for the physical exportation of sea ice from the Arctic basin. Vagrant polar bears on Iceland likely originated from more than one recognized subpopulation, and may have been caught in sea ice export during long-distance movements to the East Greenland area. Although their potentially diverse geographic origins might suggest that these vagrants encompass much higher genetic variability than vagrants or dispersers in other regions, the four Icelandic vagrants encompassed similar genetic variability as any four randomly picked individuals from a single subpopulation or from the entire sample. We suggest that this is a consequence of the low overall genetic variability and weak range-wide genetic structuring of polar bears - few dispersers can represent a large portion of the species' gene pool. As predicted by theory and our demographic simulations, continued gene flow will be necessary to counteract loss of genetic variability in increasingly fragmented Arctic habitats. Similar considerations will be important in the management of other taxa that utilize sea ice habitats.",,,,"Kutschera, Verena E./H-8706-2013; Hagen, Snorre/O-5220-2015; Hailer, Frank/C-9114-2012; Hailer, Frank/Y-3595-2019; Nowak, Carsten/A-4466-2014","Kutschera, Verena E./0000-0002-8930-534X; Hagen, Snorre/0000-0001-8289-7752; Hailer, Frank/0000-0002-2340-1726; Hailer, Frank/0000-0002-2340-1726; Nowak, Carsten/0000-0002-3139-1951; Eiken, Hans Geir/0000-0002-5368-3648; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375","LOEWE Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz; Arthur und Aenne Feindt-Stiftung, Hamburg; Department of Environment, Government of Nunavut","This work was supported by LOEWE Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz, the Arthur und Aenne Feindt-Stiftung, Hamburg, and the Department of Environment, Government of Nunavut.

For migratory species, in particular, it is also essential to consider the extent of spatial synchrony among separate breeding populations in range-wide predictions. We develop a quantitative method to evaluate the accuracy of climate-based ecological predictions and use this approach to assess the extent of spatio-temporal synchrony among distinct regions within the breeding range of a single migratory population. Location We model weekly site-specific summer abundances (1996-2011) of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in the Midwestern USA as a function of climate conditions experienced during a shared spring migration/ breeding phase in Texas and separate summer recruitment periods in Ohio and Illinois. Methods Using negative binomial regression models, we evaluate spatio-temporal synchrony between monarchs in the two states and develop a novel quantitative assessment approach to determine the temporal predictive strength of our model with Bayesian P-values. Results Monarchs breeding in the Midwest exhibit spatio-temporal synchrony in Ohio and Illinois; cooler spring temperatures, average to above average precipitation in Texas and cooler than average summer temperatures are associated with higher population abundances in both states. At least 10 years of data are needed for adequate model predictability of average future counts. Because annual spring weather conditions in Texas primarily drive yearly abundances, as opposed to localized summer effects, year-specific counts are often difficult to predict reliably, specifically when predictive spring conditions are outside the range of typical regional conditions. Main conclusions Our assessment method can be used in similar analyses to more confidently interpret ecological responses to climate change. Our results demonstrate the relative importance of climatic drivers in predicting abundances of a migratory species and the difficulties in producing reliable predictions of animal populations in the face of climate change.",,,,"Saunders, Sarah/M-3238-2019","Saunders, Sarah/0000-0002-2688-9528; Zipkin, Elise/0000-0003-4155-6139; Ries, Leslie/0000-0002-5953-9284",National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DBI-1052875]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1147049],"This work was supported by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the National Science Foundation DBI-1052875.

Its persistence is considered to depend on near-surface permafrost, and thus, forecast warming over the 21st century and consequent degradation of near-surface permafrost is expected to affect the larch forest in Siberia. However, predictions of these effects vary greatly, and many uncertainties remain about land - atmosphere interactions within the ecosystem. We developed an integrated land surface model to analyze how the Siberian larch forest will react to current warming trends. This model analyzed interactions between vegetation dynamics and thermo-hydrology, although it does not consider many processes those are considered to affect productivity response to a changing climate (e.g., nitrogen limitation, waterlogged soil, heat stress, and change in species composition). The model showed that, under climatic conditions predicted under gradual and rapid warming, the annual net primary production of larch increased about 2 and 3 times, respectively, by the end of the 21st century compared with that in the previous century. Soil water content during the larch-growing season showed no obvious trend, even when surface permafrost was allowed to decay and result in subsurface runoff. A sensitivity test showed that the forecast temperature and precipitation trends extended larch leafing days and reduced water shortages during the growing season, thereby increasing productivity. The integrated model also satisfactorily reconstructed latitudinal gradients in permafrost presence, soil moisture, tree leaf area index, and biomass over the entire larch-dominated area in eastern Siberia. Projected changes to ecosystem hydrology and larch productivity at this geographical scale were consistent with those from site-level simulation. This study reduces the uncertainty surrounding the impact of current climate trends on this globally important carbon reservoir, and it demonstrates the need to consider complex ecological processes to make accurate predictions.",,,,"Kobayashi, Hideki/A-9616-2010; Iwahana, Go/I-3500-2018","Kobayashi, Hideki/0000-0001-9319-0621; Iwahana, Go/0000-0003-4628-1074","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [KAKENHI 25281003]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (Grant/Award Number: 'KAKENHI 25281003', 'The Arctic Challenge for Sustainability Project', 'Program for Risk Information on Climate Change').",,,17,18,0,32,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Models for presence-only data are central to predicting species distributions because these represent the only geographical information available for many species. In this paper we introduce extensions to incorporate a variety of types of additional spatially explicit sources of information in Maxent and Poisson point process models. This spatial information comes from the output of other statistical or conceptual models. Innovation Our approach relies on minimizing the relative (or cross) entropy (known as Minxent) between the predicted distribution and a prior distribution. In many scenarios, researchers have some additional information or expectations about the species distribution, such as outputs from previous models. Here, we show how to use this information to improve predictions of both niche models and spatial distributions, depending on what types of spatially explicit prior information is available and how it is incorporated in the model. Main conclusions We illustrate applications of Minxent that include models for sampling bias, explicitly incorporating dispersal/other ecological processes, combining native and invasive range data, incorporating expert maps, and borrowing strength across taxonomic relatives. These applications focus on addressing biological scenarios where range modelling is extremely challenging - non-equilibrium species distributions and rare and narrowly distributed species - due to data limitations. When data are limited, we are typically forced to make informal assumptions or lean on predictions of other models in order to obtain useful predictions; our applications of Minxent provide a formal way of describing these assumptions and connections to other models.",,,,,"Aiello-Lammens, Matthew/0000-0002-6180-5959","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1046328, 1137366, EAPSI-0812970]; USDA-NRIUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2008-35615-19014]","C.M. acknowledges funding from NSF grant 1046328 and NSF grant 1137366.

This applies to the Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus, the most endangered European seabird, whose time to extinction was estimated at only 40years a decade ago. Since the previous assessment, new data and more sophisticated demographic modelling have become available, and new fishing policies from the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy, CFP) will apply, posing different scenarios for the viability of the species. Thus, there is both an urgent need and an opportunity for a more reliable update of the conservation status of the species. Demographic data were collected between 1985 and 2014 at one of the world's largest colonies. Most demographic parameters were estimated using multievent capture-recapture modelling. Some parameters, such as bycatch rate, immature individual survival and recruitment, were estimated for the first time. We incorporated estimates into stochastic population models to forecast time to extinction and assess the viability under different management scenarios, accounting for upcoming fishing policies. Adult survival was much lower than expected (0809, SE: 0013) and largely influenced by bycatch, which accounted for a minimum of 0455 (SE: 0230) of total mortality. Breeding success was positively correlated with discard availability. Recruitment started at low rates in 3-year-old birds (0030, SE: 00455), increasing in following age classes and was almost complete at 6years. Under the present scenario, we predict a time to extinction of 61years (95% CI: 55-69).Synthesis and applications. Population projections suggest that the actual impact of fisheries on Balearic shearwaters is unsustainable and the imminent discard ban under the new Common Fisheries Policy may accelerate the declining trend. This study demonstrates that reducing the bycatch rates of fisheries is an unavoidable and urgent conservation measure for avoiding the extinction of the species. We also advise setting up demographic long-term studies, to allow researchers to diagnose, with reliability, the effectiveness of management actions. These actions will also benefit many other marine top-predator species affected by this anthropogenic impact.",,,,"Alvarez, David/B-7472-2012","Alvarez, David/0000-0002-2190-7950; Meier, Rhiannon/0000-0002-7411-6191","FEDER programme (Balearic Government); Spanish Ministries of Economy and Competitiveness and Agriculture, Food and Environment [CGL2013-42203-R]; EU programme (MINOUW project); Fundacion Biodiversidad; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [noc010011]","We thank everybody involved in the fieldwork over the years.

Studies quantifying these individual-scale parameters and documenting their source of variation in wild hosts are fundamental for predicting disease dynamics. Such studies do not exist for the influenza A virus (IAV), despite its strong impact on the global economy and public health. Using capture-recaptures of 3500 individual mallards Anas platyrhynchos during seven migration seasons at a stopover site in southern Sweden, we provide the first empirical description of the individual-based mechanisms of IAV dynamics in a wild reservoir host. For most years, prevalence and risk of IAV infection peaked at a single time during the autumn migration season, but the timing, shape and intensity of the infection curve showed strong annual heterogeneity. In contrast, the seasonal pattern of recovery rate only varied in intensity across years. Adults and juveniles displayed similar seasonal patterns of infection and recovery each year. However, compared to adults, juveniles experienced twice the risk of becoming infected, whereas recovery rates were similar across age categories. Finally, we did not find evidence that infection influenced the timing of emigration.Synthesis and applications. Our study provides robust empirical estimates of epidemiological parameters for predicting influenza A virus (IAV) dynamics. However, the strong annual variation in infection curves makes forecasting difficult. Prevalence data can provide reliable surveillance indicators as long as they catch the variation in infection risk. However, individual-based monitoring of infection is required to verify this assumption in areas where surveillance occurs. In this context, monitoring of captive sentinel birds kept in close contact with wild birds is useful. The fact that infection does not impact the timing of migration underpins the potential for mallards to spread viruses rapidly over large geographical scales. Hence, we strongly encourage IAV surveillance with a multistate capture-recapture approach along the entire migratory flyway of mallards.",,,,"Gaidet, Niccolas/H-8122-2013; Waldenstrom, Jonas/E-4460-2013","Waldenstrom, Jonas/0000-0002-1152-4235; Olsen, Bjorn/0000-0002-4646-691X","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [V-124-01, V-98-04]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [2008-58, 2010-3067, 2011-48]; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2007-297, 2009-1220]; Sparbanksstiftelsen Kronan; Swedish Board of Agriculture; EU NP6-funded New Flubird project","This study was supported by grants from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (V-124-01 and V-98-04), the Swedish Research Council (2008-58, 2010-3067, 2011-48), the Swedish Research Council Formas (2007-297, 2009-1220) and the Sparbanksstiftelsen Kronan.

What climatic or water balance variables and antecedent windows of time associated with these variables best relate to the condition of vegetation? Can we develop credible near-term forecasts from climate data that can be used to prepare for future climate change effects on vegetation? Location: Semi-arid grasslands in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA. Methods: We built vegetation response models by relating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS imagery in Mar-Nov 2000-2013 to antecedent climate and water balance variables preceding the monthly NDVI observations. We compared how climate and water balance variables explained vegetation greenness and then used a multi-model ensemble of climate and water balance models to forecast monthly NDVI for three holdout years. Results: Water balance variables explained vegetation greenness to a greater degree than climate variables for most growing season months. Seasonally important variables included measures of antecedent water input and storage in spring, switching to indicators of drought, input or use in summer, followed by antecedent moisture availability in autumn. In spite of similar climates, there was evidence the grazed grassland showed a response to drying conditions 1 mo sooner than the ungrazed grassland. Lead times were generally short early in the growing season and antecedent window durations increased from 3 mo early in the growing season to 1 yr or more as the growing season progressed. Forecast accuracy for three holdout years using a multi-model ensemble of climate and water balance variables outperformed forecasts made with a naive NDVI climatology. Conclusions: We determined the influence of climate and water balance on vegetation at a fine temporal scale, which presents an opportunity to forecast vegetation response with short lead times. This understanding was obtained through high-frequency vegetation monitoring using remote sensing, which reduces the costs and time necessary for field measurements and can lead to more rapid detection of vegetation changes that could help managers take appropriate actions.",,,,,"Thoma, David/0000-0002-8001-1804",National Park Service; U.S. Geological Survey Status and Trends Program; National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,"This project was supported by funding from the National Park Service, the U.S. Geological Survey Status and Trends Program and the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center.

Fire fragments the shrub steppe and reduces its capacity to provide forage for livestock and wildlife and habitat critical to sagebrush obligates. Of particular interest is the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an obligate whose populations have declined so severely due, in part, to increases in cheatgrass and fires that it was considered for inclusion as an endangered species. Remote sensing technologies and satellite archives help scientists monitor terrestrial vegetation globally, including cheatgrass in the Northern Great Basin. Along with geospatial analysis and advanced spatial modeling, these data and technologies can identify areas susceptible to increased cheatgrass cover and compare these with greater sage grouse priority areas for conservation (PAC). Future climate models forecast a warmer and wetter climate for the Northern Great Basin, which likely will force changing cheatgrass dynamics. Therefore, we examine potential climate-caused changes to cheatgrass. Our results indicate that future cheatgrass percent cover will remain stable over more than 80% of the study area when compared with recent estimates, and higher overall cheatgrass cover will occur with slightly more spatial variability. The land area projected to increase or decrease in cheatgrass cover equals 18% and 1%, respectively, making an increase in fire disturbances in greater sage grouse habitat likely. Relative susceptibility measures, created by integrating cheatgrass percent cover and temporal standard deviation datasets, show that potential increases in future cheatgrass cover match future projections. This discovery indicates that some greater sage grouse PACs for conservation could be at heightened risk of fire disturbance. Multiple factors will affect future cheatgrass cover including changes in precipitation timing and totals and increases in freeze-thaw cycles. Understanding these effects can help direct land management, guide scientific research, and influence policy. (C) 2016 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We used remotely sensed fire data to assess if the Flint Hills-a landscape of tallgrass prairie in the Central Great Plains, United States-is operating beyond fire frequency thresholds. Long-term fire experiments and observational evidence suggests that applying prescribed fire at return intervals >3 yr can lead to transitions from grassland to shrubland. Fire return intervals > 10 yr and complete fire suppression, in particular, can result in transitions to woodlands over 30-50 yr. Once shrublands and woodlands are established, restoration back to grassland is difficult with prescribed fires. We applied these fire frequency cutoffs to remotely sensed fire data from 2000 to 2010 in the Flint Hills, identifying the extent of tallgrass prairie susceptible to shrub and tree expansion. We found that 56% (15 620 km(2)) of grasslands in this region are burned less than every 3 yr and are therefore susceptible to conversion to shrub or tree dominance. The potential effects of this large-scale shift are greater risk for evergreen (Juniperus virginiana) woodland fires, reduced grazing potential, and increased abundance of woodland adapted species at the expense of the native grassland biota. Of the 12 127-km(2) area likely to remain grassland, 43% is burned approximately annually, contributing to vegetative homogenization and potential air-quality issues. While this synthesis forecasts a precarious future for tallgrass prairie conservation and their ecosystem services, increases in shrub or tree dominances are usually reversible until fire frequency has been reduced for more than 20 yr. This delay leaves a small window of opportunity to return fire to the landscape and avoid large-scale transformation of tallgrass prairie. (C) 2016 The Society for Range Management.

The procedure employed to predict pollution normally requires historical data samples for a large number of points in time particularly weather forecast data, actual weather data and pollution data. Likewise, it typically involves using numerous features related to atmospheric conditions. Consequently the analysis of such datasets to generate accurate forecasts becomes very cumbersome task. The paper examines a variety of unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods aimed at obtaining compact yet informative set of features. As an alternative, approach using fractional distances for data analysis tasks is being considered as well. Both strategies were evaluated on real-world data obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in Katowice (Poland), with extended Air Pollution Forecast Model (e-APFM) being used as underlying prediction tool. It was found that employing fractional distance as a dissimilarity measure ensures the best accuracy of forecasting. Satisfactory results can be also obtained with Isomap, Landmark Isomap and Factor Analysis as dimensionality reduction techniques. These methods can be also used to formulate universal mapping, ready-to-use for data gathered at different geographical areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although bark beetles are indigenous to North American forests, climate change has facilitated the beetle's expansion into previously unsuitable habitats. We used three correlative niche models (maximum entropy [MaxEnt], boosted regression trees, and generalized linear models) to estimate (1) the current potential distribution of the beetle in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, (2) how this distribution has changed since historical outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, and (3) how the distribution may be expected to change under future climate scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the temporal transferability of the niche models by forecasting historical models and testing the model predictions using temporally independent outbreak data from the current outbreak. Our results indicated that there has been a significant expansion of climatically suitable habitat over the past 50 yr and that much of this expansion corresponds with an upward shift in elevation across the study area. Furthermore, our models indicated that drought was a more prominent driver of current outbreak than temperature, which suggests a change in the climatic signature between historical and current outbreaks. Projections under future conditions suggest that there will be a large reduction in climatically suitable habitat for the beetle and that high-elevation forests will continue to become more susceptible to outbreak. While all three models generated reasonable predictions, the generalized linear model correctly predicted a higher percentage of current outbreak localities when trained on historical data. Our findings suggest that researchers aiming to reduce omission error in estimates of future species responses may have greater predictive success with simpler, generalized models.",,,,,,Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory; Warner College of Natural Resources at Colorado State University; Neil B.

Most forecasts of climate change refugia for species are based on correlative species distribution models (SDMs) using long-term climate averages, projected to future climate scenarios. Limitations of such methods include the need to extrapolate into novel environments and uncertainty regarding the extent to which proximate variables included in the model capture processes driving distribution limits (and thus can be assumed to provide reliable predictions under new conditions). These limitations are well documented; however, their impact on the quality of climate refugia predictions is difficult to quantify. Here, we develop a detailed bioenergetics model for the koala. It indicates that range limits are driven by heat-induced water stress, with the timing of rainfall and heat waves limiting the koala in the warmer parts of its range. We compare refugia predictions from the bioenergetics model with predictions from a suite of competing correlative SDMs under a range of future climate scenarios. SDMs were fitted using combinations of long-term climate and weather extremes variables, to test how well each set of predictions captures the knowledge embedded in the bioenergetics model. Correlative models produced broadly similar predictions to the bioenergetics model across much of the species' current range - with SDMs that included weather extremes showing highest congruence. However, predictions in some regions diverged significantly when projecting to future climates due to the breakdown in correlation between climate variables. We provide unique insight into the mechanisms driving koala distribution and illustrate the importance of subtle relationships between the timing of weather events, particularly rain relative to hot-spells, in driving species-climate relationships and distributions. By unpacking the mechanisms captured by correlative SDMs, we can increase our certainty in forecasts of climate change impacts on species.",,,,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Briscoe, Natalie/0000-0003-0049-8956; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950",NERP Environmental Decisions Hub; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110102813]; ARCAustralian Research Council [FT100100819],"Data custodians for additional koala records: Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries, Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, and NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.

The capacity to forecast how species respond to such press perturbations is limited by our imprecise knowledge of pairwise species interaction strengths and the many direct and indirect pathways along which perturbations can propagate between species. Network complexity (size and connectance) has thereby been seen to limit the predictability of ecological systems. Here we demonstrate a counteracting mechanism in which the influence of indirect effects declines with increasing network complexity when species interactions are governed by universal allometric constraints. With these constraints, network size and connectance interact to produce a skewed distribution of interaction strengths whose skew becomes more pronounced with increasing complexity. Together, the increased prevalence of weak interactions and the increased relative strength and rarity of strong interactions in complex networks limit disturbance propagation and preserve the qualitative predictability of net effects even when pairwise interaction strengths exhibit substantial variation or uncertainty.",,,,"Novak, Mark/E-2194-2012","Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253",Comparative Analysis of Marine Ecosystem Organization (CAMEO) program; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); US National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [OCE-1041454]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353827],"This research was supported by the Comparative Analysis of Marine Ecosystem Organization (CAMEO) program, jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (OCE-1041454).

A key barrier in this has been the underappreciation of grain-dependent diversity responses and the role that beta-diversity (variation in community composition across space) plays in this. Decisions about the most effective spatial arrangement of conservation set-aside, for example high conservation value areas, have also neglected beta-diversity, despite its role in determining the complementarity of sites. We examined local-scale mammalian species richness and beta-diversity across old-growth forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantations in Borneo, using intensive camera- and live-trapping. For the first time, we were able to investigate diversity responses, as well as beta-diversity, at multiple spatial grains, and across the whole terrestrial mammal community (large and small mammals); beta-diversity was quantified by comparing observed beta-diversity with that obtained under a null model, in order to control for sampling effects, and we refer to this as the beta-diversity signal. Community responses to land use were grain dependent, with large mammals showing reduced richness in logged forest compared to old-growth forest at the grain of individual sampling points, but no change at the overall land-use level. Responses varied with species group, however, with small mammals increasing in richness at all grains in logged forest compared to old-growth forest. Both species groups were significantly depauperate in oil palm. Large mammal communities in old-growth forest became more heterogeneous at coarser spatial grains and small mammal communities became more homogeneous, while this pattern was reversed in logged forest. Both groups, however, showed a significant beta-diversity signal at the finest grain in logged forest, likely due to logging-induced environmental heterogeneity. The beta-diversity signal in oil palm was weak, but heterogeneity at the coarsest spatial grain was still evident, likely due to variation in landscape forest cover. Our findings suggest that the most effective spatial arrangement of set-aside will involve trade-offs between conserving large and small mammals. Greater consideration in the conservation and management of tropical landscapes needs to be given to beta-diversity at a range of spatial grains.",,,,"Rowcliffe, Marcus/G-3713-2018","Rowcliffe, Marcus/0000-0002-4286-6887; Wearn, Oliver/0000-0001-8258-3534",Royal Society South East Asia Rainforest Research ProgrammeRoyal Society of London; Sime Darby Foundation,"We are grateful to Yayasan Sabah, Benta Wawasan, Sabah Softwoods, the Sabah Forestry Department, and the Maliau Basin Management Committee for allowing access to field sites.

The nonnative succulent plant Kalanchoe pinnata, reported as invasive in some countries, is widespread in remnants of seasonally dry tropical forest on a volcanic outcrop with high conservation value in east-central Mexico where we assessed its mating system and demographic growth and identified management strategies. To understand its local mating system, we conducted hand-pollination treatments, germination, and survival experiments. Based on the experimental data, we constructed a life-stage population matrix, identified the key traits for population growth, weighted the contributions of vegetative and sexual reproduction, and evaluated management scenarios. Hand-pollination treatments had slight effects on fruit and seed setting, as well as on germination. With natural pollination treatment, the successful germination of seeds from only 2/39 fruit suggests occasional effective natural cross-pollination. The ratios of the metrics for self-and cross-pollinated flowers suggest that K. pinnata is partially self-compatible. Most of the pollinated flowers developed into fruit, but the seed germination and seedling survival rates were low. Thus, vegetative propagation and juvenile survival are the main drivers of population growth. Simulations of a virtual K. pinnata population suggest that an intense and sustained weeding campaign will reduce the population within at least 10 years. Synthesis and applications. The study population is partially self-compatible, but sexual reproduction by K. pinnata is limited at the study site, and population growth is supported by vegetative propagation and juvenile survival.

To predict the way in which these might change, we need process-based predictive ecological models, but these are necessarily very data intensive. We tested the ability of existing datasets to provide the parameters necessary to instantiate a well-used forest model (SORTIE) for a well-studied woodland (Wytham Woods). Only five of SORTIE's 16 equations describing different aspects of the life history and behavior of individual trees could be parameterized without additional data collection. One age class - seedlings - was completely missed as they are shorter than the height at which Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) is measured. The mensuration of trees has changed little in the last 400years (focussing almost exclusively on DBH) despite major changes in the nature of the source of value obtained from trees over this time. This results in there being insufficient data to parameterize process-based models in order to meet the societal demand for ecological prediction. We do not advocate ceasing the measurement of DBH, but we do recommend that those concerned with tree mensuration consider whether additional measures of trees could be added to their data collection protocols.

A number of ecological models have been proposed over the last decades to develop these biodiversity scenarios. Novel modelling approaches with strong theoretical foundation now offer the possibility to integrate key ecological and evolutionary processes that shape species distribution and community structure. Although biodiversity is affected by multiple threats, most studies addressing the effects of future environmental changes on biodiversity focus on a single threat only. We examined the studies published during the last 25years that developed scenarios to predict future biodiversity changes based on climate, land-use and land-cover change projections. We found that biodiversity scenarios mostly focus on the future impacts of climate change and largely neglect changes in land use and land cover. The emphasis on climate change impacts has increased over time and has now reached a maximum. Yet, the direct destruction and degradation of habitats through land-use and land-cover changes are among the most significant and immediate threats to biodiversity. We argue that the current state of integration between ecological and land system sciences is leading to biased estimation of actual risks and therefore constrains the implementation of forward-looking policy responses to biodiversity decline. We suggest research directions at the crossroads between ecological and environmental sciences to face the challenge of developing interoperable and plausible projections of future environmental changes and to anticipate the full range of their potential impacts on biodiversity. An intergovernmental platform is needed to stimulate such collaborative research efforts and to emphasize the societal and political relevance of taking up this challenge.",,,,"Henle, Klaus/I-6837-2013; Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009; Regos, Adrian/M-5207-2014; Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Titeux, Nicolas/G-4723-2016; Mihoub, Jb/B-7708-2015; Titeux, Nicolas/AAD-4439-2019; Cramer, Wolfgang/B-8221-2008; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Henle, Klaus/0000-0002-6647-5362; Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; Regos, Adrian/0000-0003-1983-936X; Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417; Mihoub, Jb/0000-0002-5354-850X; Titeux, Nicolas/0000-0002-7719-7417; Cramer, Wolfgang/0000-0002-9205-5812; Geijzendorffer, Ilse R./0000-0002-8471-7695; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104","EU (European Commission)European Commission Joint Research CentreEuropean Union (EU) [308454]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [235175, 311819]; Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2014-59742]; French Government through the A*MIDEX projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0061, ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]","N.T., K.H., J.B.M., I.R.G., W.C. and L.B. acknowledge support from the EU BON project (no. 308454, FP7-ENV-2012, European Commission, Hoffmann et al., 2014).

Global change is rapidly altering environmental conditions, but, with the exception of coral microalgae interactions, we know little of how this will affect symbiotic relationships. We here test how the effects of ocean acidification, from rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions, may alter symbiotic interactions between juvenile fish and their jellyfish hosts. Fishes treated with elevated seawater CO2 concentrations, as forecast for the end of the century on a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenario, were negatively affected in their behaviour. The total time that fish (yellowtail scad) spent close to their jellyfish host in a choice arena where they could see and smell their host was approximately three times shorter under future compared with ambient CO2 conditions. Likewise, the mean number of attempts to associate with jellyfish was almost three times lower in CO2-treated compared with control fish, while only 63% (high CO2) versus 86% (control) of all individuals tested initiated an association at all. By contrast, none of three fish species tested were attracted solely to jellyfish olfactory cues under present-day CO2 conditions, suggesting that the altered fish jellyfish association is not driven by negative effects of ocean acidification on olfaction. Because shelter is not widely available in the open water column and larvae of many (and often commercially important) pelagic species associate with jellyfish for protection against predators, modification of the fish jellyfish symbiosis might lead to higher mortality and alter species population dynamics, and potentially have flow-on effects for their fisheries.",,,,"Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011; Pitt, Kylie A/N-7421-2014","Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940; Pitt, Kylie A/0000-0002-2292-2052",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT120100183],This study was supported by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (grant no.

Seasonal variation in environmental conditions can have an indirect effect on subsequent reproduction, which, given the longevity and single-brooding of seabirds, may affect population dynamics. Our study focuses on linking the effect of oceanographic conditions (from 1991 to 2013) to the fecundity and consequently population growth rate of the Mediterranean subspecies of the European storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus melitensis. In this study, we examined 23 yr of >5400 capture-mark-recaptures (CMR) and modelled the probability of skipping reproduction as a function of oceanographic variables using CMR models. We demonstrate that a decrease in sea surface temperature in the pre-breeding period negatively influences skipping propensity, and therefore hypothesize that this behaviour would have significant influence on population abundance over time. For this reason, we analysed population growth as a function of skipping probability as affected by oceanographic conditions. We used stochastic demographic models to forecast the fate of the population, and evaluated contrasted environmental condition scenarios. As a result, we found that a decrease in frequency of cold winter events would probably reduce skipping propensity, with a positive effect on the population as a whole.",,,,"Albores-Barajas, Yuri V/C-5042-2009; Gimenez, Olivier/G-4281-2010; Soldatini, Cecilia/F-2950-2011","Albores-Barajas, Yuri V/0000-0002-9255-4865; Soldatini, Cecilia/0000-0002-8112-3162",project CICESE [691111],"We are particularly grateful to David Koons for making available the codes for the analysis of environmental stochasticity, and for his comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.",,,,,"Benavides, Julio/0000-0002-3920-9165; Streicker, Daniel/0000-0001-7475-2705",Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust [102507/Z/13/Z]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London [102507/Z/13/Z],"D.S. was supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship, jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society (grant no: 102507/Z/13/Z).",,,15,16,1,51,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

However, no simulation models are available to support the analysis of the impact of environmental conditions and management practices on hazelnut production. This paper presents two modelling solutions to simulate hazelnut tree growth and development under potential and water-limiting conditions, partly based on generic approaches used in tree modelling and on new modules specifically developed to address hazelnut tree peculiarities. The two solutions differed in the simulation of the photosynthetic rate, in one case reproduced using a Farquhar-type model (gross photosynthesis), whereas a radiation use efficiency approach (net photosynthesis) was used in the other. The coherence of simulation outputs at leaf, organ and plant level and the models responsiveness to weather conditions was verified and discussed with literature data, and the performances of the modelling solutions were evaluated using experimental data collected between 2002 and 2013 growing seasons in Piedmont region (northern Italy). Results highlighted the reliability of both the solutions in reproducing phenological development (mean relative root mean squared error, RRMSE = 8.61%), as well as the time trend of specific leaf area (RRMSE = 26.32%) and leaf area index (RRMSE = 18.46%). Also, the simulation of the temporal dynamics of soil water content and temperature along the soil profile led to outputs very close to observations (RRMSE = 14.02% and 10.32%, respectively). The solution based on gross photosynthesis resulted slightly more accurate in reproducing the year-to-year fluctuation in yields (RRMSE = 25.03%) compared to the one based on net photosynthesis (RRMSE = 30.40%). These results proved the suitability of these modelling solutions to be used as simulation engines within a variety of applications, ranging from decision support systems for the management of the orchard to complex yield forecasting systems.

Four presence-absence modelling algorithms (RF, MARS, GLM, GBM) were merged within the ensemble forecasting platform 'biomod2'. The present spatial distribution (representing 2009) was modelled based on statistical relationships between species presences, true species absences and 7 high-resolution (5 m) environmental grids. The past spatial distribution (representing the 1970s) was then hindcast in response to climate change-induced (1) sea-level rise, (2) water temperature increase and (3) seagrass recovery due to de-eutrophication. The past distribution scenario was evaluated using independent historical macrofauna data from the 1970s. Present ensemble prediction maps accurately captured the potential ecological niches of the modelled species throughout Jade Bay (i.e. good to excellent true skill statistic [TSS] and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] evaluation measures). The predicted present macrofauna distribution correlated most significantly with hydrodynamic conditions (submergence time, shear stress) and sediment characteristics (mud content). The past distribution scenario revealed significant changes in small-scale spatial distribution patterns of the characteristic modelled species (1970s to 2009) and showed a very good match with historical macrofauna data. Climate change-induced sea-level rise and its local implications for Jade Bay (changes in topo graphy, tidal range and submergence time), and water temperature increase explained the potential macrofauna distribution shifts over the last 4 decades.",,,,"Brumsack, Hans-Jurgen/O-7942-2016; Wolff, Joerg-Olaf/F-8248-2010","Brumsack, Hans-Jurgen/0000-0002-5549-5018; Wolff, Joerg-Olaf/0000-0001-7037-7688",DFG ('German Research Foundation') within the INTERCOAST ('Integrated Coastal Zone and Shelf-Sea Research') graduate programme,"We thank Hermann Michaelis and the NLWKN for providing the 1970s macrofauna data.

Arctic cod demonstrated a cold-water, stenothermic response in that there was relatively high growth at 0 A degrees C (0.73 % day(-1)), near-maximal growth at 5 A degrees C (1.35 % day(-1)) and negative impacts on activity, growth and survival at 16 A degrees C. In contrast, saffron cod demonstrated a warmer-water, eurythermic response, and temperature had a positive effect on growth and condition beyond 16 A degrees C. However, despite these distinct thermal responses, walleye pollock and Pacific cod grew 2-3 times faster than Arctic gadids across a relatively broad temperature range above 5 A degrees C. These results, coupled with possible northward expansion by both Pacific cod and walleye pollock, suggest Arctic cod are highly vulnerable to continued climate change in the Arctic, especially in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas where temperatures already exceed 14 A degrees C in the summer growth period.",,,,,,North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) [R1228]; NOAA-AFSC,"We thank C.

Using acoustic transmitters and fixed receiver arrays across four years (2010-2013), we tracked the migration of >1850 wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts from Chilko Lake, British Columbia, to the coastal Pacific Ocean (>1000 km distance). Cumulative survival to the ocean ranged 3-10% among years, although this may be slightly underestimated due to technical limitations at the final receiver array. Distinct spatial patterns in both behavior and survival were observed through all years. In small, clear, upper-river reaches, downstream migration largely occurred at night at speeds up to 50 km/d and coincided with poor survival. Among years, only 57-78% of smolts survived the first 80 km. Parallel laboratory experiments revealed excellent short-term survival and unhindered swimming performance of dummy-tagged smolts, suggesting that predators rather than tagging effects were responsible for the initial high mortality of acoustic-tagged smolts. Migration speeds increased in the Fraser River mainstem (similar to 220 km/d in some years), diel movement patterns ceased, and smolt survival generally exceeded 90% in this segment. Marine movement rates and survival were variable across years, with among-year segment-specific survival being the most variable and lowest (19-61%) during the final (and longest, 240 km) marine migration segment. Osmoregulatory preparedness was not expected to influence marine survival, as smolts could maintain normal levels of plasma chloride when experimentally exposed to saltwater (30 ppt) immediately upon commencing their migration from Chilko Lake. Transportation of smolts downstream generally increased survival to the farthest marine array. The act of tagging may have affected smolts in the marine environment in some years as dummy-tagged fish had poorer survival than control fish when transitioned to saltwater in laboratory-based experiments. Current fisheries models for forecasting the number of adult sockeye returning to spawn have been inaccurate in recent years and generally do not incorporate juvenile or smolt survival information. Our results highlight significant potential for early migration conditions to influence adult recruitment.",,,,"Furey, Nathan/J-4862-2012; Clark, Timothy Darren/K-7129-2012","Furey, Nathan/0000-0002-8584-7889; Clark, Timothy Darren/0000-0001-8738-3347",Canada Ocean Tracking Network; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs; Alfred P.

Another potential source of model error is the assumption that species are ecologically uniform in their climatic tolerances across their range. Typically, SDMs treat a species as a single entity, although populations of many species differ due to local adaptation or other genetic differentiation. Not taking local adaptation into account may lead to incorrect range prediction and therefore misplaced conservation efforts. A constraint is that we often do not know the degree to which populations are locally adapted. Lacking experimental evidence, we still can evaluate niche differentiation within a species' range to promote better conservation decisions. We explore possible conservation implications of making type I or type II errors in this context. For each of two species, we construct three separate MaxEnt models, one considering the species as a single population and two of disjunct populations. Principal component analyses and response curves indicate different climate characteristics in the current environments of the populations. Model projections into future climates indicate minimal overlap between areas predicted to be climatically suitable by the whole species vs. population-based models. We present a workflow for addressing uncertainty surrounding local adaptation in SDM application and illustrate the value of conducting population-based models to compare with whole-species models.

With ongoing changes in the environment, some dispersal barriers will likely disappear while new ones will appear, and it is crucial to understand these dynamics to forecast species' distributions and adaptive potential. Here we review recent literature on the ecological and evolutionary aspects of dispersal to highlight key dynamics of dispersal barriers in the face of global change. After defining dispersal barriers, we explain that a better understanding of their dynamics requires identifying the barrier types that are most susceptible to change and predicting species' responses. This knowledge is a prerequisite for designing management strategies to increase or reduce connectivity, and maintain adaptive potential. Our intent is to motivate researchers to explicitly consider dispersal barriers in order to better forecast the dynamics of species and ecosystems subject to global change.",,,,"Cote, Julien/B-7809-2011; Tesson, Sylvie VM/D-9018-2015; Petit, Eric J/C-1091-2011; Edelaar, Pim/P-5650-2014; Green, Andy J/A-5189-2008; Londahl, Jakob/B-8217-2014","Cote, Julien/0000-0002-4453-5969; Tesson, Sylvie VM/0000-0002-0751-6953; Petit, Eric J/0000-0001-5058-5826; Edelaar, Pim/0000-0003-4649-6366; Green, Andy J/0000-0002-1268-4951; Londahl, Jakob/0000-0001-9379-592X; Dudaniec, Rachael/0000-0002-1854-6808",BECC (Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate) research environment; Centre for Animal Movement Research (CAnMove),"The ideas behind this paper stemmed from a symposium held at Lund University, Sweden, in January 2013, supported by the BECC (Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate) research environment and the Centre for Animal Movement Research (CAnMove).

One method of establishing MVP is population viability analysis, a modeling technique that simulates population trajectories and forecasts extinction risk based on a series of biological, environmental, and management assumptions. Such models also help identify key uncertainties that have a large influence on extinction risk. We used stochastic count-based simulation models to explore extinction risk, MVP, and the possible benefits of alternative management strategies in populations of Roanoke logperch Percina rex, an endangered stream fish. Estimates of extinction risk were sensitive to the assumed population growth rate and model type, carrying capacity, and catastrophe regime (frequency and severity of anthropogenic fish kills), whereas demographic augmentation did little to reduce extinction risk. Under density-dependent growth, the estimated MVP for Roanoke logperch ranged from 200 to 4200 individuals, depending on the assumed severity of catastrophes. Thus, depending on the MVP threshold, anywhere from two to all five of the logperch populations we assessed were projected to be viable. Despite this uncertainty, these results help identify populations with the greatest relative extinction risk, as well as management strategies that might reduce this risk the most, such as increasing carrying capacity and reducing fish kills. Better estimates of population growth parameters and catastrophe regimes would facilitate the refinement of MVP and extinction-risk estimates, and they should be a high priority for future research on Roanoke logperch and other imperiled stream-fish species.",,,,"Roberts, James/AAI-3283-2020","Roberts, James/0000-0002-2671-3207","U.S. Geological Survey, Virginia Polytechnic Institute; State University, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries; Wildlife Management Institute","We thank K.

Despite many studies cautioning against such generalizations for conservation, wildlife management for slow-growing populations still often focuses on perturbing survival without careful evaluation as to whether those changes are likely or feasible. Here, we evaluate the relative importance of reproduction and survival for the conservation of two bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops cf aduncus) populations: a large, apparently stable population and a smaller one that is forecast to decline. We also assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of wildlife management objectives aimed at boosting either reproduction or survival. Consistent with other analytically based elasticity studies, survival had the greatest effect on population trajectories when altering vital rates by equal proportions. However, the findings of our alternative analytical approaches are in stark contrast to commonly used proportional sensitivity analyses and suggest that reproduction is considerably more important. We show that 1 in the stable population reproductive output is higher, and adult survival is lower; 2 the difference in viability between the two populations is due to the difference in reproduction; 3 reproductive rates are variable, whereas survival rates are relatively constant over time; 4 perturbations on the basis of observed, temporal variation indicate that population dynamics are much more influenced by reproduction than by adult survival; 5 for the apparently declining population, raising reproductive rates would be an effective and feasible tool to reverse the forecast population decline; increasing survival would be ineffective. Our findings highlight the importance of reproduction - even in slow-growing populations - and the need to assess the effect of natural variation in vital rates on population viability. We echo others in cautioning against generalizations based on life-history traits and recommend that population modeling for conservation should also take into account the magnitude of vital rate changes that could be attained under alternative management scenarios.",,,,"Manlik, Oliver/W-3283-2018; Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020; Krutzen, Michael C/D-9550-2011; Bejder, Lars/D-1772-2017; Mann, Janet/L-2311-2019; Sherwin, William B B/C-3432-2008","Manlik, Oliver/0000-0002-0924-3768; Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Bejder, Lars/0000-0001-8138-8606; Sherwin, William B B/0000-0002-1578-8473; Krutzen, Michael/0000-0003-1055-5299; Mann, Janet/0000-0003-0664-175X",NSF (USA)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; WV Scott Foundation; PADI Foundation; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Shark Bay Shire,"The data were accumulated over many studies whose funding included NSF (USA), NSERC Canada, National Geographic Society, WV Scott Foundation, PADI Foundation, Australian Research Council, Shark Bay Shire, and in-kind from Monkey Mia Resort, tour operators, the Shark Bay and Bunbury communities, including volunteer research assistants and the Australian Coast Radio Monitors WA Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine, under lab conditions, the effect of low Ca concentrations on survival, growth and Ca content of a freshwater crayfish, Orconectes virilis, originating in a region experiencing Ca decline. We found that survival of juvenile O. virilis was significantly reduced at 0.5-0.9mgL(-1), which is among the lowest requirement reported for a freshwater crayfish. Neither growth nor whole-body Ca content were related to Ca concentration. Based on these findings, the acute tolerance of O. virilis to low Ca may allow the species to persist under forecast concentrations of lakes in regions experiencing Ca decline; however, most lakes are experiencing stress from multiple environmental agents which could influence the impact of Ca on mortality and potentially other life history attributes.",,,,"Jackson, Donald/J-6441-2013","Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank Simona Tencaliuc, Jesse Elders and Vern Lewis for their hard work in the lab maintaining and monitoring the experiments.

Nonetheless, in practice, species distribution modelling assumes that plant distributions represent a reasonable approximation of their environmental tolerance. For ecological forecasting, projections of habitat loss due to climate change assume that many species will be unable to tolerate climate conditions outside of those found within their current distributional ranges. We aim to test how well occurrences in the native range approximate the climatic conditions in which plant species can survive. Location Continental USA. Methods We compared the climatic conditions between occurrences in the US native versus US non-native ranges using 144 non-invasive plant species. We quantified differences in January minimum temperature, July maximum temperature and annual precipitation as indicators of climatic tolerance. We also compared modelled potential distributions throughout the US based on native and total ranges to test how expanded climatic tolerance translates into predicted geographical range. Results Most species (86%) had non-native occurrences in climates outside those described by their native distributions. For the 80 species with lower minimum temperatures at non-native occurrences, the median expansion of minimum temperature tolerance was -2.9 degrees C. Similarly, for the 90 species with lower precipitation at non-native occurrences, the median expansion of minimum annual precipitation was -23 cm. Broader climatic conditions at non-native occurrences expanded the modelled potential geographical range by a median of 35%, with smaller range species showing larger expansions of potential geographical range. Main conclusions Our results show that plants' native ranges strongly underestimate climatic tolerance, leading species distribution models to underpredict potential range. The climatic tolerance of species with narrow native ranges appears most prone to underestimation. These findings suggest that many plants will be able to persist in situ with climate change for far longer than projected by species distribution models.",,,,"Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008","Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station; Department of Environmental Conservation [MAS00016, MAS00410]","We thank C.

Reduction in landscape connectivity due changes in land use or development is expected to act synergistically with alterations to habitat mosaic configuration arising from climate change. We illustrate a multiscale connectivity framework to aid habitat conservation prioritization in the context of changing land use and climate. Our approach, which builds upon the strengths of multiple landscape connectivity methods, including graph theory, circuit theory, and least-cost path analysis, is here applied to the conservation planning requirements of the Mohave ground squirrel. The distribution of this threatened Californian species, as for numerous other desert species, overlaps with the proposed placement of several utility-scale renewable energy developments in the American southwest. Our approach uses information derived at three spatial scales to forecast potential changes in habitat connectivity under various scenarios of energy development and climate change. By disentangling the potential effects of habitat loss and fragmentation across multiple scales, we identify priority conservation areas for both core habitat and critical corridor or stepping stone habitats.

We developed a Bayesian network model to evaluate the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic stressors, and their mitigation, on the persistence of polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Overall sea ice conditions, affected by rising global temperatures, were the most influential determinant of population outcomes. Accordingly, unabated rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations was the dominant influence leading to worsened population outcomes, with polar bears in three of four ecoregions reaching a dominant probability of decreased or greatly decreased by the latter part of this century. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations by mid-century delayed the greatly reduced state by approximate to 25 yr in two ecoregions. Prompt and aggressive mitigation of emissions reduced the probability of any regional population becoming greatly reduced by up to 25%. Marine prey availability, linked closely to sea ice trend, had slightly less influence on outcome state than sea ice availability itself. Reduced mortality from hunting and defense of life and property interactions resulted in modest declines in the probability of a decreased or greatly decreased population outcome. Minimizing other stressors such as trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas exploration, and contaminants had a negligible effect on polar bear outcomes, although the model was not well-informed with respect to the potential influence of these stressors. Adverse consequences of loss of sea ice habitat became more pronounced as the summer ice-free period lengthened beyond four months, which could occur in most of the Arctic basin after mid-century if GHG emissions are not promptly reduced. Long-term conservation of polar bears would be best supported by holding global mean temperature to <= 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Until further sea ice loss is stopped, management of other stressors may serve to slow the transition of populations to progressively worsened outcomes, and improve the prospects for their long-term persistence.",,,,"Bromaghin, Jeffrey F/B-5058-2009","Bromaghin, Jeffrey F/0000-0002-7209-9500; Rode, Karyn/0000-0002-3328-8202; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104","U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Marine Mammals Management Office","This analysis is part of the U.S. Geological Survey Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area, with additional in-kind contributions from the U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station.

Here, we evaluate the relative role played by these two mechanisms in the long-term by quantifying wood-anatomical traits (tracheid size and area of parenchyma rays) and estimating the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) from carbon isotopic discrimination. We selected silver fir and Scots pine stands in NE Spain with ongoing dieback processes and compared trees showing contrasting vigour (declining vs nondeclining trees). In both species earlywood tracheids in declining trees showed smaller lumen area with thicker cell wall, inducing a lower theoretical hydraulic conductivity. Parenchyma ray area was similar between the two vigour classes. Wet spring and summer conditions promoted the formation of larger lumen areas, particularly in the case of nondeclining trees. Declining silver firs presented a lower iWUE than conspecific nondeclining trees, but the reverse pattern was observed in Scots pine. The described patterns in wood anatomical traits and iWUE are coherent with a long-lasting deterioration of the hydraulic system in declining trees prior to their dieback. Retrospective quantifications of lumen area permit to forecast dieback in declining trees 2-5 decades before growth decline started. Wood anatomical traits provide a robust tool to reconstruct the long-term capacity of trees to withstand drought-induced dieback.",,,,"Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015; Camarero, J.

In tallgrass prairie of the Central Plains of North America, grass flowering stalks of dominant C-4 grasses, such as Andropogon gerardii, can account for more than 70 % of ANPP, or almost none of it, as the number of flowering stalks produced is highly variable. Although growing season precipitation amount is important for driving variation in flowering stalk production, it remains unknown whether there are critical periods within the growing season in which sufficient rainfall must occur to allow for flowering. The effect of timing of rainfall deficit (drought) on flowering of A. gerardii, was tested by excluding rainfall during three periods within the growing season (starting in mid-April, mid-May and mid-June). Mid-summer drought (starting in mid-June) strongly reduced the flowering rate (e.g., density and biomass) of A. gerardii (e.g., as high as 94 % compared to the control), suggesting flowering is highly sensitive to precipitation at this time. This effect appeared to be related to plant water status at the time of flowering stalk initiation, rather than an indirect consequence of reduced C assimilation. Our results suggest that increased frequency of growing season drought forecast with climate change could reduce sexual reproduction in this dominant grass species, particularly if it coincides with timing of flowering stalk initiation, with important implications for ecosystem functioning.",,,,"Smith, Melinda D/J-8987-2014",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank the many individuals who helped make this work possible.

However, the ways in which complex food webs respond to climate variations remain poorly understood. Here, we use long-term time series to investigate the effects of temperature variation on the intraguild-predation (IGP) system of Windermere (UK), a lake where pike (Esox lucius, top predator) feed on small-sized perch (Perca fluviatilis) but compete with large-sized perch for the same food sources. Spectral analyses of time series reveal that pike recruitment dynamics are temperature controlled. In 1976, expansion of a size-truncating perch pathogen into the lake severely impacted large perch and favoured pike as the IGP-dominant species. This pathogen-induced regime shift to a pike-dominated IGP apparently triggered a temperature-controlled trophic cascade passing through pike down to dissolved nutrients. In simple food chains, warming is predicted to strengthen top-down control by accelerating metabolic rates in ectothermic consumers, while pathogens of top consumers are predicted to dampen this top-down control. In contrast, the local IGP structure in Windermere made warming and pathogens synergistic in their top-down effects on ecosystem functioning. More generally, our results point to top predators as major mediators of community response to global change, and show that size-selective agents (e.g. pathogens, fishers or hunters) may change the topological architecture of food webs and alter whole ecosystem sensitivity to climate variation.",,,,"Ghil, Michael/O-1433-2019; Groth, Andreas/I-5926-2019; Cazelles, Bernard/B-1572-2013; Ohlberger, Jan/H-3262-2019; Claessen, David/S-7596-2017; Winfield, Ian J/I-6085-2012; Stenseth, Nils Christian/G-5212-2016","Groth, Andreas/0000-0002-6690-9327; Cazelles, Bernard/0000-0002-7972-361X; Ohlberger, Jan/0000-0001-6795-240X; Claessen, David/0000-0001-7354-1316; Winfield, Ian J/0000-0001-9296-5114; Ghil, Michael/0000-0001-5177-7133; Stenseth, Nils Christian/0000-0002-1591-5399","Natural Environment Research Council of the UKNERC Natural Environment Research Council; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of Norway; French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-CEPL-0010 PULSE, ANR-10-BLAN-1709 PHYTBACK]; Groupement d'Interet Scientifique Reseau de Recherche sur le Developpement Soutenable of the Region Ile-de-France; EUEuropean Union (EU) [603378]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1049253, OCE-1243175]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [ceh020002, ceh020005]","We thank Janice Fletcher, Ben James and other colleagues for undertaking the field and laboratory work of the Windermere fish monitoring programme and Lorenzo Ciannelli for useful discussions.

For instance, most angiosperm tree species which have been studied in TDFs from a dendrochronological point of view present ring boundaries characterized by a band of marginal parenchyma.

Recent studies have underlined the importance of climatic variables in determining tree height and biomass in tropical forests. Nonetheless, the effects of climate on tropical forest carbon stocks remain uncertain. In particular, the application of process-based dynamic global vegetation models has led to contrasting conclusions regarding the potential impact of climate change on tropical forest carbon storage. 2. Using a correlative approach based on a bioclimatic envelope model and data from 1771 forest plots inventoried during the period 1996-2013 in Madagascar over a large climatic gradient, we show that temperature seasonality, annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are key variables in determining forest above-ground carbon density. 3. Taking into account the explicative climate variables, we obtained an accurate (R-2 = 70% and RMSE = 40 Mg ha(-1)) forest carbon map for Madagascar at 250 m resolution for the year 2010. This national map was more accurate than previously published global carbon maps (R-2 = 26% and RMSE >= 63 Mg ha(-1)). 4. Combining our model with the climatic projections for Madagascar from 7 IPCC CMIP5 global climate models following the RCP 8.5, we forecast an average forest carbon stock loss of 17% (range: 7-24%) by the year 2080. For comparison, a spatially homogeneous deforestation of 0.5% per year on the same period would lead to a loss of 30% of the forest carbon stock. 5. Synthesis. Our study shows that climate change is likely to induce a decrease in tropical forest carbon stocks. This loss could be due to a decrease in the average tree size and to shifts in tree species distribution, with the selection of small-statured species. In Madagascar, climate-induced carbon emissions might be, at least, of the same order of magnitude as emissions associated with anthropogenic deforestation.",,,,"Vieilledent, Ghislain/D-8323-2011","Vieilledent, Ghislain/0000-0002-1685-4997; Gond, Valery/0000-0002-0080-3140; Rasolohery, Andriambolantsoa/0000-0002-9686-262X; Grinand, Clovis/0000-0003-2650-2829",Cirad; AFD (Agence Francaise de Developpement) through the AT-REDD+ Madagascar project; FRB-FFEM (Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite - Fond Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial) through the BioSceneMada project [AAP-SCEN-2013 I],"Financial support was provided by Cirad, AFD (Agence Francaise de Developpement) through the AT-REDD+ Madagascar project and FRB-FFEM (Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite - Fond Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial) through the BioSceneMada project (project agreement AAP-SCEN-2013 I).

However, there is large interspecific variation in the velocity of range shifts. From a conservation perspective, it is important to understand which factors explain variation in the speed and the extent of range shifts, as these might be related to the species' extinction risk. Here, we study shifts in the mean latitude of occurrence, as weighted by population density, in different groups of landbirds using 40 years of line transect data from Finland. Our results show that the velocity of such density shifts differed among migration strategies and increased with decreasing body size of species, while breeding habitat had no influence. The slower velocity of large species could be related to their longer generation time and lower per capita reproduction that can decrease the dispersal ability compared to smaller species. In contrast to some earlier studies of range margin shifts, resident birds and partial migrants showed faster range shifts, while fully migratory species were moving more slowly. The results suggest that migratory species, especially long-distance migrants, which often show decreasing population trends, might also have problems in adjusting their distribution ranges to keep pace with global warming.",,,,"Linden, Andreas/D-9315-2017; Lehikoinen, Aleksi/O-5444-2016","Linden, Andreas/0000-0002-5548-2671; Lehikoinen, Aleksi/0000-0002-1989-277X",Finnish Ministry of Environment; Kone Foundation [46-1097]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [275606],"We are very grateful to the hundreds of bird-watchers who have participated in data collection.

However, such techniques use live plants and entrust most of their structural resistance to wood members whose mechanical characteristics diminish with time. To date, the decay of mechanical characteristics of wood elements employed in soil bioengineering techniques and lifetime predictions has been little explored. Such information is also important for durability forecasting. In this paper we present the results of experimental analyses carried out to evaluate the degradation of mechanical properties of untreated timber elements which were collected from single and double live cribwalls or check-dams built about ten years ago in the Vesuvius National Park (Naples, Southern Italy). To help interpret the behavior of a complex material such as wood, a novelty of this study lies not only in combining ultrasonic and sclerometric nondestructive testing (NDT) methods so as to reduce measurement errors, but also in framing the outcomes from mechanical tests within the biological analysis of fungi detected on the timbers. Exploratory statistical analyses reveal that there exist hardly any correlations between moisture contents in the timber elements and both transversal and longitudinal ultrasonic velocities, although some clustering provides insights into the results obtained. Comparisons between results using data measured on ""old"" and ""new"" timber elements enable some evaluations of residual safety factor assessment to be carried out. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Climate change scenarios forecast rising temperatures for the Mediterranean region, which could enhance the vulnerability to drought stress in forest ecosystems. The long-term effects of climate forcing on tree performance can be, however, modulated by other environmental factors, such as competition and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. 2. We assessed the concomitant effect of competition, climate and CO2 concentrations on the treering delta C-13-derived intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and basal area increments (BAI) of species with different drought tolerance: two Mediterranean deciduous species (Quercus faginea Lam. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and one conifer (Pinus sylvestris L.). Additionally, given that competition may be managed to mitigate the effect of increasing drought stress, we further examined the influence of this variable on iWUE and growth using data compiled from the literature, providing the first review on the response of iWUE to competition. 3. Competition had no significant effect on iWUE in any of the three species studied, whereas, as expected, growth rates were significantly higher under low-competition levels. This was consistent with the literature review, which showed that shifts in iWUE with competition changes are rare; supporting the hypothesis that leaf-level gas exchange tends to be a homeostatic trait. In the long term, the three species exhibited a significant increasing trend in iWUE due to the combined effect of increased CO2 concentration, climate and age. Growth, however, was mostly affected by competition and climate and in most cases was not enhanced as a result of the increase in iWUE. 4. Synthesis. Regardless of their functional response to drought, trees respond to reduced competition through the structural shifts such as increased radial growth rather than leaf-level gas exchange adjustments. CO2 and climate are, therefore, the main drivers of iWUE variability, rather than competition. Thus, if temperature-induced drought becomes limiting, reducing competition for resources may not offset the detrimental effect of increasing drought stress on tree physiology and growth decline may occur without a CO2 fertilization effect.",,,,"Ca�ellas, Isabel/B-7658-2008; Gea-Izquierdo, Guillermo/C-6159-2015","Ca�ellas, Isabel/0000-0002-9716-7776; Gea-Izquierdo, Guillermo/0000-0003-0148-3721","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2013 46028R, AGL2010-21153-C02]; Madrid Regional Government [S2013/MAE-2760]; REGEN-FOR; EUFORINO; Department of Energy, Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","The authors would like to thank the funding from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness for the projects AGL2013 46028R and AGL2010-21153-C02 and the associated PhD scholarship for L.F.U., the Madrid Regional Government for the projects S2013/MAE-2760 and REGEN-FOR, as well as funding from EUFORINO and the Department of Energy, Office of Science, to N.G.M.

The genetic structure and demographic history of a commercial fish, the black scorpionfish, Scorpaena porcus, was investigated throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas.

A weak contemporaneous genetic differentiation was identified between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. However, the genetic diversity was similar for populations of the two seas, suggesting a high number of colonizers entered the Black Sea during the interglacial period and/or the presence of a refugial population in the Black Sea during the glacial period. Finally, within seas, an east/west genetic differentiation in the Adriatic seems to prevail, whereas the Black Sea does not show any structured spatial genetic pattern of its population.

The stability of these complex ecological networks largely depends on how predator-prey interactions may respond to temperature changes. Because predators and prey rely on their velocities to catch food or avoid being eaten, understanding how temperatures may affect animal movement is central to this quest. Despite our efforts, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how the effect of temperature on metabolic processes scales up to animal movement and beyond. Here, we merge a biomechanical approach, the Metabolic Theory of Ecology and empirical data to show that animal movement displays multiple regimes of temperature dependence. We also show that crossing these regimes has important consequences for population dynamics and stability, which depend on the parameters controlling predator-prey interactions. We argue that this dependence upon interaction parameters may help explain why experimental work on the temperature dependence of interaction strengths has so far yielded conflicting results. More importantly, these changes in the temperature dependence of animal movement can have consequences that go well beyond ecological interactions and affect, for example, animal communication, mating, sensory detection, and any behavioral modality dependent on the movement of limbs.

Controls over seedling establishment govern forest development and migration potential. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), obligate symbionts of all Alaskan tree species, are particularly important to seedling establishment, yet their significance to landscape vegetation change is largely unknown. We used ALFRESCO, a landscape model of wildfire and vegetation dynamics, to explore whether EMF inoculum potential influences patterns of tundra afforestation and associated flammability. Using two downscaled CMIP3 general circulation models (ECHAM5 and CCCMA) and a mid-range emissions scenario (A1B) at a 1 km(2) resolution, we compared simulated tundra afforestation rates and flammability from four parameterizations of EMF effects on seedling establishment and growth from 2000 to 2100. Modeling predicted an 8.8-18.2 % increase in forest cover from 2000 to 2100. Simulations that explicitly represented landscape variability in EMF inoculum potential showed a reduced percent change afforestation of up to a 2.8 % due to low inoculum potential limiting seedling growth. This reduction limited fuel availability and thus, cumulative area burned. Regardless of inclusion of EMF effects in simulations, landscape flammability was lower for simulations driven by the wetter and cooler CCCMA model than the warmer and drier ECHAM5 model, while tundra afforestation was greater. Results suggest abiotic factors are the primary driver of tree migration. Simulations including EMF effects, a biotic factor, yielded more conservative estimates of land cover change across Alaska that better-matched empirical estimates from the previous century.",,,,"Taylor, Lee/V-1921-2019","Taylor, Donald/0000-0002-5985-9210",Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning; Alaska Climate Science Center; Joint Fire Science Graduate Research Innovation Award; United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey [G10AC00588],"The Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning, the Alaska Climate Science Center, and the Joint Fire Science Graduate Research Innovation Award supported this research.

In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models' ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.

Such complexity creates difficulties for managers trying to conserve populations across large areas. This study develops, applies, and tests the use of stochastic life-history modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess management scenarios related to the realities of regional fisheries management and conservation. We apply this approach to the management of recreational brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) fishing; an activity that can severely impact species balance, abundance, and the size structure of fish communities. Specifically, the model incorporates population-specific life-history information (e.g., growth rate, reproductive effort, and survival) to allow forecasts of the impact of various management strategies and/or changes to environmental conditions on a population's ecological characteristics (e.g., size structure, abundance, and probability of persistence). Sampling was carried out in 16 water bodies spread across four sites in Atlantic Canada. Each water body was sampled in 2005 and reassessed in 2008. This sampling had two primary objectives: (1) define a significant proportion of life-history variation of brook trout in Atlantic Canada, and (2) to test the precision and accuracy of model predictions of population responses to experimental exploitation and management changes. The model successfully predicted population responses to changes in adult survival in 12 of 13 populations having sufficient data for validation testing, while also proving to be a useful tool when engaging stakeholders regarding management options and their associated risk. We suggest that such models are cost-effective and have great potential for informing proactive management of jurisdictions with numerous and diverse populations.",,,,"Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012",,Parks Canada; Board of Directors at the Indian Bay Ecosystem Corporation; Parks Canada's Ecological Integrity Innovation and Leadership Fund,"We thank Tom Knight, Renee Wissink, Dan Kehler, Mervin Langdon, Shirley Butland, Mario Sippley, and Raymond Reid of Parks Canada and Winston Norris and the Board of Directors at the Indian Bay Ecosystem Corporation for field, logistical, and financial support.

Most regional estimates of forest biomass apply allometric equations, with parameters estimated from a limited number of studies, to forest inventory data (i.e., tree diameter). However, most of these allometric equations cannot account for potential effects of increased N availability on biomass allocation patterns. Using 18 yr of tree diameter, height, and mortality data collected for a dominant tree species (Acer saccharum) in an atmospheric N deposition experiment, we evaluated how greater N availability affects allometric relationships in this species. After taking into account site and individual variability, our results reveal significant differences in allometric parameters between ambient and experimental N deposition treatments. Large trees under experimental N deposition reached greater heights at a given diameter; moreover, their estimated maximum height (mean +/- standard deviation: 33.7 +/- 0.38 m) was significantly higher than that estimated under the ambient condition (31.3 +/- 0.31 m). Within small tree sizes (5-10 cm diameter) there was greater mortality under experimental N deposition, whereas the relative growth rates of small trees were greater under experimental N deposition. Calculations of stemwood biomass using our parameter estimates for the diameter-height relationship indicated the potential for significant biases in these estimates (+/- 2.5%), with under predictions of stemwood biomass averaging 4 Mg/ha lower if ambient parameters were to be used to estimate stem biomass of trees in the experimental N deposition treatment. As atmospheric N deposition continues to increase into the future, ignoring changes in tree allometry will contribute to the uncertainty associated with aboveground carbon storage estimates across a forest with a large geographic distribution in eastern North America.",,,,"Khitov, Sergey/P-1280-2019","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997","NSF LTREB grant [DEB 1252841]; DoE Division of Environmental BiologyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0004850, DE-SC0010541]",Our research was supported by an NSF LTREB grant DEB 1252841 and by grants from the DoE Division of Environmental Biology DE-SC0004850 and DE-SC0010541.

However, the impacts can vary depending on the species or taxa examined, suggesting that the influences of interactions on species distributions and diversity are not always straightforward and can be taxon-contingent. The aim of this study was therefore to examine how the importance of biotic interactions varies within a community. We incorporated three biotic predictors (cover of the dominant vascular species) into two correlative species richness modelling frameworks to predict spatial variation in the number of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in arctic-alpine Fennoscandia, in N Europe. In addition, predictions based on single-species distribution models were used to determine the nature of the impact (negative vs. positive outcome) of the three dominant species on individual vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species. Our results suggest that biotic variables can be as important as abiotic variables, but their relative contributions in explaining the richness of sub-dominant species vary among dominant species, species group and the modelling framework implemented. Similarly, the impacts of biotic interactions on individual species varied among the three species groups and dominant species, with the observed patterns partly reflecting species' biogeographic range. Our study provides additional support for the importance of biotic interactions in modifying arctic-alpine biodiversity patterns and highlights that the impacts of interactions are not constant across taxa or biotic drivers. The influence of biotic interactions, including the taxon contingency and range-based impacts, should therefore be accounted for when developing biodiversity forecasts.",,,,"Heikkinen, Risto K./AAN-6257-2020; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011","Heikkinen, Risto K./0000-0003-4190-5108; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Mod, Heidi/0000-0001-7800-2688; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [1140873]; Research Foundation of the University of Helsinki,We acknowledge funding from the Academy of Finland (Project Number 1140873).

In May 2007, a tropical storm on the east coast of Florida resulted in severe dune erosion and permission was given for beach and dune restoration. Nests already located on the beach, or that were laid prior to project commencement, were relocated at times varying between 10 days and 38 days post-deposition. This provided an opportunity to examine egg mortality in loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests moved during this critical time period, and determine whether there was a correlation between the relocation and the timing of arrested egg development; we compared hatching and emergence success to nests relocated during the standard initial 12 hours post-deposition and those left in situ. Following hatchling emergence, we collected remaining unhatched eggs to determine development stage at the time of embryonic death. Mean hatch success was 53% for nests moved mid-incubation, versus 79-90% for nests left in situ or moved within 12 hours of deposition. For 6 of 10 nests, embryonic development ceased at the same visual developmental stage as the relocation. Although moving nests later than 12 hours decreases nest success and should be a matter of last resort, the forecasts for increased storm activity and sea level rise, and other impacts such as beach oiling, may necessitate nest relocation under less than ideal circumstances. Choice of relocation site may also be significant; nests placed in native sand had lower emergence success than those moved to the renourished area.

Different stages of regeneration often require different ecological conditions, but dynamic constraints on regeneration are poorly known for species that regenerate only after infrequent wildfires. Focussing on a long-lived, foundation tree species (Eucalyptus regnans), we tested the hypothesis that the relative importance of fire regime variables (fire severity and time since previous fire) and environmental gradients on post-fire regeneration would shift as seedlings developed. LocationSouth-eastern Australia. MethodsFollowing a large (>59,000ha) summer wildfire in 2009, we sampled 131 sites (61 burnt) annually for four years (2009-2012), representing the range of environmental conditions in which E. regnans occurs. We analysed the effect of fire severity, time since fire and environmental variables on early regeneration processes critical for post-fire species distributions: seedling establishment, seedling density and growth through different height stages (10cm, 25cm, 50cm and 200cm). ResultsThe regeneration niche of E. regnans was defined by different factors at different stages of development. Initially, seedlings established prolifically on burnt sites, regardless of severity. Three years into the regeneration process, high-severity fire became the dominant driver of seedling persistence and growth over 25cm. Growth over 50cm was dependent on environmental conditions relating to elevation and precipitation. Main conclusionsOur results describe how fire occurrence, fire severity and environmental gradients affected seedling establishment, persistence and growth. The dynamic constraints on regeneration likely reflect temporal changes in the biotic and abiotic environment and variation in resource requirements during the early post-fire years. Our findings will enable more accurate forecasts of species distributions to assist forest conservation in the face of global changes in climate and fire regimes.",,,,"Smith, Annabel L./M-6391-2014; Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017; Banks, Sam/K-4907-2012","Smith, Annabel L./0000-0002-1201-8713; Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; Banks, Sam/0000-0003-2415-0057; Driscoll, Don/0000-0002-1560-5235","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Australian Government Department of EnvironmentAustralian Government; Victorian Government Department of Primary Industries and Environment, Parks Victoria, Melbourne Water; Thomas Foundation","John Stein helped compile spatial data.

Among the principal analytical approaches to predicting and understanding future impacts of biological invasions are Species Distribution Models (SDMs), typically in the form of correlative Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). An underlying assumption of ENMs is that species-environment relationships remain preserved during extrapolations in space and time, although this is widely criticised. The semi-mechanistic modelling platform, CLIMEX, employs a top-down approach using species ecophysiological traits and is able to avoid some of the issues of extrapolation, making it highly applicable to investigating biological invasions in the context of climate change. The tephritid fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) comprise some of the most successful invasive species and serious economic pests around the world. Here we project 12 tephritid species CLIMEX models into future climate scenarios to examine overall patterns of climate suitability and forecast potential distributional changes for this group. We further compare the aggregate response of the group against species-specific responses. We then consider additional drivers of biological invasions to examine how invasion potential is influenced by climate, fruit production and trade indices. Considering the group of tephritid species examined here, climate change is predicted to decrease global climate suitability and to shift the cumulative distribution poleward. However, when examining species-level patterns, the predominant directionality of range shifts for 11 of the 12 species is eastward. Most notably, management will need to consider regional changes in fruit fly species invasion potential where high fruit production, trade indices and predicted distributions of these flies overlap.",,,,"Terblanche, John/AAB-4457-2020","Bertelsmeier, Cleo/0000-0003-3624-1300; Hill, Matthew/0000-0002-7762-5258",HortGro; National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa; Stellenbosch University; SubTrop,"The paper had its origin at a workshop on ""Drivers, impacts, mechanisms and adaptation in insect invasions"" hosted by the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in November 2014.

For reaching these goals, new methodological developments were applied to improve reliability of forecasts. Water temperature data were collected using 11 thermographs located along the altitudinal gradient, and they were used to model the relationship between stream temperature and air temperature along the river continuum. Trout abundance was studied using electrofishing at 37 sites to determine the current distribution. The Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 change scenarios adopted by the International Panel of Climate Change for its Fifth Assessment Report were used for simulations and local downscaling in this study. We found more reliable results using the daily mean stream temperature than maximum daily temperature and their respective 7days moving average to determine the distribution thresholds. Thereby, the observed limits of the summer distribution of brown trout were linked to thresholds between 18.1 and 18.7 degrees C. These temperatures characterize a realized thermal niche narrower than the physiological thermal range. In the most unfavourable climate change scenario, the thermal habitat loss of brown trout increased to 38% (Cega stream) and 11% (Piron stream) in the upstream direction at the end of the century; however, at the Cega stream, the range reduction could reach 56% due to the effect of a 'warm-window' opening in the piedmont reach.

The interplay between environmental and density effects is one particularly important aspect of such forecasts. We examined the simultaneous impact of climate and intraspecific density on vital rates of the dwarf shrub Fumana procumbens over 20 yr, using generalized additive mixed models. We then analyzed effects on population dynamics using integral projection models. The population projection models accurately captured observed fluctuations in population size. Our analyses suggested the population was intrinsically regulated but with annual fluctuations in response to variation in weather. Simulations showed that implicitly assuming variation in demographic rates to be driven solely by the environment can overestimate extinction risks if there is density dependence. We conclude that density regulation can dampen effects of climate change on Fumana population size, and discuss the need to quantify density dependence in predictions of population responses to environmental changes.",,,,,"Dahlgren, Johan/0000-0002-1125-9769; Ehrlen, Johan/0000-0001-8539-8967",Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnsson Foundation; Sallskapet DBW:s Stiftelse; Gotland University; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society; Swedish Research Council (VR)Swedish Research Council,"Johan Dahlgren and Karin Bengtsson contributed equally to the study.

In an era of rapidly changing climate, the relationship between the timing of those events and environmental cues such as temperature, snowmelt, water availability, or day length are of particular interest. This article provides an overview of the observer-based plant phenology sampling conducted by the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the resulting data, and the rationale behind the design. Trained technicians will conduct regular in situ observations of plant phenology at all terrestrial NEON sites for the 30-yr life of the observatory. Standardized and coordinated data across the network of sites can be used to quantify the direction and magnitude of the relationships between phenology and environmental forcings, as well as the degree to which these relationships vary among sites, among species, among phenophases, and through time. Vegetation at NEON sites will also be monitored with tower-based cameras, satellite remote sensing, and annual high-resolution airborne remote sensing. Ground-based measurements can be used to calibrate and improve satellite-derived phenometrics. NEON's phenology monitoring design is complementary to existing phenology research efforts and citizen science initiatives throughout the world and will produce interoperable data. By collocating plant phenology observations with a suite of additional meteorological, biophysical, and ecological measurements (e.g., climate, carbon flux, plant productivity, population dynamics of consumers) at 47 terrestrial sites, the NEON design will enable continental-scale inference about the status, trends, causes, and ecological consequences of phenological change.",,,,"Diez, Jeffrey/AAD-5956-2019; Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012; Moore, David JP/A-6268-2013; Miller-Rushing, Abraham/D-5102-2009","Moore, David JP/0000-0002-6462-3288; Miller-Rushing, Abraham/0000-0003-3203-0143; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1029808],"We thank Shirley Papuga, Yuri Springer, and Lee Stanish for helpful comments on the manuscript.

With many land-use and climatological changes occurring simultaneously, pinning down the causes of large-scale conservation problems requires sophisticated and data-intensive approaches. Declining shorebird numbers along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, in combination with data on habitat loss along the Yellow Sea (where these birds refuel during long-distance migrations), indicate a flyway under threat. If habitat loss at staging areas indeed leads to flyway-wide bird losses, we would predict that: (i) decreases in survival only occur during the season that birds use the Yellow Sea, and (ii) decreases in survival occur in migrants that share a reliance on the vanishing intertidal flats along the Yellow Sea, even if ecologically distinct and using different breeding grounds. Monitored from 2006-2013, we analysed seasonal apparent survival patterns of three shorebird species with non-overlapping Arctic breeding areas and considerable differences in foraging ecology, but a shared use of both north-west Australian non-breeding grounds and the Yellow Sea coasts to refuel during northward and southward migrations (red knot Calidris canutus piersmai, great knot Calidris tenuirostris, bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica menzbieri). Distinguishing two three-month non-breeding periods and a six-month migration and breeding period, and analysing survival of the three species and the three seasons in a single model, we statistically evaluated differences at both the species and season levels. Whereas apparent survival remained high in north-west Australia, during the time away from the non-breeding grounds survival in all three species began to decline in 2011, having lost 20 percentage points by 2012. By 2012 annual apparent survival had become as low as 071 in bar-tailed godwits, 068 in great knots and 067 in red knots. In a separate analysis for red knots, no mortality occurred during the migration from Australia to China. In the summers of low summer survival, weather conditions were benign in the Arctic breeding areas. We argue that rapid seashore habitat loss in the Yellow Sea is the most likely explanation of reduced summer survival, with dire (but uncertain) forecasts for the future of these flyway populations. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings of declining shorebird numbers at seemingly intact southern non-breeding sites. Policy implications. Due to established economic interests, governments are usually reluctant to act for conservation, unless unambiguous evidence for particular cause-effect chains is apparent. This study adds to an increasing body of evidence that habitat loss along the Yellow Sea shores explains the widespread declines in shorebird numbers along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and threatens the long-term prospects of several long-distance migrating species. To halt further losses, the clearance of coastal intertidal habitat must stop now.

Existing variation provides a window into the effects of climate on species and ecosystems, but in many places does not encompass the levels or timeframes of forcing expected under directional climatic change. Experiments help us to fill in these uncertainties, simulating directional shifts to examine outcomes of new levels and sustained changes in conditions. Here, we explore the translation between short-term responses to climate variability and longer-term trajectories that emerge under directional climatic change. In a decade-long experiment, we compare effects of short-term and long-term forcings across three trophic levels in grassland plots subjected to natural and experimental variation in precipitation. For some biological responses (plant productivity), responses to long-term extension of the rainy season were consistent with short-term responses, while for others (plant species richness, abundance of invertebrate herbivores and predators), there was pronounced divergence of long-term trajectories from short-term responses. These differences between biological responses mean that sustained directional changes in climate can restructure ecological relationships characterizing a system. Importantly, a positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity turned negative under one scenario of climate change, with a similar change in the relationship between plant productivity and consumer biomass.

Almost all of this work has been done in the context of evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability) and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia, flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits.",,,,"Adriaenssens, Bart/G-3552-2010","Adriaenssens, Bart/0000-0001-8631-2993; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)NERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J019100/1]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [640004]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; NERC standard grant [NE/K00400X/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)NERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J019100/1]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [640004]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; NERC standard grant [NE/K00400X/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J019100/1, NE/K00400X/1]",S.S.K. was supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Advanced Fellowship NE/J019100/1 and European Research Council Starting grant no. 640004.

Here, we conduct a controlled comparison of five paired SDMs and CLMs across changing climates, using palaeoclimatic simulations and fossil pollen records of eastern North America for the past 21 000 years. Both SDMs and CLMs performed poorly when projected to time periods that are temporally distant and climatically dissimilar from those in which they were fit; however, CLMs generally outperformed SDMs in these instances, especially when models were fit with sparse calibration datasets.

Our results showed a nonlinear response of Z. noltei in this factorial design, with the strongest negative effect of NH4+ enrichment recorded at intermediate flow velocities for almost all the dynamic response variables (i.e. survival, net production, shoot appearance rate). This negative effect of NH4+ enrichment was intensified under low light conditions, where net production was only positive in plants growing at high flow velocity. This positive effect of flow velocity was ascribed to the more horizontal position of the leaves, which allows for higher levels of light capture than under lower flow velocities. However, enhancing current velocity may increase NH4+ uptake rates until they reach adverse levels, which can potentially trigger NH4+ toxicity. This negative effect of flow velocity seems to be neutralized by the higher light capture at high flow, resulting in intermediate current velocities being more harmful for plants.

Modifying perennial grass seeding rates and frequency may increase perennial grass establishment, yet these impacts have not yet been quantified. To assess these effects, we established a field experiment consisting of 288 plots (1 m(2)) in an eastern Oregon annual grass-dominated shrubsteppe ecosystem. In this study, the amount, timing, and frequency of perennial grass seeding events, soil moisture availability, and annual grass seed bank density were manipulated. We found that more frequent perennial grass seeding events combined with high perennial grass seeding rates produced the highest perennial grass density and biomass 2 years following seeding. However, we also found that if annual grass seed density was 1500 seeds . m(-2) or higher, perennial grass density and biomass decreased, regardless of seeding strategy. Because of this finding, it appears that a threshold is crossed between 150 and 1500 annual grass seeds . m(-2). Adding water in the first growing season initially facilitated perennial grass establishment but only produced higher perennial grass density following the second growing season when annual grass density was lowest. Assessing the existing annual grass seed bank prior to seeding can likely forecast restoration outcomes because high annual grass seed densities likely interfere with and reduce perennial grass recruitment. In addition, if annual grass seeding density is 1500 seeds . m(-2) or lower, modifying the temporal patterns of perennial grass seed arrival will increase the likelihood that a perennial grass seed finds a safe-site.",,,,"Schantz, Merilynn/AAA-3280-2019","Schantz, Merilynn/0000-0002-7740-2345",USDA-ARS EBIPM research project,"We thank Brett Bingham and Anna Masterson for field and laboratory assistance.

The geographical information system (GIS) based cellular automata model, BorealFireSim, serves as a tool to identify future fire patterns in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The model was calibrated using 1950-2010 climate data for the present baseline and forecasts of burning probability up to 2100 were calculated using two RCP scenarios of climate change. Results show that, with every scenario, the mean area burned will likely increase on a provincial scale, while some areas might expect decreases with a low emission scenario. Comparison with other models shows that areas forecasted to have an increase in fire likelihood, overlap with predicted areas of higher vegetation productivity.

We incorporate our detailed knowledge of the native-range source populations and global introduction history of the delicate skink Lampropholis delicata to examine intraspecific variation in realized niche expansion and unfilling, and investigate how alternative niche modelling approaches are affected by that variation. We analyzed the realized niche dynamics of L. delicata using an ordination method, ecological niche models (ENMs), and occurrence records from 1) Australia (native range), 2) New Zealand, 3) Hawaii, 4) the two distinct native-range clades that were the sources for the New Zealand and Hawaii introductions, and 5) the species' global range (including Lord Howe Island, Australia). We found a gradient of realized niche change across the invaded ranges of L. delicata: niche stasis on Lord Howe Island, niche unfilling in New Zealand (16%), and niche unfilling (87%) and expansion (14%) in Hawaii. ENMs fitted to native-range data generally identified suitable climatic conditions at sites where the species has established non-native populations, whereas ENMs based on native-range source clades and non-native populations had lower spatial transferability. Our results suggest that the extent to which realized niches are maintained during invasion does not depend on species-level traits. When realized niche shifts are predominately due to niche unfilling, fully capturing species' responses along climatic gradients by basing ENMs on native distributions may be more important for accurate invasion forecasts than incorporating phylogenetic differentiation, or integrating niche changes in the invaded range.",,,,"Hartley, Stephen/A-2794-2008","Hartley, Stephen/0000-0002-9049-5072; Tingley, Reid/0000-0002-7630-7434; Thompson, Michael/0000-0002-2496-992X",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0771913]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [CRE 8085-06]; Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution; Monash Univ.

Humans are rapidly changing the marine environment through increasing greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in ocean warming and acidification. The first response by animals to environmental change is predominantly through modification of their behaviour, which in turn affects species interactions and ecological processes. Yet, many climate change studies ignore animal behaviour. Furthermore, our current knowledge of how global change alters animal behaviour is mostly restricted to single species, life phases and stressors, leading to an incomplete view of how coinciding climate stressors can affect the ecological interactions that structure biological communities. Here, we first review studies on the effects of warming and acidification on the behaviour of marine animals. We demonstrate how pervasive the effects of global change are on a wide range of critical behaviours that determine the persistence of species and their success in ecological communities. We then evaluate several approaches to studying the ecological effects of warming and acidification, and identify knowledge gaps that need to be filled, to better understand how global change will affect marine populations and communities through altered animal behaviours. Our review provides a synthesis of the far-reaching consequences that behavioural changes could have for marine ecosystems in a rapidly changing environment. Without considering the pervasive effects of climate change on animal behaviour we will limit our ability to forecast the impacts of ocean change and provide insights that can aid management strategies.",,,,"Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011; Munday, Philip/F-5443-2011","Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940; Munday, Philip/0000-0001-9725-2498",Australian Research Council Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT120100183]; Australian Research Council Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"IN was supported by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (grant no.

The local government has proposed a dam downstream of the lake to control the declining trend. The construction of the lake level control structure could affect the migration of some aquatic animals, including this endangered porpoise specie. A two dimensional (2D) diffusion model was developed to assess the movements of porpoises in Poyang Lake with the dam in place. This 2D model was coupled with a hydrodynamic model to evaluate the passage efficiency of the proposed bypass system of the planned dam. The diffusion model was based on the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. In this model porpoises were treated as particles which have flow velocity preference and share similar modes of mechanics with porpoises. The model was built on the Eulerian framework so that it can be well coupled with the general hydrodynamic model. The porpoise's distribution and movements are represented by particle diffusion. What's more, this model is suitable for modeling distributions of other aquatic species, such as fish, due to its sophisticated theoretical principles. The results indicated that the passage efficiency of the bypass system is acceptable whether in the dry or wet seasons. We also applied the model to the entire Poyang Lake to predict the possible habitats for the porpoises. The control equation of the model will be complemented with other source terms, i.e., water temperature, water quality, and water depth to consider their future impacts from this development.

Interactions between plants and microbes will mediate the ecosystem processes further through microbe-mediated plant-soil feedback (PSF). To investigate the possible consequences of interactions between the extension of the growing season (GS) and PSF under various conditions, we developed a simple theoretical model (LGS-PSF model). The LGS-PSF model predicts that microbe-mediated PSF will intensify the negative effects of increasing temperature on the size of soil carbon stock when compared with simulations without the PSF effect. The combined effects of increasing temperature and PSF on the size of soil carbon stock occurs through enhanced activity of individual microbes and increased microbial population size. More importantly, the model also demonstrated that a longer GS mitigates this negative effect on carbon accumulation in soil, not through increased net primary production, but through intensified competition for nutrients between plants and microbes, thus suppressing microbial population growth. Our model suggested that the interactive effects of the LGS and PSF on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in forests should be incorporated into larger scale quantitative models for better forecasting of future forest functions under climate change.",,,,"Miki, Takeshi/F-8189-2010","Miki, Takeshi/0000-0002-2452-8681","National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University [10R70604-3]; Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [NSC101-2621-B-002-004-MY3]",National Taiwan University (Grant No. 10R70604-3) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. NSC101-2621-B-002-004-MY3) supported this research for T.

This lack of data hampers global biodiversity assessments and conservation planning. Here, we developed a new framework that systematically quantifies extinction risk based on allometric relationships between various wildlife demographic parameters and body size. These allometric relationships have a solid theoretical and ecological foundation. Extinction risk indicators included are (1) the probability of extinction, (2) the mean time to extinction, and (3) the critical patch size. We applied our framework to assess the global extinction vulnerability of terrestrial carnivorous and non-carnivorous birds and mammals. Irrespective of the indicator used, large-bodied species were found to be more vulnerable to extinction than their smaller counterparts. The patterns with body size were confirmed for all species groups by a comparison with IUCN data on the proportion of extant threatened species: the models correctly predicted a multimodal distribution with body size for carnivorous birds and a monotonic distribution for mammals and non-carnivorous birds. Carnivorous mammals were found to have higher extinction risks than non-carnivores, while birds were more prone to extinction than mammals. These results are explained by the allometric relationships, predicting the vulnerable species groups to have lower intrinsic population growth rates, smaller population sizes, lower carrying capacities, or larger dispersal distances, which, in turn, increase the importance of losses due to environmental stochastic effects and dispersal activities. Our study is the first to integrate population viability analysis and allometry into a novel, process-based framework that is able to quantify extinction risk of a large number of species without requiring data-intensive, species-specific information. The framework facilitates the estimation of extinction vulnerabilities of data-deficient species. It may be applied to forecast extinction vulnerability in response to a changing environment, by incorporating quantitative relationships between wildlife demographic parameters and environmental drivers like habitat alteration, climate change, or hunting.",,,,"Schipper, Aafke M/C-2758-2011; Hendriks, Aalbert Jan/C-6767-2013; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/B-3975-2009; Huijbregts, Mark A.J./B-8971-2011","Pereira, Henrique Miguel/0000-0003-1043-1675; Huijbregts, Mark A.J./0000-0002-7037-680X; Hilbers, Jelle/0000-0002-9401-589X; Verones, Francesca/0000-0002-2908-328X",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [308552],"This research project was funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme on Environment, ENV.2012.6.3-3: DESIRE DEvelopment of a System of Indicators for a Resource efficient Europe (grant agreement number 308552).",,,10,10,6,71,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2016,97,3,,,,,615,626,,10.1890/14-2019.1,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000373565900008,27197389,,,,

Macrophysiology is the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographic and temporal scales and the ecological implications of this variation.

Macrophysiology builds on approaches that investigate the ecological and evolutionary significance of physiological trait variation and feedbacks in these processes. One of its key strengths is its ability to provide a basis for examining interactions among the intraspecific, interspecific and assemblage levels. 3. Macrophysiology is distinct from and typically concerns larger spatial and temporal scales than conservation physiology, whereas it is in several respects similar to, but antecedes, functional biogeography. Contrary to some claims, macrophysiology is not concerned only with the implications for geographic ranges of physiological trait variation. 5. Several insights, which would not otherwise have been achieved, have arisen from the field, notably the understanding of variation in global patterns of upper and lower lethal temperature limits and organism performance, which have important implications for forecasting the impacts of climate change. 6.

Specialist pests and pathogens are unique disturbances, as they commonly target individual species that are relatively prevalent in the community. Understanding the consequences of pathogen-caused mortality requires using sometimes limited available data to create statistical models that can forecast future community states. In the last two decades, ash dieback disease has swept through Europe causing widespread mortality of Fraxinus excelsior L. (European ash) across much of its distribution. In the UK, F.excelsior is an abundant and ecologically important species. Using demographic data from an 18ha plot in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, we built models that forecast the response of this forest plot to the loss of F.excelsior. We combine integral projection models and individual-based models to link models of growth, survival and fecundity to population dynamics. We demonstrate likely responses in Wytham by comparing projections under different levels of F.excelsior mortality. To extrapolate results to other systems, we test hypotheses regarding the role of abundance, spatial structure and demographic differences between species in determining community response to disease disturbance. We show that the outcome of succession is determined largely by the differing demographic strategies and starting abundances of competing species. Spatial associations between species were shown to have little effect on community dynamics at the spatial scale of this plot.Synthesis. Host-specific pests and pathogens are an increasingly important type of disturbance. We have developed a framework that makes use of forest inventory data to forecast changes in the population dynamics of remaining species and the consequences for community structure.

The psychological literature tells us that stakeholders rarely think of such a distant future and when they do, they employ cognitive styles different from the ones commonly used for planning and decision making, which the ecological models are designed to facilitate. This may affect the reception of modelling efforts in several ways. Stakeholders may question the very purpose of trying to say anything meaningful about such a distant future; may consider model outputs as irrelevant to planning; or may provide emotional, often unconscious, responses motivated by deeply held fears and aspirations. Modellers too may display some of these behaviours. Here, we review the relevant literature and describe a questionnaire a modeller could use to explore these issues within a stakeholder group. We also report an experiment which shows how the very act of answering the questionnaire can significantly change the perception of future time horizon and future concerns and discuss the possible implications for modelling projects.

It has been suggested that the range of expansion of the species in the Mediterranean will be limited by the 15 degrees C sea surface isotherm. Here we tested the effects of temperature on survival, photosynthesis, leaf growth and clonal growth of H. stipulacea. We analysed the temporal and spatial variation of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Mediterranean Sea and the species' spread rate since its introduction to forecast its future expansion and potential changes in the spread rate due to increased SST. We estimated that the species has been spreading throughout the Mediterranean with a variable rate averaging 12 km yr(-1). Despite being a species native to the tropics, it was able to survive, photosynthesise and grow within a broad range of temperatures (10 to 30 degrees C). At 10 degrees C, a temperature colder than the winter's lowest isotherm for most of the Mediterranean Sea, the clonal growth ceased but plants did not die and continued to photosynthesise and produce new leaf biomass. The maximum photosynthetic rate peaked at 30 degrees C but the optimal leaf growth rate was within the range of temperatures for temperate seagrass species (11.5 to 26 degrees C). Based on the present spread rate and on the non-limiting effect of temperature, we estimate that in the next 100 yr H. stipulacea will be present throughout the whole Mediterranean Sea (but perhaps not the north Adriatic), potentially spreading into the Atlantic.",,,,"Santos, Rui O P/B-4168-2008; Alexandre, Ana/L-3121-2013","Santos, Rui O P/0000-0002-7861-4366; Alexandre, Ana/0000-0001-7164-1487",,,,,14,14,1,34,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in which node makes links with which other node, whereas the centrality term quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers us a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics explain network architecture.

While disturbance is also potentially an important driver of landscape genetic patterns, the mechanisms by which these patterns may arise by selective and neutral processes are not well-understood. We used simulation to evaluate the relative importance of disturbance regime components, and their interaction with demographic and dispersal processes, on the distribution of genetic diversity across landscapes. We investigated genetic impacts of variation in key components of disturbance regimes and spatial patterns that are likely to respond to climate change and land management, including disturbance size, frequency, and severity. The influence of disturbance was mediated by dispersal distance and, to a limited extent, by birth rate. Nevertheless, all three disturbance regime components strongly influenced spatial and temporal patterns of genetic diversity within subpopulations, and were associated with changes in genetic structure. Furthermore, disturbance-induced changes in temporal population dynamics and the spatial distribution of populations across the landscape resulted in disrupted isolation by distance patterns among populations. Our results show that forecast changes in disturbance regimes have the potential to cause major changes to the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations. We highlight likely scenarios under which future changes to disturbance size, severity, or frequency will have the strongest impacts on population genetic patterns. In addition, our results have implications for the inference of biological processes from genetic data, because the effects of dispersal on genetic patterns were strongly mediated by disturbance regimes.",,,,"Banks, Sam/K-4907-2012; Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017","Banks, Sam/0000-0003-2415-0057; Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; Cary, Geoffrey J./0000-0002-6386-1751",,,,,19,19,0,60,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

It is challenging to forecast the spatial structure of wildlife population dynamics because density dependence and environmental effects vary spatially. We developed models that incorporated density dependence and climatic (precipitation and temperature) effects to explain pond (wetland) dynamics and models that incorporated density dependence and pond effect to explain Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population dynamics. We trained the models using data from 1974 to 1998 and tested their hindcast performance with data from 1999 to 2010 to examine the scale at which the spatial variation of density dependence and climatic/pond effects should be incorporated to forecast pond and Mallard population dynamics. The pond model that did not allow density dependence and climatic effects to vary spatially (Delta MSE = 0.007-0.018) and the Mallard model that incorporated the spatial variation of density dependence and pond effect at the scale of Bird Conservation Regions (Delta MSE = 0.011-0.012) had the best hindcast performance. Using these models we forecasted the largest decrease (34.7%-43.0%) of Mallard density in the northern Prairie Pothole Region under two climate change scenarios, suggesting that the local Mallard population in this area might be particularly vulnerable to potential future warming. Our results provide insight into the factors that drive the spatial structure of waterfowl population dynamics. Because the spatial variation of density dependence and environmental effects is commonly found in wildlife populations, our framework of modeling and evaluation has wide application for conservation planning in response to climate change.

A variety of spatial prioritisation techniques have been developed to incorporate climate change. Here, we provide the first standardised review of these approaches. Using a systematic search, we analysed peer-reviewed spatial prioritisation publications (n = 46) and found that the most common approaches (n = 41, 89%) utilised forecasts of species distributions and aimed to either protect future species habitats (n = 24, 52%) or identify climate refugia to shelter species from climate change (n = 17, 37%). Other approaches (n = 17, 37%) used well-established conservation planning principles to combat climate change, aimed at broadly increasing either connectivity (n = 11, 24%) or the degree of heterogeneity of abiotic factors captured in the planning process (n = 8, 17%), with some approaches combining multiple goals. We also find a strong terrestrial focus (n = 35, 76%), and heavy geographical bias towards North America (n = 8, 17%) and Australia (n = 11, 24%). While there is an increasing trend of incorporating climate change into spatial prioritisation, we found that serious gaps in current methodologies still exist. Future research must focus on developing methodologies that allow planners to incorporate human responses to climate change and recognise that discrete climate impacts (e.g. extreme events), which are increasing in frequency and severity, must be addressed within the spatial prioritisation framework By identifying obvious gaps and highlighting future research needs this review will help practitioners better plan for conservation action in the face of multiple threats including climate change.

Here, we provide a framework to link SIF retrievals and crop yield, accounting for stoichiometry, photosynthetic pathways, and respiration losses. We apply this framework to estimate United States crop productivity for 2007-2012, where we use the spaceborne SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 satellite, benchmarked with county-level crop yield statistics, and compare it with various traditional crop monitoring approaches. We find that a SIF-based approach accounting for photosynthetic pathways (i.e. C-3 and C-4 crops) provides the best measure of crop productivity among these approaches, despite the fact that SIF sensors are not yet optimized for terrestrial applications. We further show that SIF provides the ability to infer the impacts of environmental stresses on autotrophic respiration and carbon-use-efficiency, with a substantial sensitivity of both to high temperatures.

However, most approaches include only a small subset of the available information, and many ignore smaller-scale processes such as growth, fecundity and dispersal. Furthermore, different approaches often produce divergent predictions with no simple method to reconcile them. Here, we present a flexible framework for integrating models at multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian methods. LocationEastern North America (as an example). MethodsOur framework builds a metamodel that is constrained by the results of multiple sub-models and provides probabilistic estimates of species presence. We applied our approach to a simulated dataset to demonstrate the integration of a correlative SDM with a theoretical model. In a second example, we built an integrated model combining the results of a physiological model with presence-absence data for sugar maple (Acer saccharum), an abundant tree native to eastern North America. ResultsFor both examples, the integrated models successfully included information from all data sources and substantially improved the characterization of uncertainty. For the second example, the integrated model outperformed the source models with respect to uncertainty when modelling the present range of the species. When projecting into the future, the model provided a consensus view of two models that differed substantially in their predictions. Uncertainty was reduced where the models agreed and was greater where they diverged, providing a more realistic view of the state of knowledge than either source model. Main conclusionsWe conclude by discussing the potential applications of our method and its accessibility to applied ecologists. In ideal cases, our framework can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf software. The framework has wide potential for use in species distribution modelling and can drive better integration of multi-source and multi-scale data into ecological decision-making.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016; /C-2587-2009; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Strigul, Nick/C-3987-2016","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; /0000-0003-2006-1559; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Boulangeat, Isabelle/0000-0002-8463-7046; Talluto, Matthew/0000-0001-5188-7332; Solarik, Kevin/0000-0002-0198-0595; Lienard, Jean/0000-0003-4279-4980",Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [430393-12]; European Research Council under the European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [281422],"We acknowledge funding from the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science as well as NSERC strategic grant 430393-12.

However, trade-offs can occur between biodiversity and ecosystems services. We examine whether such trade-offs can be resolved through landscape-scale approaches to management. We analysed the biodiversity value and provision of selected ecosystem services (carbon storage, recreation, aesthetic and timber value) on patches of lowland heathland in the southern English county of Dorset. We used transition matrices of vegetation dynamics across 112 heathland patches to forecast biodiversity and ecosystem service provision on patches of different sizes over a 27-year timeline. Management scenarios simulated the removal of scrub and woodland and compared (i) no management (NM); (ii) all heaths managed equally (AM); and management focused on (iii) small heaths (SM) and (iv) large heaths (LM). Results highlighted a number of trade-offs. Whereas biodiversity values were significantly lower in woodland than in dry and humid heath, timber, carbon storage and aesthetic values were highest in woodland. While recreation value was positively related to dry heath area, it was negatively related to woodland area. Multicriteria analysis ranked NM highest for aesthetic value, carbon storage and timber value. In contrast, SM ranked highest for recreation and LM highest for biodiversity value. In no scenario did the current site-based approach to management (AM) rank highest.Synthesis and applications. Biodiversity-ecosystem service trade-offs are reported in lowland heathland, an ecosystem type of high conservation value. Trade-offs can be addressed through a landscape-scale approach to management, by varying interventions according to heathland patch size. Specifically, if management for biodiversity conservation is focused on larger patches, the aesthetic, carbon storage and timber value of smaller patches would increase, as a result of woody succession. In this way, individual heathland patches of either relatively high biodiversity value or high value for provision of ecosystem services could both potentially be delivered at the landscape scale.",,,,"Rose, Robert/J-5744-2012; Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Clarke, Ralph T/B-3859-2009","Rose, Robert/0000-0001-9993-5743; ","Natural Environment Research Council/Bournemouth University postgraduate studentship; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [ceh020009, ceh020005, ceh020004]","We thank a variety of landowners for access to field sites, Dorset Environment Records Centre for species location data.

Improving the water resources management in the basin requires accurate seasonal precipitation forecasts. Based on previous research, possible predictors of precipitation were selected and either downloaded directly or calculated using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 or NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) V3b data. Predictors were correlated with precipitation data, provided by the National Climate Centre of the China Meteorological Administration for the period 1961 to 2010 and averaged over the subbasins of the Tarim River. The Spearman rank correlation analyses with lead times of up to six months (or two seasons) revealed significant (at the 1% level) and strong (rho <= -0.6 or rho >= 0.6) correlations of precipitation in all subbasins with the SST and monsoon indices as well as with the Siberian High Intensity (SHI) and the Westerly Circulation Index (WCI).

They are captured by directed commercial and recreational fisheries (the latter of which often promote catch and release) or as incidental catch or bycatch in commercial fisheries. Population assessments of pelagic fishes typically incorporate catch-per-unit-effort time-series data from commercial and recreational fisheries; however, there have been notable changes in target species, areas fished and depth-specific gear deployments over the years that may have affected catchability. Some regional fisheries management organizations take into account the effects of time-and area-specific changes in the behaviours of fish and fishers, as well as fishing gear, to standardize catch-per-unit-effort indices and refine population estimates. However, estimates of changes in stock size over time may be very sensitive to underlying assumptions of the effects of oceanographic conditions and prey distribution on the horizontal and vertical movement patterns and distribution of pelagic fishes. Effective management and successful conservation of pelagic fishes requires a mechanistic understanding of their physiological and behavioural responses to environmental variability, potential for interaction with commercial and recreational fishing gear, and the capture process. The interdisciplinary field of conservation physiology can provide insights into pelagic fish demography and ecology (including environmental relationships and interspecific interactions) by uniting the complementary expertise and skills of fish physiologists and fisheries scientists. The iterative testing by one discipline of hypotheses generated by the other can span the fundamental-applied science continuum, leading to the development of robust insights supporting informed management. The resulting species-specific understanding of physiological abilities and tolerances can help to improve stock assessments, develop effective bycatch-reduction strategies, predict rates of post-release mortality, and forecast the population effects of environmental change. In this synthesis, we review several examples of these interdisciplinary collaborations that currently benefit pelagic fisheries management.",,,,,"Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659",NOAA Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science CenterNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; NSF Educational Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ocean Tracking Network Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"A.Z.H. acknowledges support from the NOAA Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center and NSF Educational Partnership in Climate Change and Sustainability.

This work often focuses on two very different scales of approach: the impacts of environmental change on individual organisms and their physiological vulnerability; and large-scale, biogeographic shifts in patterns of species distributions. While both scales of research are important and potentially informative of one another, with a few key exceptions, biogeographic (large scale) and physiological (small scale) approaches often operate in isolation from one another. There is a general consensus that a better understanding of mechanistic drivers will likely improve our ability to develop a more predictive framework. To this end, experimental and theoretical research has begun to tease apart the complexities of how changes in climate (as reflected in weather) ultimately translate into changes in growth, survival, productivity, species distribution and abundances, and the provision of ecosystem services. Yet, considerable debate still remains over how much detail is required to make effective predictions. Many authors have raised concerns about the implicit assumptions inherent in biological forecasts and while we cannot wait for perfect models before acting, oversimplifications can lead to unintended consequences. Additionally, what makes one forecasting method ""good enough"" or one approach ""better"" than another may depend largely on the application to which the predictions are being made. This review explores and summarizes the concerns raised by researchers working on problems at diverse scales and offers suggestions of how cross-scale research can best avoid potential pitfalls while preparing society for the ongoing impacts of climate change.",,,,"Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019","Kordas, Rebecca/0000-0002-9121-3452",,,,,11,11,3,25,,,,0065-2504,,978-0-12-811095-9; 978-0-08-100935-2,ADV ECOL RES,Adv.

In Kazakhstan the desertification (ecosystem degradation) is recognized as one of the key problems of the Republic. It is counted that in Kazakhstan there are 179,9 million hectares of the desertified land or about 66 percent of all territory of Kazakhstan are exposed to degradation processes. The main reason of desertification is cattle grazing. Due to the sharp falling of cattle livestock after 1992-1993, the pastures plant has been restored. The processes of rehabilitation of pastures and reduction of desertification have not been investigated yet. Therefore for the first time we have carried out the researches on the real situation of desertification of the territory from 2003 to 2016 on the external, easily observed sign - process of the vegetation rehabilitation. The received results can be accepted as the control, when assessing the level of degradation of the foothills of Kazakhstan. Besides, the obtained data can be taken into consideration in the processes of developing plans and prospects of economic and social development, schemes of land management, regional planning, territorial complex schemes for protection of the natural environment, working drafts of development or improvement of lands. Methods The rehabilitation processes are investigated by two methods: 1) mapping of microcenosis on the fixed profiles. On the profiles were assessed rehabilitation microcenosis in the communities, i.e. changes of the horizontal uniformity of the community - structure and nature of mosaicity. 2) assessment of changes on linear profiles - ecotones. In the method of ecotones separate methods of synchronous-phase indication are applied. The method of ecotones considerably reduces the time for carrying out ecological profiling, is rather effective for search forecasting and it is successfully applied by us in works on assessment of stability of ecosystems. Various materials - the published literature, maps and atlases, stock reports with schematic maps and thematic maps have been studied and analyzed. Besides, we used the data on social indicators in combination with physical and biological indicators as the processes studied with their help have the complex, interconnected character. The climatic indicators, relief, hydrographic network of the territory of Kurti district in Almaty region were considered when studying the dynamic processes taking place in the plant cover. When studying vegetation it was determined the species composition of communities, the projective covering of the soil with plants, the herbage height, its development and quantity of the control species of plants - degradation indicators. Besides, we plan to apply the remote sensing technology, effectively and regularly scanning the extensive territories by computer; the same territories can be selectively, more precisely studied on the earth. Result The digression - demutation schemes are made on the results of soil-geobotanic researches and analysis of soil-geobotanic materials of researches of the previous years. It has been found out that nowadays in the strongly degraded pastures ecosystems there are intensive processes of restoration of the soil-vegetable components of ecosystems (about 80% of the degraded pastures were restored).Sharp reduction of the cattle livestock was evident in the processes of plant restoration.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,4,,,,1314-2704,,978-619-7105-66-7,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,195,208,,,,,,"Ecology; Engineering, Environmental",,,WOS:000391519600026,,,,,

In this connection special urgency take the study of anthropogenic transformation in small rivers basins for installation according to changes in the major catchment basins. The aim of the research was the evaluation of the ecological state of natural waters on the example of the small rivers land Saarland (Germany). The hydrochemical monitoring data were obtained from autonomous automated stations that are located on the rivers Bist and Rossel. We investigated the following correlation dependencies between such combinations of natural waters quality parameters: total phosphorus and orthophosphates; ammonium and Ph; nitrates and conductivity; oxygen and total organic carbon. In this study we used the method of correlative analysis. Monitoring data are processed using software MS Excel; correlation dependence was defined using the CORREL. Correlation value is changed in the range from -1 to + 1 that demonstrates the indirect and direct dependence between the selected parameters. If the value is closer to +1, this means the presence of a strong connection, if closer to 0 weak. The negative correlation coefficient means the presence of the opposite connection. The time periods for the calculation of the correlation between the parameters of natural waters quality is selected: 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours respectively. The following time periods allow the best to trace and predict changes in the natural aquatic environment. Using correlation analysis we revealed that the increase of the ortophosphates concentration in the water due erosion processes from agricultural soils with fallouts. Ortophosphates are major nutrients for algae and increasing its concentration leads to intensification of the water eutrophication processes. Excess concentration of nitrates is associated with a high amount of raw sewage. Regularity was discovered, which proves that the dependence of the electrical conductivity from the nitrates concentration has a maximum, and then increase the concentration of the ones leads to a decrease of conductivity. This bond is confirmation of the Onsager equation. We obtained the dependence of total organic carbon content increase that the concentration exceeds the MPC from the concentration of oxygen. The method of correlative analysis gives the opportunity to control the processes that occur in natural waters, in particular for finding dependencies, laws and their interpretation, explanation of causation and the respective forecasts. Installed and validated correlations may to be used not only for the study of rivers Bist and Rossel, as well as for any natural water environments.",,,,"Pohrebennyk, Volodymyr/V-8035-2017; Mitryasova, Olena/L-4705-2018","Pohrebennyk, Volodymyr/0000-0002-1491-2356; Mitryasova, Olena/0000-0002-9107-4448",,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,1314-2704,,978-619-7105-66-7,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,317,324,,,,,,"Ecology; Engineering, Environmental",,,WOS:000391519600041,,,,,
