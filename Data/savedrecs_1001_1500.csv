We consider the soils as a natural filter, and this is justified by the calculations of the kinetic of formation of different forms of compounds in vertical and lateral migration flows. The process of dispersion of the hydrocarbon pollution is multidirectional in space and time and it is characterized by various speeds of mobilization, immobilization and remobilization of hydrocarbons. The synergetic basis of the mechanical and diffuse forms of the migration of the hydrocarbon pollution is presented in the models as an interaction between the initial liquid-phase, water-soluble, exchange and fixed forms of hydrocarbons.

Nowadays the oil industry is the main sector of the economy of Western Siberia, being at the same time the main polluter of the natural environment. Soil contamination occurs at the stages of geological exploration, development and operation of the fields and transportation of the oil produced. During the work process contaminants can extend beyond the production site and accumulate in intact ecological systems thus leading to their contamination. These facts emphasize the need for continuous environmental monitoring in the areas adjacent to the areas of oil production. The aim of the given work was to determine the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the state of the soil cover in the oil producing areas of southern taiga zone of Western Siberia. The main objectives of the study of ecological state of the soil cover are: registration of the current (background) level of pollution, monitoring changes in the chemical composition and their forecast, assessment of the possible consequences of soil contamination. The research technique included field, laboratory and office work. The method of route studies was applied while performing the field stage in order to examine the basic characteristics of the natural environment and the level of anthropogenic impact, whereas the method of testing was used for soil sampling and laboratory analysis. The laboratory work was related to the determination of contaminants concentration in the soil samples. The office work was reduced to processing the field data and chemical analysis results. The withdrawal of the soil samples was carried out from the surface layer of soil by the method of ""envelope"" at six sites. The samples were analized by 27 indicators. The study of the soil samples defined excess of the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) for sulphate, chloride, lead, zinc, manganese and phenols in the range from 1.22 to 18.30 shares of the MAC. Excess concentration of metals is both characteristic of the soils of the taiga zone of Western Siberia and of the industrial development of the territory. Studying the chemical analysis data it can be concluded that the soil within the investigated sites can be characterized as ""acceptable"" at five out of the six sites. The sixth site of the soil is ""moderately hazardous"".

As a result the constants of BaP half-destruction (T50) and coefficients of BaP accumulation in a pollutant plants were calculated in the chernozem soil at different levels of pollution. Correlation dependences of these indicators on initial concentration of BaP in the soil were established. Further these characteristics will allow to create model of transformation of BaP and other the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in chernozem soils of a steppe zone. The main features of accumulation, migrations and transformations of BaP under natural conditions were conducted.

Appearances of freak waves in the normal sea states are just such events. To reduce their potential destruction of marine structures, a forecast model is studied to predict whether freak waves occur in the wave propagation. In this model, the modified fourth-order nonlinear Schrodinger equation is employed as the deep-water wave model, which controls the evolution of complex wave envelopes. The measured wave train is set as its initial condition which needs to be changed into its corresponding complex wave envelope by use of the Hilbert transform method to be input into the wave model. During the evolution of complex wave envelope, its corresponding wave heights are estimated and compared with the definition of freak waves. If a freak wave is captured, its occurrence position and time are given. Three cases of observed, simulated and laboratory wave trains as initial conditions are performed to predict the generation of freak waves.

The objective of this study is to investigate how 10 years of lowered water table depths of wet floodplain ecosystems would affect CO2 fluxes measured using a closed chamber system, focusing on the role of long-term changes in soil thermal characteristics and vegetation community structure. Drainage diminishes the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of organic soil, leading to warmer soil temperatures in shallow layers during the daytime and colder soil temperatures in deeper layers, resulting in a reduction in thaw depths. These soil temperature changes can intensify growing-season heterotrophic respiration by up to 95 %. With decreased autotrophic respiration due to reduced gross primary production under these dry conditions, the differences in ecosystem respiration rates in the present study were 25 %. We also found that a decade-long drainage installation significantly increased shrub abundance, while decreasing Eriophorum angustifolium abundance resulted in Carex sp. dominance. These two changes had opposing influences on gross primary production during the growing season: while the increased abundance of shrubs slightly increased gross primary production, the replacement of E. angustifolium by Carex sp. significantly decreased it. With the effects of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production combined, net CO2 uptake rates varied between the two years, which can be attributed to Carex-dominated plots' sensitivity to climate. However, underlying processes showed consistent patterns: 10 years of drainage increased soil temperatures in shallow layers and replaced E. angustifolium by Carex sp., which increased CO2 emission and reduced CO2 uptake rates. During the non-growing season, drainage resulted in 4 times more CO2 emissions, with high sporadic fluxes; these fluxes were induced by soil temperatures, E. angustifolium abundance, and air pressure.",,,,"Goeckede, Mathias/C-1027-2017; Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016","Goeckede, Mathias/0000-0003-2833-8401; Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113; Kwon, Min Jung/0000-0002-7330-2320; Zimov, Sergey/0000-0002-0053-6599","European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [282700, PCIG12-GA-2012-333796]; German Ministry of Education and Research (CarboPerm-Project, BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [03G0836G]; International Max Planck Research School for Global Biogeochemical Cycles (IMPRS-gBGC); AXA Research Fund [PDOC_2012_W2 campaign]","This work has been supported by the European Commission (PAGE21 project, FP7-ENV-2011, grant agreement no. 282700, and PerCCOM project, FP7-PEOPLE-2012-CIG, grant agreement no.

Using high-resolution remote-sensing imagery, and the Maxent model, we analysed the current distribution and forecast future distribution of L. chinensis under two climate change scenarios, IPCC A2 and IPCC B2. The results showed that three dominant climatic factors influenced the geographic distribution of L. chinensis: mean annual temperature, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, and precipitation of wettest month. Currently, L. chinensis mainly concentrated at 3100 m and covers an area of 53.52 km(2). The population on the southern slope covers approximately twice the area of that on the northern slope; the model simulations indicated that the area of suitable habitat would decrease continually under two climate change scenarios, A2 and B2; the decrease was more obvious in scenario A2, and the range in scenario A2 covers approximately twice the area of that in scenario B2.

To this end, 2-year simulations of the Chesapeake Bay from eight hydrodynamic-oxygen models have been statistically compared to each other and to historical monitoring data. Results show that although models have difficulty resolving the variables typically thought to be the main drivers of dissolved oxygen variability (stratification, nutrients, and chlorophyll), all eight models have significant skill in reproducing the mean and seasonal variability of dissolved oxygen. In addition, models with constant net respiration rates independent of nutrient supply and temperature reproduced observed dissolved oxygen concentrations about as well as much more complex, nutrient-dependent biogeochemical models. This finding has significant ramifications for short-term hypoxia forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, which may be possible with very simple oxygen parameterizations, in contrast to the more complex full biogeochemical models required for scenario-based forecasting. However, models have difficulty simulating correct density and oxygen mixed layer depths, which are important ecologically in terms of habitat compression. Observations indicate a much stronger correlation between the depths of the top of the pycnocline and oxycline than between their maximum vertical gradients, highlighting the importance of the mixing depth in defining the region of aerobic habitat in the Chesapeake Bay when low-oxygen bottom waters are present. Improvement in hypoxia simulations will thus depend more on the ability of models to reproduce the correct mean and variability of the depth of the physically driven surface mixed layer than the precise magnitude of the vertical density gradient.",,,,"Li, Ming/B-3485-2015","Li, Ming/0000-0003-1492-4127; Friedrichs, Carl/0000-0002-1810-900X; Friedrichs, Marjorie/0000-0003-2828-7595; Bever, Aaron/0000-0002-2196-0831",NOAA IOOS program,This work was supported by the NOAA IOOS program as part of the Coastal Ocean Modeling Testbed.

Invasive shrubs and fire suppression have led to increased densification and biomass accumulation in forest ecosystems of the southeastern USA. Notably, Chinese and European privets are rapid growing, shade-tolerant shrubs which number among the most aggressive invasive species in these forests. Privet encroachment has caused losses of native diversity, alteration of ecosystem processes and changes in community structure. The latter has become manifest through decreases in fine herbaceous fuels concurrent with increases in coarse woody fuels in forest understoreys. These alterations in fuel structure will potentially lead to less frequent, but more severe forest fires, which threaten important forest resources during extreme weather conditions. Drawing on extensive data sets compiled by the US Forest Service, we integrated statistical forecasting and analytical techniques within a spatially explicit, agent-based, simulation framework to predict potential range expansion of Chinese and European privet (Ligustrum sinense and L. vulgare) and the associated increase in crown fire risk over the next two decades in forestlands of Mississippi and Alabama. Our results indicate that probability of invasion is positively associated with elevation, adjacency (within 300 m) to water bodies, mean daily maximum temperature, site productivity and private land ownership, and is negatively associated with slope, stand age, artificial regeneration, distance to the nearest road and fire disturbance. Our projections suggest the total area invaded will increase from 1.36 to approximate to 31.39% of all forestlands in Mississippi and Alabama (approximate to 7 million hectares) and the annual frequency of crown fires in these forestlands will approximately double within the next two decades. Such time series projections of annual range expansions and crown fire frequency should provide land managers and restoration practitioners with an invasion chronology upon which to base proactive management plans.",,,,,"Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan/0000-0002-7850-0406",,,,,4,3,2,24,,,,2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2016,8,,,,,,,,plw012,10.1093/aobpla/plw012,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology,,,WOS:000376446700005,26903488,,,,

Monitoring and control efforts often rely on scientific knowledge of suitable habitat for the invasive species. However, rising temperatures and altered precipitation projected with climate change are likely to shift the geographic range of that suitable habitat. Here, we review experimental and modeling studies of climatic limits to exotic annual Bromus (Bromus hereafter) distribution in the Intermountain West in the context of projections of future climate change. We update empirical models of range shifts to test whether Bromus rubens L. (red brome) is likely to expand into ranges that become less suitable for Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass or downy brome). Warming temperatures are likely to create an advantage for Bromus species throughout much of the Intermountain West, potentially enhancing invasion into formerly resistant ecosystems if native species mortality increases with warming and drought. Bromus rubens is likely to expand into areas of the Southern Great Basin and Colorado Plateau as warmer winters reduce range constraints caused by cold intolerance. However, a primary limitation to exotic annual Bromus invasion and expansion is growing season precipitation. Projections for precipitation change are uncertain, but increased precipitation during periods critical for exotic annual Bromus germination and growth is forecast for the Northern Great Basin. Increased Bromus reproduction and biomass may exacerbate B. tectorum invasion and associated fire risk, especially if coupled with longer fire seasons and more extreme fire weather. Managers should anticipate both shifts in the overall distribution of Bromus species, as well as changes in relative abundance within its existing range.",,,,"Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008","Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971",,,,,28,28,2,30,,,,0172-6161,,978-3-319-24930-8; 978-3-319-24928-5,SPRINGER SER ENV MAN,Springer Ser.

However, information on the mean and variation of size distributions often confound one another when relating body size to aggregate functioning. Given that size-based metrics are used as indicators of ecosystem status, it is important to identify the specific aspects of size distributions that mediate ecosystem functioning. Our goal was to simultaneously account for the mean, variance, and shape of size distributions when relating body size to aggregate ecosystem functioning. We take advantage of habitat-specific differences in size distributions to estimate nutrient recycling by a non-native crayfish using mean-field and variance-incorporating approaches. Crayfishes often substantially influence ecosystem functioning through their omnivorous role in aquatic food webs. As predicted from Jensen's inequality, considering only the mean body size of crayfish overestimated aggregate effects on ecosystem functioning. This bias declined with mean body size such that mean-field and variance- incorporating estimates of ecosystem functioning were similar for samples at mean body sizes >7.5 g. At low mean body size, mean-field bias in ecosystem functioning mismatch predictions from Jensen's inequality, likely because of the increasing skewness of the size distribution. Our findings support the prediction that variance around the mean can alter the relationship between body size and ecosystem functioning, especially at low mean body size. However, methods to account for mean-field bias performed poorly in samples with highly skewed distributions, indicating that changes in the shape of the distribution, in addition to the variance, may confound mean-based estimates of ecosystem functioning. Given that many biological functions scale allometrically, explicitly defining and experimentally or statistically isolating the effects of the mean, variance, and shape of size distributions is necessary to begin generalizing relationships between animal body size and ecosystem functioning.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010",,"National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); H.

At small scales, ecological processes driving plant invasions are expected to produce a spatially explicit pattern driven by propagule pressure and local ground heterogeneity. Our aim was to determine the interplay between the intensity of seed rain, using distance to a mature plantation as a proxy, and microsite heterogeneity in the spreading of Pinus contorta in the treeless Patagonian steppe. Three one-hectare plots were located under different degrees of P.contorta invasion (Coyhaique Alto, 45 degrees 30S and 71 degrees 42W). We fitted three types of inhomogeneous Poisson models to each pine plot in an attempt for describing the observed pattern as accurately as possible: the dispersal models, local ground heterogeneity models, and combined models, using both types of covariates. To include the temporal axis in the invasion process, we analyzed both the pattern of young and old recruits and also of all recruits together. As hypothesized, the spatial patterns of recruited pines showed coarse scale heterogeneity. Early pine invasion spatial patterns in our Patagonian steppe site is not different from expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes taking into consideration a linear and negative dependency of pine recruit intensity on the distance to afforestations. Models including ground-cover predictors were able to describe the point pattern process only in a couple of cases but never better than dispersal models. This finding concurs with the idea that early invasions depend more on seed pressure than on the biotic and abiotic relationships seed and seedlings establish at the microsite scale. Our results show that without a timely and active management, P.contorta will invade the Patagonian steppe independently of the local ground-cover conditions.",,,,"Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010; de la Cruz, Marcelino/M-6124-2015; Pauchard, Anibal/B-5034-2008","Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020; de la Cruz, Marcelino/0000-0002-9080-4525; Pauchard, Anibal/0000-0003-1284-3163; Invasiones Biologicas, Laboratorio/0000-0003-3475-919X","FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1100792, 1140485]; Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity [ICM P05-002]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PFB-23]; project ISLAS - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2009-13190-C03-02]; project MOUNTAINS - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2012-38427]; Comunidad de MadridComunidad de MadridInstituto de Salud Carlos III","Study funded by Fondecyt grants 1100792 & 1140485 and the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity grants ICM P05-002 and CONICYT PFB-23.

The Natura 2000 network (N2000) constitutes a major milestone in biodiversity conservation in Europe, but the degree to which this static network will be able to reach its long-term conservation objectives raises concern. We assessed the changes in the effectiveness of N2000 in a Mediterranean ecosystem between 2000 and 2050 under different combinations of climate and land cover change scenarios. LocationCatalonia, Spain. MethodsPotential distribution changes of several terrestrial bird species of conservation interest included in the European Union's Birds Directive were predicted within an ensemble-forecasting framework that hierarchically integrated climate change and land cover change scenarios. Land cover changes were simulated using a spatially explicit fire-succession model that integrates fire management strategies and vegetation encroachment after the abandonment of cultivated areas as the main drivers of landscape dynamics in Mediterranean ecosystems. ResultsOur results suggest that the amount of suitable habitats for the target species will strongly decrease both inside and outside N2000. However, the effectiveness of N2000 is expected to increase in the next decades because the amount of suitable habitats is predicted to decrease less inside than outside this network. Main conclusionsSuch predictions shed light on the key role that the current N2000may play in the near future and emphasize the need for an integrative conservation perspective wherein agricultural, forest and fire management policies should be considered to effectively preserve key habitats for threatened birds in fire-prone, highly dynamic Mediterranean ecosystems.

Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) exert strong effects on plants in tropical savannas, and many wild LMH populations are declining. However, predicting the impacts of these declines on vegetation structure remains challenging. 2. Experiments suggest that tree cover can increase rapidly following LMH exclusion. Yet it is unclear whether these results scale up to predict ecosystem-level impacts of LMH declines, which often alter fire regimes, trigger compensatory responses of other herbivores and accompany anthropogenic land-use changes. Moreover, theory predicts that grazers and browsers should have opposing effects on tree cover, further complicating efforts to forecast the outcomes of community-wide declines. 3. We used the near-extirpation of grazing and browsing LMH from Gorongosa National Park during the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) as a natural experiment to test whether megafaunal collapse increased tree cover. We classified herbaceous and tree cover in satellite images taken (a) at the onset of war in 1977 and (b) in 2012, two decades after hostilities ceased. 4. Throughout the 3620-km(2) park, proportional tree cover increased by 34% (from 0.29 to 0.39) an addition of 362 km(2). Four of the park's five major habitat zones (including miombo woodland, Acacia-Combretum-palm savanna, and floodplain grassland) showed even greater increases in tree cover (51-134%), with an average increase of 94% in ecologically critical Rift Valley habitats. Only in the eastern Cheringoma Plateau, which had historically low wildlife densities, did tree cover decrease (by 5%). 5. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that reduced browsing pressure enhanced tree growth, survival and/or recruitment; we found no directional trends in rainfall or fire that could explain increased tree cover. 6. Synthesis. Catastrophic large-herbivore die-offs in Mozambique's flagship national park were followed by 35 years of woodland expansion, most severely in areas where pre-war wildlife biomass was greatest. These findings suggest that browsing release supersedes grazer-grass-fire feedbacks in governing ecosystem-level tree cover, consistent with smaller-scale experimental results, although the potentially complementary effect of CO2 fertilization cannot be definitively ruled out. Future work in Gorongosa will reveal whether recovering LMH populations reverse this trend, or alternatively whether woody encroachment hinders ongoing restoration efforts.",,,,,"Stalmans, Marc/0000-0001-9779-6292",Gorongosa Restoration Project; US National Science Foundation DDIG grant [DEB-1501306]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1355122]; Greg Carr Foundation; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [9291]; Princeton University's Grand Challenges programme; Greg Carr,"We thank the Mozambican government and Gorongosa NP for permission to conduct this research.

Knowing that alpine treelines have shown contrasting responses to climate change, we determined the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic factors involved in seedling survival and growth. LocationMcGerrigle Mountains, Parc National de la Gaspesie, Appalachian Range, eastern Quebec, Canada. MethodsIn two white spruce (Picea glauca) treeline sites, we used the microclimate in the vicinity of tree islands, densely packed clusters of trees isolated from each other by alpine tundra vegetation, to assess the effects of abiotic variables (sum of degree days [DD], snowpack duration and a wind exposure index) as well as the effects of biotic interactions with neighbouring vegetation on the survival and growth of transplanted white spruce seedlings. For 3yr, we surveyed seedling survival twice a year to discriminate between winter and summer survival, and measured seedling growth at the end of each growing season. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the relative effects of covariates on survival and growth. ResultsSurvival probability decreased in microsites where winter DD was high, and increased in microsites with longer snowpack duration. In wind-exposed microsites, seedling survival increased when neighbouring vegetation was present, indicating facilitative mechanisms. Seedling growth was positively affected by the duration of snow cover and tended to increase with higher DD during the previous year. In wind-sheltered microsites, seedling growth tended to be negatively affected by neighbouring vegetation, indicating competitive mechanisms. ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that seedling establishment is more sensitive to winter conditions, notably to the length of snow cover (which protects seedlings from frost and desiccation), than to summer temperature. Biotic interactions increased seedling establishment when environmental stresses were higher. We suggest that regional-scale factors such as winter climate and biotic interactions should be included in modelling exercises to improve future treeline location forecasts.",,,,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs; Center of Forest Research,"Funding for this project was provided by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Discovery grant (to EJBM), the Canada Research Chair (to EJBM) and the Center of Forest Research (www.cef-cfr.ca) for a visiting scientist grant to AF.

This network could include: wireless mobile sensors deployed by first responders in hazardous material operations, stationary sensors used to protect an area against accidental, or intentional, contaminations or stationary air quality monitoring stations. The objective of the network is the estimation (localization - quantification) of releases sources. The design of such a network has an important issue in determining the optimal placement of sensors. This paper presents the first application of the renormalized data assimilation method to address this issue. It is associated with a classical optimization algorithm (simulate annealing) to solve the combinatory optimization problem consisting of finding the optimal configuration of m sensors among a set of n potential positions. Three scenarios, corresponding with three different cost functions, are proposed. The first one consists of optimizing the design of a network deployed in emergency situations. Experimental data from a wind tunnel experiment are used. The objective is to characterize the source to minimize error in measurement forecasts. The second one is to optimize the design of the same network but in a situation where the source can be anywhere in the domain. To that end, an entropic criterion is used. The last one consists of optimizing the design of a stationary network. The objective is to characterize the source with varying meteorological conditions (experimental meteorological data are used).",,,,,"Turbelin, Gregory/0000-0001-9929-3090",,,,,2,2,0,0,,,,1743-3541,,978-1-78466-130-4; 978-1-78466-129-8,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

The main driver for this research focus has been the fisheries' requirements for stock forecasting and conservation measures. Nowadays this is joined by concerns over climate change effects and the requirement to take a more holistic view to understand food web structures. So far, however, we do not have a clear understanding of the physiological response of krill and hence their adaptability to cope with ongoing environmental changes, caused by the anthropogenic carbon emissions. This is due to the extreme lack of intense studies on krill physiology, especially of their larval stages in relation to their seasonal environment. A major aim of this book chapter is on the one hand to summarize how physiological functions such as lipid accumulation and utilisation, metabolic activity and growth change with ontogeny and season and to demonstrate which environmental factors are the main drivers for seasonal variability of these functions in adult and larval krill. On the other hand, we draw the attention to the importance of photoperiod (day length) as an entrainment cue for endogenous rhythms and clocks in the life cycle of krill. Furthermore, we give an overview of the current knowledge on the impact of elevated seawater temperature and ocean acidification on krill.",,,,,,,,,,11,11,0,4,,,,2468-5712,,978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9,ADV POL ECO,,,2016,,,,,,,145,174,,10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_4,10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3,,,Biology; Ecology,,,WOS:000401843300005,,,,,

Given that organisms respond physiologically to stressors, such as temperature, in highly non-linear ways, small modelling errors in predictor variables can potentially result in failures to predict mortality or severe stress, especially if an organism exists near its physiological limits. As a result, a central challenge facing ecologists, particularly those attempting to forecast future responses to environmental change, is how to develop metrics of forecast model skill (the ability of a model to predict defined events) that are biologically meaningful and reflective of underlying processes. We quantified the skill of four simple models of body temperature (a primary determinant of physiological stress) of an intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus, using common metrics of model performance, such as root mean square error, as well as forecast verification skill scores developed by the meteorological community. We used a physiologically grounded framework to assess each model's ability to predict optimal, sub-optimal, sub-lethal and lethal physiological responses. Models diverged in their ability to predict different levels of physiological stress when evaluated using skill scores, even though common metrics, such as root mean square error, indicated similar accuracy overall. Results from this study emphasize the importance of grounding assessments of model skill in the context of an organism's physiology and, especially, of considering the implications of false-positive and false-negative errors when forecasting the ecological effects of environmental change.",,,,"Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019; Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414",National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX11AP77G],This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX11AP77G to B.H. and D.S.W.).,,,8,8,0,0,,,,2051-1434,,,CONSERV PHYSIOL,Conserv.

Climate warming often traps populations in smaller habitat fragments, not only changing biotic parameters, but potentially decreasing adaptive potential by decreasing genetic variability. We examined the ability of six genetically distinct and different-sized populations of a cold-water fish (brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis) to tolerate acute thermal warming and whether this tolerance could be altered by hybridizing populations. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) assays were conducted on juveniles from each population to assess thermal tolerance, and the agitation temperature was recorded for assessing behavioural changes to elevated temperatures. An additional metric, which we have called the 'CTmax-agitation window' (CTmax minus agitation temperature), was also assessed. The CTmax differed between five out of 15 population pairs, although the maximal CTmax difference was only 0.68 degrees C (29.11-29.79 degrees C). Hybridization between one large population and two small populations yielded no obvious heterosis in mean CTmax, and no differences in agitation temperature or CTmax-agitation window were detected among pure populations or hybrids. Summer variation in temperature within each stream was negatively correlated with mean CTmax and mean CTmax-agitation window, although the maximal difference was small. Despite being one of the most phenotypically divergent and plastic north temperate freshwater fishes, our results suggest that limited variability exists in CTmax among populations of brook trout, regardless of their population size, standing genetic variation and differing natural thermal regimes (temperature variation, minimum and maximum).

We highlight here some of the most consolidated ones: long-term reconstructions from sedimentary lake records and cave speleothemes, the dynamics of one of the few active Iberian glaciers, the physico-chemical components of alpine streams, springs and lakes, the fingerprint of climatic change from ancient trees, changes in the composition and structure of biodiversity of alpine communities, natural and man-made grasslands at different altitudes, and the treeline, and population dynamics of endangered species or habitat indicators. The ecological monitoring shows that changes in both climate and land use, are having a strong influence in the physiognomy and structure of some of the most iconic and abundant habitats in the National Park. However, we found an important spatial variability in some processes, and also that others do not fit the established paradigms.

Over the last several decades a well-defined theory of complexity has emerged, integrating earlier (and inter-related) concepts based on bifurcation theory, catastrophe theory, and chaos theory. In this review, we trace aspects of the historical development of these ideas and their application to marine systems. The manifestations of nonlinear dynamics in marine ecosystems include regime shifts; mirage correlations in which causally-connected system components can appear to be in-phase, asynchronous, or anti-correlated over different stanzas of time; and related state-dependent behavior in which the response of a focal variable to a driver differs depending on the present state of the system. We describe the analytical underpinnings of each of these dynamical behaviors. Although nonlinear dynamical systems are often portrayed in a deterministic setting, we emphasize the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in which an underlying nonlinear system acts as a noise amplifier in the presence of random perturbations. We next review the tools available for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems based on the concept of state-space reconstruction and the application of techniques in nonlinear time series analysis. Finally, we address the management implications of nonlinear dynamics in exploited marine species and argue that considerations of predictability and forecast skill can serve as effective criteria for model selection and inference.",,,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,,,,2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal marshes become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). Plant growth responses to RSLR are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of SOM decomposition to accelerated RSLR. Here we quantified the effects of flooding depth and duration on SOM decomposition by exposing planted and unplanted field-based mesocosms to experimentally manipulated relative sea level over two consecutive growing seasons. SOM decomposition was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated via (CO2)-C-13. Despite the dominant paradigm that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM decomposition in the absence of plants was not sensitive to flooding depth and duration. The presence of plants had a dramatic effect on SOM decomposition, increasing SOM-derived CO2 flux by up to 267% and 125% (in 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to unplanted controls in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, plant stimulation of SOM decomposition was strongly and positively related to plant biomass and in particular aboveground biomass. We conclude that SOM decomposition rates are not directly driven by relative sea level and its effect on oxygen diffusion through soil, but indirectly by plant responses to relative sea level. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for models of SOM accumulation and surface elevation change in response to accelerated RSLR.",,,,"Jensen, Kai/L-6657-2015","Jensen, Kai/0000-0002-0543-070X; Mueller, Peter/0000-0001-6974-5498; Megonigal, Patrick/0000-0002-2018-7883",Smithsonian Institution's Graduate Student Fellowship Program; University of Hamburg; Student Research Grant Program of the Society of Wetland Scientists; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; NSF-LTREB Program [DEB-0950080]; Maryland Sea Grant [SA7528114-WW]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-97ER62458],"We thank J.

Here we present the first global assessment of current and potential future impacts on biodiversity of a habitat loss and fragmentation-climate change (HLF-CC) interaction. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the negative impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation have been disproportionately severe in areas with high temperatures in the warmest month and declining rainfall, although impacts also varied across vegetation types. We compiled an integrated global database of past, current and future climate variables and past vegetation loss to identify ecoregions where (i) past climate change is most likely to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF, and (ii) forecasted climate change is most likely to exacerbate the impacts of HLF in the future. We found that recent climate change is likely (probability >66%) to have exacerbated the impacts of HLF in 120 (18.5%) ecoregions. Impacted ecoregions are disproportionately biodiverse, containing over half (54.1%) of all known terrestrial amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species. Forecasts from the RCP8.5 emissions scenario suggest that nearly half of ecoregions globally (n = 283, 43.5%) will become impacted during the 21st century. To minimize ongoing and future HLF-CC impacts on biodiversity, ecoregions where impacts are most likely must become priorities for proactive conservation actions that avoid loss of native vegetation (e.g., protected area establishment). Highly degraded ecoregions where impacts are most likely should be priorities for restoration and candidates for unconventional conservation actions (e.g. translocation of species).

While past events took place over thousands of years, current climate change is occurring much faster, over a few decades. We modelled the potential distribution area of bat species in the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savannah, and assessed the potential impacts of climate change up to 2050 in two scenarios. First we evaluated what the impact on the distributions of bat species would be if they were unable to move to areas where climate conditions might be similar to current ones. The novelty of our paper is that, based on least-cost-path analyses, we identified potential corridors that could be managed now to mitigate potential impacts of climate change. Our results indicate that on average, in the future bat species would find similar climate conditions 281 km southeast from current regions. If bat species were not able to move to new suitable areas and were unable to adapt, then 36 species (31.6%) could lose >= 80% of their current distribution area, and five species will lose more than 98% of their distribution area in the Brazilian Cerrado. In contrast, if bat species are able to reach such areas, then the number of highly impacted species will be reduced to nine, with none of them likely to disappear from the Cerrado. We present measures that could be implemented immediately to mitigate future climate change impacts. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This scheduling requires the prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo), which has been performed in some areas by using the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) equation or the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation with all of the required parameters obtained from forecasting services. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and HS, which use forecasted daily maximum and minimum temperatures (T-MAX and T-MIN) as input data, were used to forecast ETo from 2011 to 2012 using PM as the reference methodology. A tool named FORETo (ETo forecasting) was implemented to transfer the proposed methodology to final users. This methodology and FORETo software were applied in the Hydro-geologic System 08.29 (Spain), where there is a high concentration of crops with high water consumption in semi-arid conditions. Two seasons of weekly field observations were collected to analyse the ability of FORETo to predict maize and onion crop water requirements. The results obtained from the comparison of daily ETo forecasts by FORETo and HS versus PM showed a better performance of the developed model. However, HS had good agreement, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.98 mm day(-1) and an index of agreement (d) higher than 0.95. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This research utilizes the land transformation model (LTM), an artificial neural networking mechanism in Geographic Information Systems, to forecast vacant land. Variable influence on vacant land prediction and accuracy of the LTM is assessed by comparing input factors and patterns, using time-series data from 1990 to 2010 in Fort Worth, Texas, USA.

Therefore, the issue of spatial design support systems (SDSS) is an extremely important, still expanding, field of research. The paper is embedded in a larger project of IT tool called FAST (Fast Simulation Tool), an original analytical model integrated with CAD software. The tool, through an object-oriented database and mechanisms of simulation, allows for both effective study of key parameters which influence the development ratio as well as its application in planning practice. It proposes a three-stage approach for the implementation in the planning process: the validation, giving a holistic balance of the key parameters for certain spatial planning entities, the simulation of the development process used for analysis and forecast, and finally, the clear evaluation of spatial scenario. In the outlined method, the paper is focused on the creation of the framework for evaluation of the planned housing development, based on collected data and prepared information. Although the general mechanism of FAST tool has already been presented in literature, the stage connected with the multi-criteria assessment requires a wider characterization. The difficult process of synthesis of quantitative and less precise quality description of spatial development in essential terms of economical, ecological and social topics, involves the incorporation of the tool in the planning procedures, both for professionals and other decision makers. The description of the methodology for the creation of evaluation framework embedded in the study of literature and implementations is an autonomous and significant worth exposing issue. It covers the operations research in SDSS with emphasis on formulation of decision variables, their substantiation and accuracy, and on the other hand flexibility of adaptation to different situation in spatial planning. Ultimately, the goals are to explain the root model, tools for its enhancement, and finally, to explain adjusted, expert model for the decision-making process in planning of residential areas, taking FAST as a principal framework.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,1743-3541,,978-1-78466-104-5; 978-1-78466-103-8,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

The modeling of the tower is done in three tools in order to reduce the error of estimations. This dwelling project is part of a Colombian government program for reducing the lack of dwellings in the social-economics stratum of low-income families. These dwellings are built in urban zones, they have total areas of between 40m(2) and 60m(2) on one or two levels and their cost is lower than USD 40,000. The energy sustainability of building depends mainly on passive solutions (daylighting and natural ventilation), although this consideration is very discrete in the architectural design of these social projects. Due to lack of land, many future projects will be built in towers of five levels. In order to estimate the life quality of users in these new kinds of dwellings, the Universidad Industrial de Santander has started an evaluation process of these towers according to the specific climate conditions of Bucaramanga. The building simulation tools used in this study are DesignBuilder, eQUEST and Ecotect for carrying out analyses like potential daylighting, thermal comfort and annual energy consumption. Results indicate that near to 70% of time (more of 6,000 hours per year) there are no conditions of thermal comfort and the inside temperature is at least 2 degrees C above ambient temperature, mainly during tropical sun-time (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), which is significant, considering the warm and humid climate of the city.

It further provides a measure of uncertainty in water resources forecasts by comparing the performance of two hydrological models: the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Regional Hydro-ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). Regional climate model outputs for the 2021-2050 time frame and hypothetical (but plausible) land-use scenarios considering re-vegetation and wildfire processes were used as inputs to the models. Results indicate an overall decrease in river flows (up to 30%, depending on the combination of scenarios) when the scenarios are considered, except for the post-fire vegetation scenario, in which streamflows are simulated to increase (between 2% and 10%). However, the magnitude of these projections varies between the two models used, as SWAT tends to produce larger hydrological changes under climate change scenarios and RHESSys shows more sensitivity to changes in land cover. The final prediction will therefore depend largely on the combination of the land-use and climate scenarios and on the model used.

Efforts to forecast the effects of SLR on coastal wetland vegetation communities should be useful in making predictions for individual species that depend upon those communities. However, considerable uncertainty exists when predicting a chain of events that passes from the global climate to local effects to implications for a single species. One component of this uncertainty is the classification resolution used by SLR landscape change models such as the Sea Level Affects Marshes Model (SLAMM). To isolate and assess the effects of this kind of uncertainty on species-level SLR prediction, we analyzed surveys of birds and plants in the lower Altamaha River and its estuary in Georgia, USA. For 19 marsh and forest bird species, we tested the predictive value of three classes of covariates of site occupancy: (1) field-measured habitat variables and spatial information, (2) information available from a SLAMM map, including the spatial configuration of the SLAMM habitat classes, and (3) SLAMM habitat class alone. We found that the predictive ability of occupancy models built from these three kinds of information varies widely among species. We therefore suggest criteria for classifying species according to the amount of detail necessary to describe their habitat niche, and thus to maximize the accuracy of predictive models. We point out that for species with habitat requirements that can be represented well by SLAMM classes, such as the Clapper Rail, forecasts of SLR-induced population change are probably feasible. For species with more narrow habitat needs, however, such as the Seaside Sparrow, reasonable predictions of SLR effects may not be possible without further refinement of SLR landscape change models. We suggest that improved thematic resolution of such models should be a priority, if the implications of SLR models for individual species are to be ascertained fully.",,,,,"Hunter, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4710-167X",NOAA National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System Graduate Research Fellowship at the Sapelo Island NERR; Georgia Ornithological Society,"Field hands Dan B.

Here, we review the functional roles of invertebrates commonly found within soils of rain gardens. Soil fauna have the potential to substantially alter plant growth, water infiltration rates, and the retention and removal of pathogens, nutrients, heavy metals and other contaminants. Their lack of inclusion in controlled laboratory or greenhouse studies may contribute to differences in observed function in field and laboratory settings. Promising future research directions include the following: (i) the use of controlled experiments to study invertebrate effects on rain garden function; (ii) determining the factors affecting variability in organismal abundance among and within sites; and (iii) the design of rain gardens to facilitate development of fauna that promote desired functions.Synthesis and applications.

However, according to ecological studies, their vulnerability might be less severe than initially thought. Thus, a realistic forecast of species survival and Antarctic biodiversity should be based on studies from a variety of species under consideration of ecological factors. The limpet Nacella concinna is often found in the rocky intertidal and sublittoral zones of the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent subantarctic islands. This review summarizes most of the available information on the biology of this limpet, one of the most conspicuous invertebrates of the intertidal zone. There is some evidence that adult N. concinna are physiologically flexible and can acclimate to 3 A degrees C. However, the requirements of the larval stage are poorly known, thus precluding realistic predictions of how elevated temperatures will affect N. concinna populations. Data on physiological performance (righting ability, tenacity and radula rasping rate) under different temperatures could provide a useful baseline for further field investigations on the effects of warming. The species could be used as model organism for investigating the biological effects of ongoing global warming on slow-growing Antarctic ectotherms.

It is especially important to understand the nature of this relationship regarding threatened species. The ability to forecast local densities over the geographic range of species provides a way to link population ecology and biogeography. Particularly, our aim was to test whether predictions derived from species distribution modelling data provide useful information on spatial patterns of abundance and, consequently, may act as surrogates for local density estimates. Location Andalusia (southern Spain). Methods Logistic regression and the favourability function were applied as modelling tools to presence-absence data to compare the predicted results with current abundance. This approach is useful in the identification of local priorities for the target species whenever broad-scale surveys need to be performed. Results The model included variables related to topography, vegetation and spatial location to explain the presence of Bonelli's eagle. A positive relationship was found between both probability and favourability and the density of this species, but a triangular fit only with favourability, suggesting that the physiological and ecological requirements of this species in the study area are better reflected in the favourability model.

Although high-latitude regions are expected to experience some of the greatest increases in temperature due to global warming, little is known on how individual responses in species will affect patterns in phylogenetic diversity (PD). Location Alberta, Canada. Method sWe used 160,589 occurrence records for 1541 species of seed plants in Alberta (nearly 90% of the province's seed flora) and ensemble niche models to project current and future suitable habitats. We then examined climate change vulnerability of individual species and the potential impacts of climate change on species richness, PD and both taxonomic and phylogenetic endemism (PE). We also assessed whether predicted losses of PD were distributed randomly across the plant tree of life. Results We found that 368 species (24%) may lose on average >80% of their current suitable climates (habitats), while 539 species (35%) were projected to more than double their current suitable range. Both species richness and PD were predicted to increase in most areas, except for the species-rich Rocky Mountains, which are predicted to experience future declines. Maps of taxonomic and PE identified several regions with high conservation value and climate change threat suggesting priorities for conservation and climate change adaptation. Overall, a non-random extinction risk was found for Alberta's flora, demonstrating potential future impacts of climate change on the loss of evolutionary history. Main conclusions Our analyses suggest that climate change will have asymmetrical effects on the distribution of Alberta's plant diversity and endemism and a non-random extinction risk of the current state of species evolutionary history.

Since climate predictions forecast an increase in both temperature and climate variability, both TGP and bet hedging are likely to become important strategies to mediate climate change effects. Here, the potential to produce variably sized offspring in both warming and unpredictable environments was tested by investigating whether stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) mothers adjusted mean offspring size and within-clutch variation in offspring size in response to experimental manipulation of maternal thermal environment and predictability (alternating between ambient and elevated water temperatures). Reproductive output traits of F1 females were influenced by both temperature and environmental predictability. Mothers that developed at ambient temperature (17 degrees C) produced larger, but fewer eggs than mothers that developed at elevated temperature (21 degrees C), implying selection for different-sized offspring in different environments. Mothers in unpredictable environments had smaller mean egg sizes and tended to have greater within-female egg size variability, especially at 21 degrees C, suggesting that mothers may have dynamically modified the variance in offspring size to spread the risk of incorrectly predicting future environmental conditions. Both TGP and diversification influenced F2 offspring body size. F2 offspring reared at 21 degrees C had larger mean body sizes if their mother developed at 21 degrees C, but this TGP benefit was not present for offspring of 17 degrees C mothers reared at 17 degrees C, indicating that maternal TGP will be highly relevant for ocean warming scenarios in this system. Offspring of variable environment mothers were smaller but more variable in size than offspring from constant environment mothers, particularly at 21 degrees C. In summary, stickleback mothers may have used both TGP and diversified bet-hedging strategies to cope with the dual stress of ocean warming and environmental uncertainty.",,,,"Shama, Lisa N S/K-7469-2017","Shama, Lisa N S/0000-0002-9017-9950",DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) Emmy NoetherGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [WE4641/1-1],"Many thanks to Kaibil Escobar Wolf for taking care of the fish, and to all members of the Coastal Ecological Genetics group for feeding fish on weekends.

The effect of climatic factors on diseases of predation-prone domestic animals and then on conflicts is unstudied, but potentially significant. This empirical case study addressed the conflict between people and leopards (Panthera panic's) in the Hyrcanian humid temperate forest (Iran). We analyzed our questionnaire and other data from all 34 villages around Golestan National Park in terms of probabilities of human-leopard conflicts over livestock predation, diseases of domestic animals and WorldClim bioclimatic variables. Using multiple predictive modeling approaches (generalized linear modeling GLM, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines MARS, Bayesian Belief Network BBN, BIOCLIM and DOMAIN), we show that climate continentality and precipitation patterns affect diseases, and more diseases lead to more conflicts. The Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) scenarios forecast aridization of the study area in 2041-2080 and a resultant decline of disease and conflict probabilities by 18.4-21.4% and 10.4-11.9%, respectively.

In the UK, peatlands cover 17.2% or similar to 1.58 Mha of the land surface and occur mainly in upland areas covering the headwaters of most major British rivers. However, large areas are now subject to prescribed vegetation burning despite policy guidance that recommends a strong presumption against burning on deep blanket peat. Wildfires occur sporadically but are forecast to increase in frequency in the future. This paper provides a synthesis of current knowledge about how UK peatland-dominated river catchments respond to fires caused by prescribed vegetation burning and uncontrolled wildfire. We provide insight into the effects of fire on the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biota of peatland river ecosystems, and the peatland-soil-driven controls on these effects at the catchment scale. Burning increases the depth to water table and water-table variability, although some small-scale studies indicate shallower water table in some places. More work is needed on fire effects on peatland river flow, but recent results suggest a complex response with smaller flow peaks for burned systems associated with most rainfall events, but enhanced peaks compared to unburned systems for the top quintile of rainfall events with the largest total rain. Evidence from biogeochemical studies suggests that fire leads to increased dissolved organic C concentrations in rivers. River biota responses primarily include significant reductions in the density of grazing mayflies but increases among detritivores including Chironomidae and Baetis mayflies. We provide a conceptual synthesis that links the main responses of terrestrial and aquatic systems to fire, and we summarize some major research gaps that should be prioritized to inform future policy around peatland management.",,,,,"Brown, Lee/0000-0002-2420-0088; Grayson, Richard/0000-0003-3637-3987",EMBER (Effects of Moorland Burning on the Ecohydrology of River basins) project (UK Natural Environment Research Council [NERC]) [NE/G00224X/1]; EMBER (Effects of Moorland Burning on the Ecohydrology of River basins) project (Yorkshire Water [YW]); YW; Moors for the Future grant [MRF0610]; NERC studentship quota award [NER/S/A/2006/14151]; North Pennines AONB Peatscapes project [ED1113347]; NERC open CASE studentship award [NE/F/013663/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G00224X/1],"This work was funded primarily via a grant to LEB, JH, and SMP as part of the EMBER (Effects of Moorland Burning on the Ecohydrology of River basins) project (UK Natural Environment Research Council [NERC] grant NE/G00224X/1, with additional support from Yorkshire Water [YW]).

The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 degrees C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.",,,,"Bjorkman, Anne/H-2211-2016","Bjorkman, Anne/0000-0003-2174-7800; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521","Natural Sciences and Engineering Resource Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program, ArcticNet; Government of Canada International Polar Year program; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of British Columbia; Arctic Institute of North America","We are grateful to many field assistants for their help in collecting phenology data over the 21years of this experiment.

The need to assess cumulative impacts is a major motivation for the current desire of managers and ecologists to define ecosystem ""health"" and ""stress"". A number of univariate metrics have been proposed to monitor health, including indicator species, indicator ratios and diversity or contaminant metrics. Alternatively, multivariate methods can be used to test for changes in community structure due to stress. In this study we developed multivariate models using statistical ordination techniques to identify key stressors affecting the 'health' of estuarine macrofaunal communities. Macrofaunal and associated environmental samples were collected across 75 sites from within Tauranga Harbour, a large estuary located on New Zealand's North Island. The harbour receives discharges from urbanised, industrial, agricultural and horticultural catchments. Distance-based linear modelling identified sediments, nutrients and heavy metals as key 'stressors' affecting the ecology of the harbour. Therefore, three multivariate models were developed based on the variability in community composition using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP). The multivariate models were found to be more sensitive to changing environmental health than simple univariate measures (abundance, species richness, evenness and Shannon-Wiener diversity) along an anthropogenic stress gradient. This multivariate approach can be used as a management or monitoring tool where sites are repeatedly sampled over time and tracked to determine whether the communities are moving towards a more healthy or unhealthy state. Ultimately, such statistical models provide a tool to forecast the distribution and abundance of species associated with habitat change and should enable long-term degradative change from multiple disturbances to be assessed.

Data from six sites in the Greater Caribbean were used to create statistically downscaled projections of water temperature using an ensemble of eleven global climate models and simulation RCP6.0 from the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Growth rates of five dinoflagellate species were estimated through the end of the 21st century using experimentally derived temperature vs. growth relationships for multiple strains of each species. The projected growth rates suggest the distribution and abundance of CFP-associated dinoflagellate species will shift substantially through 2099. Rising water temperatures are projected to increase the abundance and diversity of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa species in the Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. southeast Atlantic coast. In the Caribbean Sea, where the highest average temperatures correlate with the highest rates of CFP, it is projected that Gambierdiscus caribaeus, Gambierdiscus belizeanus and Fukuyoa ruetzleri will become increasingly dominant. Conversely, the lower temperature-adapted species Gambierdiscus carolinianus and Gambierdiscus ribotype 2 are likely to become less prevalent in the Caribbean Sea and are expected to expand their ranges in the northern Gulf of Mexico and farther into the western Atlantic. The risks associated with CFP are also expected to change regionally, with higher incidence rates in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. southeast Atlantic coast, with stable or slightly lower risks in the Caribbean Sea.

Physiological mechanisms may explain varying responses to disturbance between different tree species, but fewer studies have investigated conspecific variation in resilience to forest disturbance. We propose that a dynamic signal found in trees may provide clues to their post-disturbance fate. Specifically, linear versus nonlinear growth dynamics of a tree may be an indicator of its likelihood to survive a disturbance. Here, we investigate stands of red oak (Quercus rubra L.) that experienced disturbances in the form of drought and insect attack. Earlier work indicated that oaks dying during these disturbances had faster growth rates in their first years of life, but there was no obvious difference in canopy status, size, age, or microsite habitat between trees that survived and those that died. To investigate potential differences in growth dynamics between these trees, we quantified radial growth of individual trees and used two forecasting models to classify tree growth dynamics as linear or nonlinear. Trees were classified as healthy, declining, or dying based on crown cover, and dynamic patterns of growth were related to these health classifications. Contrary to expectations, we found healthy Q. rubra were significantly more likely to exhibit nonlinear growth dynamics relative to declining and dying trees. The drivers of this effect remain unclear, but nonlinear growth dynamics in healthy trees may represent an enhanced ability to benefit from resource pulses, in turn promoting greater resilience.

Consequently, anticipation of its presence is a matter of importance to prevent risks. The aim of this study is to build a cyanotoxin diagnostic model by using support vector machines (SVMs) in combination with the artificial bee colony (ABC) technique from cyanobacterial concentrations determined experimentally in the Trasona reservoir (Northern Spain), to forecast the cyanotoxins' presence in the Trasona reservoir (Northern Spain). The ABC-SVM model is aimed at highly nonlinear biological problems with sharp peaks and the tests carried out have proven its high performance. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical-chemical variables on the cyanotoxin content in the reservoir is presented through the model. Secondly, a predictive model of the cyanotoxin content is obtained. The agreement of the ABC-SVM-based model with experimental data confirmed its good performance.

Bison are infected with brucellosis (Brucella abortus) and their seasonal movements can expose livestock to infection. Yellowstone National Park has embarked on a program of adaptive management of bison, which requires a model that assimilates data to support management decisions. We constructed a Bayesian state-space model to reveal the influence of brucellosis on the Yellowstone bison population. A frequency-dependent model of brucellosis transmission was superior to a density-dependent model in predicting out-of-sample observations of horizontal transmission probability. A mixture model including both transmission mechanisms converged on frequency dependence. Conditional on the frequency-dependent model, brucellosis median transmission rate was 1.87 yr(-1). The median of the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive ratio (R-0) was 1.75. Seroprevalence of adult females varied around 60% over two decades, but only 9.6 of 100 adult females were infectious. Brucellosis depressed recruitment; estimated population growth rate averaged 1.07 for an infected population and 1.11 for a healthy population. We used five-year forecasting to evaluate the ability of different actions to meet management goals relative to no action. Annually removing 200 seropositive female bison increased by 30-fold the probability of reducing seroprevalence below 40% and increased by a factor of 120 the probability of achieving a 50% reduction in transmission probability relative to no action. Annually vaccinating 200 seronegative animals increased the likelihood of a 50% reduction in transmission probability by fivefold over no action. However, including uncertainty in the ability to implement management by representing stochastic variation in the number of accessible bison dramatically reduced the probability of achieving goals using interventions relative to no action. Because the width of the posterior predictive distributions of future population states expands rapidly with increases in the forecast horizon, managers must accept high levels of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the necessity of iterative, adaptive management with relatively short-term commitment to action and frequent reevaluation in response to new data and model forecasts. We believe our approach has broad applications.",,,,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016",,"National Park Service (Rocky Mountains Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit) [H120009004]; Yellowstone Park Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF 0914489, DBI-1052875]; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)","N.

First, we quantitatively capture the relationship between China's economic growth and energy consumption using the cointegration theory, and predict China's energy consumption by 2020 according to different economic growth targets. Second, we forecast China's energy structure in 2020 using compositional data and ARIMA models under different scenarios. Third, we deduce China's CO2 emission and carbon intensity in 2020. Furthermore, we investigate whether (or not) China can realize the carbon intensity target in premise of ensuring economic growth, and evaluate the contribution of the energy structure's adjustment to meeting this target.

Given these considerations, greater efforts are needed in two areas of research: improvements in early warning capability and advances in the management of ecosystems to enhance resilience. Current research has provided enhanced forecasting ability, scenario analysis, and detection of statistical anomalies that indicate abrupt change, but two key concerns remain: the detection of early warning signs near thresholds of change and the use of such warnings for ecosystem management. Furthermore, there may be no advance warning for some types of abrupt change, reinforcing the need to enhance resilience by managing ecosystems to reduce the possibility of crossing thresholds of change.

We suggest that focusing on species' niches, rather than traits, may provide the predictive power needed to forecast biodiversity change. We first examine two Neotropical frog congeners with drastically different affinities to deforestation and document how thermal niche explains deforestation tolerance. The more deforestation-tolerant species is associated with warmer macroclimates across Costa Rica, and warmer microclimates within landscapes. Further, in laboratory experiments, the more deforestation-tolerant species has critical thermal limits, and a jumping performance optimum, shifted similar to 2 degrees C warmer than those of the more forest-affiliated species, corresponding to the similar to 3 degrees C difference in daytime maximum temperature that these species experience between habitats. Crucially, neither species strictly specializes on either habitat - instead habitat use is governed by regional environmental temperature. Both species track temperature along an elevational gradient, and shift their habitat use from cooler forest at lower elevations to warmer deforested pastures upslope. To generalize these conclusions, we expand our analysis to the entire mid-elevational herpetological community of southern Costa Rica. We assess the climatological affinities of 33 amphibian and reptile species, showing that across both taxonomic classes, thermal niche predicts presence in deforested habitat as well as or better than many commonly used traits. These data suggest that warm-adapted species carry a significant survival advantage amidst the synergistic impacts of land- use conversion and climate change.",,,,"Frishkoff, Luke/H-8680-2019","Frishkoff, Luke/0000-0001-5738-2140",Ward Wilson Woods Jr. Environmental Studies Fund; Moore Family Foundation; Winslow Foundation; LuEsther Mertz Charitable Trust; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank DS Karp, CD Mendenhall, HK Frank, and A Ravenscraft for insightful comments and feedback.

Various approaches to modifying the water management of a catchment for restoration purposes exist and were performed in a preservation area in northwest Germany. To validate the effect of the re-wetting practice, a monitoring network of 46 wells was established and monthly readings were taken from 1997 onwards. A declining trend in water table depth was present at 39 wells and equaled on average a lowering of 20 cm during the study period from 1997 to 2012. So far, half of the trend lines are above 40 cm below ground, which is an indicator of an effective re-wetting practice, but they will decline below this threshold until 2032 according to linear regression analysis. The progress of water table depths might be accelerated by climate change. According to the meteorological forecast, air temperatures will rise and the annual precipitation pattern will change. Thus, the climatic water balance tends toward more negative values in the summer and positive values in the winter, favoring an earlier and more intense water table draw-down. Because root water extraction from shallow groundwater is limited to a certain depth, the forecast of water table depth development according to the recent trend depicts a worst-case scenario. Nevertheless, the results emphasize that restoration management should be validated and has to be adapted in certain ways when mitigating the impact of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, most restoration is conducted without clearly defined success measures or analysis of costs. Outcomes are influenced by environmental conditions that vary across space and time, yet such variation is rarely considered in restoration planning. Here, we present a cost-effectiveness analysis of terrestrial restoration methods to determine how practitioners may restore the highest native plant cover per dollar spent. We recorded costs of 120 distinct methods and described success in terms of native versus non-native plant germination, growth, cover, and density. We assessed effectiveness using a basic, commonly used metric (% native plant cover) and developed an index of cost-effectiveness (% native cover per dollar spent on restoration). We then evaluated success of multiple methods, given environmental variation across topography and multiple years, and found that the most successful method for restoring high native plant cover is often different from the method that results in the largest area restored per dollar expended, given fixed mitigation budgets. Based on our results, we developed decision-making trees to guide practitioners through established phases of restorationsite preparation, seeding and planting, and maintenance.

LocationThe pristine 300-km-long coast of French Guiana, South America. MethodsWe produced time series of mangrove maps using archival remote sensing images. We retrieved significant wave heights (H-S), mean wave periods (T-M) and mean wave directions ((M)) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis products. We used complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) decomposition to extract the main mode of mangrove surface area (M-S) variability and singular value decomposition (SVD) to test the relationships between M-S and H-S,T-M and (M). ResultsThe leading mode of variability extracted from the CEOF decomposition of M-S captured approximately 78% of the total auto-covariance and revealed multi-decadal fluctuations in M-S that were on the order of 10,000ha. The SVD results indicated that the multi-decadal fluctuation in M-S cross-covaried with H-S,T-M and (M) over the North Atlantic sector, particularly in the region immediately off the French Guiana coast that is remotely forced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the winter season. Main conclusionsWe provide evidence based on linear statistics that variations in the extent of mangroves are driven by large-scale, low-frequency changes in North Atlantic waves that are related to the NAO. Such a relationship is hypothesized to operate through wave pounding, which alters the mud substrates on which mangroves thrive and which varies with the phase of the NAO. In addition to long-term trends due to anthropogenic climate change, our results stress the importance of studying low-frequency modes of climate variability to understand changes in the extent of mangroves.",,,,"PROISY, Christophe/F-8501-2019; Martinez, Jean-Michel/AAK-4410-2020","PROISY, Christophe/0000-0002-6718-863X; Martinez, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-3281-8512; Walcker, Romain/0000-0002-5769-810X",French National Programme Ecosphere Continentale et Cotiere (EC2CO); CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-SENV-0002-01]; Belmont Forum project 'BF-Deltas: Catalyzing Action Towards Sustainability of Deltaic Systems with an Integrated Modeling Framework for Risk Assessment',"This work has benefited from the financial support of the French National Programme Ecosphere Continentale et Cotiere (EC2CO).

DON; ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; CALIFORNIA CURRENT; ECOSYSTEM; DISTRIBUTIONS; PATTERNS; SCALE; FOG; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,"Studies that model the effect of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems often use climate projections from downscaled global climate models (GCMs). These simulations are generally too coarse to capture patterns of fine-scale climate variation, such as the sharp coastal energy and moisture gradients associated with wind-driven upwelling of cold water. Coastal upwelling may limit future increases in coastal temperatures, compromising GCMs' ability to provide realistic scenarios of future climate in these coastal ecosystems. Taking advantage of naturally occurring variability in the high-resolution historic climatic record, we developed multiple fine-scale scenarios of California climate that maintain coherent relationships between regional climate and coastal upwelling. We compared these scenarios against coarse resolution GCM projections at a regional scale to evaluate their temporal equivalency. We used these historically based scenarios to estimate potential suitable habitat for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens D. Don) under 'normal' combinations of temperature and precipitation, and under anomalous combinations representative of potential future climates. We found that a scenario of warmer temperature with historically normal precipitation is equivalent to climate projected by GCMs for California by 2020-2030 and that under these conditions, climatically suitable habitat for coast redwood significantly contracts at the southern end of its current range. Our results suggest that historical climate data provide a high-resolution alternative to downscaled GCM outputs for near-term ecological forecasts. This method may be particularly useful in other regions where local climate is strongly influenced by ocean-atmosphere dynamics that are not represented by coarse-scale GCMs.",,,,"Kueppers, Lara M/M-8323-2013","Kueppers, Lara M/0000-0002-8134-3579; Fernandez, Miguel/0000-0002-8301-1340",Save the Redwoods League; Bobcat fellowship,"We thank A.

Since that time WNS has spread throughout the northeastern United States, southeastern Canada, and southwest across Pennsylvania and as far west as Missouri. Suspect WNS cases have been identified in Minnesota and Iowa, and the causative agent of WNS (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) has recently been detected in Mississippi. The impact of WNS is devastating for little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), causing up to 100% mortality in some overwintering populations, and previous research has forecast the extirpation of the species due to the disease. Recent evidence indicates that remnant populations may persist in areas where WNS is endemic. We developed a spatially explicit model of little brown bat population dynamics to investigate the potential for populations to recover under alternative scenarios. We used these models to investigate how starting population sizes, potential changes in the number of bats overwintering successfully in hibernacula, and potential changes in demographic rates of the population post WNS may influence the ability of the bats to recover to former levels of abundance. We found that populations of the little brown bat and other species that are highly susceptible to WNS are unlikely to return to pre-WNS levels in the near future under any of the scenarios we examined.

Reported declines of pollinator population sizes and diversity due to global changes may negatively affect the services they provide. Considering the importance of hoverflies as pollinators, we predict the climate change effect on the potential distribution range of selected species of the genus Merodon Meigen, 1803. We used two climate models (ECHAMS, HadCM3) and three climate change scenarios (optimistic, modest, pessimistic), under two time frames (2050 and 2080). We predicted the species spatial distribution as well as the species richness and the percentage turnover for two extreme dispersal hypotheses (limited, unlimited). The analysis was implemented using an ensemble forecasting modelling approach. Species adapted to higher altitudes (i.e. with lower temperature requirements) and/or latitudes were predicted to be more vulnerable to climate change vs. species able to tolerate a wider range of temperatures, by losing a higher percentage of climatically suitable area. Significant differences in distribution ranges were found between mountainous and the remaining species groups each one considered separately (viz. climate-generalists, Mediterranean, and east Mediterranean). Southern Balkans were predicted to experience a preservation of species assemblage across all climate change models, scenarios and dispersal assumptions, while the central and northwestern parts were predicted to be subject to an increased change of their species composition. We emphasize the importance of forecasting distribution shifts of a high number of species for the development of conservation strategies. Furthermore, due to the dependence of Merodon fly larvae on geophytes, we highlight the necessity of incorporating biotic interactions to model the potential distribution range shifts of these hoverfly species.

In temperate or mountain systems, biotic competitive interactions drive species distributions, and responses to climate change will ultimately depend upon productive and demographic processes such as growth, recruitment and mortality. We parameterized and used an individual-based, spatially explicit model of forest dynamics (SORTIE-ND) to investigate the role of species-specific differences in juvenile performance induced by climate change (juvenile growth and recruitment ability) in the dynamics of mixed forests located in the montane-subalpine ecotone of the Pyrenees. We assessed this role for two types of forests composed of three species with differing light requirements and sensitivity to climate change: (I) a mixed forest with two shade-intolerant pines (Pinus uncinata and Pints sylvestris) and (2) a mixed forest composed by a shade-intolerant pine and a shade-tolerant fir (Abies alba). Our results show that for species with similar light requirements (i.e., both pines), small differences in sapling growth response to climate change can lead to significant differences in future species composition (an increase in P. sylvestris growth of 10% leads to an increase in its abundance from 42% to 50.3%). Conversely, in pine-fir forests, shade-tolerance results more decisive than climate-induced changes in growth in driving the future forest composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For example, the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis posits that escape from herbivores by invasive plants results in the selection of more vigorous genotypes that reduce their allocation of resources to defense. In addition, understanding the defense strategy of an invasive plant may help forecast the likely impact of herbivory. We tested the prediction of reduced defense (i.e., resistance) in Genista monspessulana, measured indirectly as the performance of a specialist psyllid herbivore, by comparing five native and introduced plant populations. We also examined the ability of G. monspessulana to compensate for herbivory in the presence and the absence of psyllids for a single plant population from the native and introduced regions. Plant origin (native or introduced) did not influence the psyllid's abundance and population growth rate, suggesting no change in resistance to herbivory for introduced plants. Similarly, we found no overall difference in plant performance between individuals in the presence and the absence of psyllid herbivory, suggesting that G. monspessulana was able to fully compensate for herbivory. Damaged plants compensated by changing the pattern of branching, which also resulted in greater dry leaf biomass. We conclude that evolution of reduced defenses does not explain the success of G. monspessulana as an invader and that compensation for herbivory may limit the efficacy of the psyllid as a biological control agent.",,,,,"Mills, Nicholas/0000-0001-8885-8674","United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, a Bureau of Land Management Research Agreement; Georges Lurcy Fellowship (UC Berkeley)","The authors thank the staff from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and the USDA-ARS, European Biological Control Laboratory for assistance in collecting psyllids in France and locating European populations of G. monspessulana.

This process, induced by the warm eddy, results in abnormal surface sea temperature, downward shortwave/longwave radiation flux, surface latent heat flux, and wind changes. We used composite results and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to explore how the observed surface sea temperature anomalies influence precipitation in the South China Sea.

The Weather Research and Forecasting model simulated the variation of the atmospheric elements well, as observed by the Air-Sea Flux Tower in September 2013. The model was very accurate in simulating surface wind, radiation, and scalar-humidity. However, it failed to simulate the dramatic variations of surface air temperature, though it successfully reproduced the retreat of the summer monsoon, but weakened during the onset of the typhoon.

Current knowledge of these physiological processes in aquatic ectotherms is largely drawn from eurythermal or extreme stenothermal species. Yet many species of conservation concern exhibit tolerance windows and acclimation capacities in between these extremes. We linked transcriptome profiles to organismal tolerance in a mesothermal endangered fish, the delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), to quantify the cellular processes, sublethal thresholds and effects of thermal acclimation on acute stress responses. Delta smelt initiated rapid molecular changes in line with expectations of theoretical thermal limitation models, but also exhibited diminished capacity to modify the expression of some genes and cellular mechanisms key to coping with acute thermal stress found in eurytherms. Sublethal critical thresholds occurred 4-6 degrees C below their upper tolerance limits, and thermal acclimation shifted the onset of acute thermal stress and tolerance as predicted. However, we found evidence that delta smelt's limited thermal plasticity may be partially due to an inability of individuals to effectively make physiological adjustments to truly achieve new homoeostasis under heightened temperatures, resulting in chronic thermal stress. These findings provide insight into the physiological basis of the diverse patterns of thermal tolerances observed in nature. Moreover, understanding how underlying molecular mechanisms shape thermal acclimation capacity, acute stress responses and ultimately differential phenotypes contributes to a predictive framework to deduce species' responses insitu to changes in selective pressures due to climate change.",,,,,,"University of California Agricultural Experiment StationUniversity of California System [2098-H]; United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation [R12AP20018]; State and Federal Contractors Water Agency [201301957]; California Delta Stewardship Council [201015533]; National Science Foundation Graduate-12 Fellowship Program under DGE [0841297]; California Sea Grant Delta Science Doctoral Fellowship; California Sea Grant Delta Science Post-Doctoral Fellowship","We thank FCCL staff, in particular J.

The demand for eradication projects is increasing and practitioners are planning projects on increasingly larger, more remote and more technically challenging islands. Undertaking strategic planning for conservation requires information on both the cost and benefit of proposed actions, to determine the trade-off in selecting one project over another. To date the cost of eradication projects is disparately reported in the literature, an artefact of different reporting requirements based on where the eradication was undertaken, the scale of the project, the implementing agency and its accountabilities, and inconsistency in reporting all project component costs. Eradication projects have characteristics that allow more refined cost forecasting relative to other conservation initiatives, including a narrow set of major eradication techniques being used, a defined beginning and end point, and distinct project components. Here we present the major cost centres for eradication projects, including a dataset for a suite of rodent, ungulate and predator eradications, using a dataset of 46 eradications primarily from New Zealand, Ecuador and the USA. We found cost increased with island size for all eradication types except ground based rodent eradications.

However, many reintroduction efforts fail, and the lack of rigorous monitoring programmes and statistical models have prevented a general understanding of the factors affecting metapopulation viability following reintroduction. Spatially explicit metapopulation theory provides the basis for understanding the dynamics of fragmented populations linked by dispersal, but the theory has rarely been used to guide reintroduction programmes because most spatial metapopulation models require presence-absence data from every site in the network, and they do not allow for observation error such as imperfect detection. We develop a spatial occupancy model that relaxes these restrictive assumptions and allows for inference about metapopulation extinction risk and connectivity. We demonstrate the utility of the model using sixyears of data on the Chiricahua leopard frog Lithobates chiricahuensis, a threatened desert-breeding amphibian that was reintroduced to a network of sites in Arizona USA in 2003. Our results indicate that the model can generate precise predictions of extinction risk and produce connectivity maps that can guide conservation efforts following reintroduction. In the case of L. chiricahuensis, many sites were functionally isolated, and 82% of sites were characterized by intermittent water availability and high local extinction probabilities (084, 95% CI: 064-099). However, under the current hydrological conditions and spatial arrangement of sites, the risk of metapopulation extinction is estimated to be <3% over a 50-year time horizon. Low metapopulation extinction risk appears to result from the high dispersal capability of the species, the high density of sites in the region and the existence of predator-free permanent wetlands with low local extinction probabilities. Should management be required, extinction risk can be reduced by either increasing the hydroperiod of existing sites or by creating new sites to increase connectivity.Synthesis and applications. This work demonstrates how spatio-temporal statistical models based on ecological theory can be applied to forecast the outcomes of conservation actions such as reintroduction.

Here we review recent advances in this area in the context of macrophysiological forecasts of the impacts of warming. Some studies have suggested that risk estimates may be inaccurate owing to microclimate variation or behavioural responses. Using modelled microclimatic data we illustrate this problem, demonstrating that soil microclimates on the Australian continent will warm in concert with global climate change such that the upper thermal tolerance limits of many insects will be exceeded across much of the continent. Deeper microclimates will be cooler and more hospitable, emphasising the importance of behavioural adaptation and movement amongst microclimates as a response to environmental warming.",,,,"; Chown, Steven/H-3347-2011","Duffy, Grant/0000-0002-9031-8164; Janion-Scheepers, Charlene/0000-0001-5942-7912; Chown, Steven/0000-0001-6069-5105","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140102815, DP140101240]",This work was supported by funding from the Australian Research Council through Discovery Projects DP140102815 and DP140101240 awarded to SLC.,,,13,13,4,38,,,,2214-5745,2214-5753,,CURR OPIN INSECT SCI,Curr.

Yet, the extent to which global environmental changes contribute to changes in local diversity is poorly understood. We investigated biodiversity changes in a meta-analysis of 39 resurvey studies in European temperate forests (3988 vegetation records in total, 17-75years between the two surveys) by assessing the importance of (i) coarse-resolution (i.e., among sites) vs. fine-resolution (i.e., within sites) environmental differences and (ii) changing environmental conditions between surveys. Our results clarify the mechanisms underlying the direction and magnitude of local-scale biodiversity changes. While not detecting any net local diversity loss, we observed considerable among-site variation, partly explained by temporal changes in light availability (a local driver) and density of large herbivores (a regional driver). Furthermore, strong evidence was found that presurvey levels of nitrogen deposition determined subsequent diversity changes.

It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used. Synthesis and applications.

As meteorological information is key to improving productivity for pastoralists, it represents a challenge at both local and national level to develop an efficient information dissemination system. However, few studies have focused specifically on pastoralists as end-users, and the best mode of delivering meteorological information to pastoralists remains unknown. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Burkina Faso using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper examines 1) the principal modes used by pastoralists to receive information, and 2) in what form and by which type of media pastoralists actually prefer to receive information. It was found that mobile phones have replaced traditional forecasting methods as these were becoming unreliable with increased climate variability. The phone was used to acquire updated informal information on, for example, the arrival of the rain from friends and family staying in other areas. The findings illuminate how mobile phones have a huge potential to deliver more formal information to pastoralists, and we propose that forecasts should be available as voice messages in local languages rather than text messages.

In this study, we examined the effects of environmental factors and human developmental features associated with disturbances on probability of occurrence of juveniles of invasive Triadica sebifera and three native plant species, Baccharis halimifolia, Ilex vomitoria and Morella cerifera within a typical coastal transition in coastal Mississippi, USA. Methods We recorded presence of juveniles of focal species and measured environmental factors (soil salinity, canopy openness, soil texture and soil carbon to nitrogen ratio) along an 11.3 km transect located at Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. Further, we documented anthropogenic features and associated activities as a proxy for human disturbance. Important Findings With the exception of I. vomitoria, all other species occurrences were significantly influenced by an interaction between soil salinity and canopy openness. The occurrence of I. vomitoria sharply decreased with salinity. B. halimifolia occurrence peaked at moderate levels of salinity and low to moderate levels of canopy openness. Occurrences of M. cerifera and the invasive T. sebifera were highest at low levels of salinity and canopy openness. These results indicate that salinity is a strong driver that limits distribution of juvenile native and invasive species in coastal transitions. Logistic regression confirmed the positive effects of anthropogenic disturbances on T. sebifera and I. vomitoria occurrence. It appears that while soil salinity is likely to drive retreat of the seaward boundaries of woody plant species distributions, increased human developments along the coast likely enhance the inland spread of species, in particular the invasive T. sebifera by increasing disturbances and facilitating dispersal. Results from this study can offer insight for the development of T. sebifera management and preventive measures for further spread along coastal areas of the southeastern USA.",,,,"Paudel, Shishir/H-6813-2019","Paudel, Shishir/0000-0002-0794-5096",,,,,8,8,1,51,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Among the many methods used in the field, one or two are in practice assumed to be best' and are used commonly, often without explicit testing. We explore herein implications of the no free lunch' theorem, which suggests that no single optimization approach will prove to be best under all circumstances: we developed diverse virtual species with known niche and dispersal properties to test a suite of niche modelling algorithms designed to estimate potential areas of distribution. The result was that (i) indeed, no single best' algorithm was found and (ii) different algorithms performing very different manners depending on the particularities of the virtual species. The conclusion is that niche or distribution modelling studies should begin by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the particular circumstances of the study and choose an algorithm for a particular challenge based on the results of those tests.

However, information to forecast population-level consequences of such changes is often lacking. We developed an interim framework to assess the population consequences of disturbance when empirical information is sparse. We show how daily effects of disturbance, which are often straightforward to estimate, can be scaled to the disturbance duration and to multiple sources of disturbance. We used expert elicitation to estimate parameters that define how changes in individual behaviour or physiology affect vital rates and incorporated them into a stochastic population model. Model outputs can be used to evaluate cumulative impacts of disturbance over space and time. As an example, we forecast the potential effects of disturbance from offshore wind farm construction on the North Sea harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population.Synthesis and applications. The interim framework can be used to forecast the effects of disturbances from human activities on animal populations, to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures and to identify priority areas for research that reduces uncertainty in population forecasts.

Modelling rare and threatened species is particularly important for conservation purposes. However, modelling rare species is difficult because the combination of few occurrences and many predictor variables easily leads to model overfitting. A new strategy using ensembles of small models was recently developed in an attempt to overcome this limitation of rare species modelling and has been tested successfully for only a single species so far. Here, we aim to test the approach more comprehensively on a large number of species including a transferability assessment. For each species, numerous small (here bivariate) models were calibrated, evaluated and averaged to an ensemble weighted by AUC scores. These ensembles of small models' (ESMs) were compared to standard SDMs using three commonly used modelling techniques (GLM, GBM and Maxent) and their ensemble prediction. We tested 107 rare and under-sampled plant species of conservation concern in Switzerland. We show that ESMs performed significantly better than standard SDMs. The rarer the species, the more pronounced the effects were. ESMs were also superior to standard SDMs and their ensemble when they were evaluated using a transferability assessment.

In the context of recent advances in species distribution modelling, however, both the environment and the ecological niche of a species have often been treated and quantified as static entities. Here, our aim was to explore how species' realized niches and geographical ranges are dynamically shaped by the decoupled spatio-temporal availability of different environmental conditions, using the migration of Sylvia warblers as an example. LocationPalaearctic, Afrotropical and Indo-Malay ecozones. MethodsWe used a species distribution modelling approach to evaluate the niche characteristics of Sylvia warblers under their actual migration strategies as well as null models assuming resident behaviour. We focused on climate and land cover as niche dimensions, taking into account the spatial availability of environmental conditions during the peak breeding and non-breeding season for each Sylvia species. ResultsMigration did not increase the overlap between breeding and non-breeding niches compared with breeding and non-breeding niche overlap in resident null models. Sylvia warblers did not compensate for the costs of a longer migratory journey by tracking their climatic niche or land-cover niche more closely. Instead, Sylvia warblers migrated further than the closest available area with suitable climate and land cover. Main conclusionsClimatic niche tracking is unlikely to be the main driver of migration in Sylvia warblers. We suggest that taking dynamic environments into account and comparing actual niche characteristics to those resulting from alternative possible range dynamics enhances our understanding of the drivers behind organisms' movements and distributions.",,,,"Graham, Catherine/A-9560-2011; Graham, Catherine/AAN-1237-2020; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019","Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948; Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586","Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; LOEWE excellence initiative by the Hessen State Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts","I.L. was supported by a doctoral scholarship from the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; I.L. and K.B.-G. acknowledge support from the LOEWE excellence initiative by the Hessen State Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts.

However, several studies suggest the importance of non-climatic physical stressors, such as irradiance, which may interact synergistically with temperature as unexpected de leterious effects or, alternatively, as additive factors. We performed 1 field and 1 mesocosm experiment to evaluate the potential interactive effects of physical stressors operating at the southern distributional ranges of Fucus serratus and F. spiralis, 2 intertidal macroalgae with contrasting geographic distributions. The first experiment analysed field response to low tide stress by measuring temperature increase, desiccation rate and photoinhibition in fronds exposed to air and fronds covered by other fronds. The second experiment compared the response of these 2 fucoid species by recreating harsh vs. mild conditions of major intertidal stressors. Results suggest that the additive effects of climatic factors, namely air temperature, and non-climatic physical variables, namely irradiance and air humidity, partially explain and can help to forecast distributional shifts of intertidal macroalgae. F. spiralis was better adapted than its congener F. serratus with lower inhibition and faster recovery. This agrees with its low latitude affinity and higher position in the intertidal. The only major interactive effect observed was the antagonistic amelioration of atmospheric thermal stress by mid to high humidity conditions, particularly when irradiance was not excessive. These intertidal seaweeds retain ambient humidity and shade themselves, lowering physiological damage through self-cover with their fronds. We observed overall additive effects of stressors and higher physiological resilience of covered algae to low tide stressors than expected by their additive effects.",,,,"Martinez, Brezo/K-6726-2014; Martinez, Brezo/AAE-9825-2019; Arenas, Francisco/M-7095-2015","Martinez, Brezo/0000-0002-7501-7726; Martinez, Brezo/0000-0002-7501-7726; Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) of PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/MAR/105147/2008]; FEDER through the programme COMPETE-QREN; Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2010-19301]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the COMPETE Operational Competitiveness ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU); FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2013],"We thank L.

Properly assessing the uncertainty in such predictions is non-trivial and requires validation with independent datasets. Notably, model complexity (number of model parameters) remains a major concern in relation to overfitting and, hence, transferability of Maxent models. An emerging approach is to validate the cross-temporal transferability of model predictions using paleoecological data. In this study, we assess the effect of model complexity on the performance of Maxent projections across time using two European plant species (Alnus giutinosa (L.) Gaertn. and Corylus avellana L) with an extensive late Quaternary fossil record in Spain as a study case. We fit 110 models with different levels of complexity under present time and tested model performance using AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AlCc (corrected Akaike Information Criterion) through the standard procedure of randomly partitioning current occurrence data. We then compared these results to an independent validation by projecting the models to mid-Holocene (6000 years before present) climatic conditions in Spain to assess their ability to predict fossil pollen presence-absence and abundance. We find that calibrating Maxent models with default settings result in the generation of overly complex models. While model performance increased with model complexity when predicting current distributions, it was higher with intermediate complexity when predicting mid-Holocene distributions. Hence, models of intermediate complexity resulted in the best trade-off to predict species distributions across time. Reliable temporal model transferability is especially relevant for forecasting species distributions under future climate change. Consequently, species-specific model tuning should be used to find the best modeling settings to control for complexity, notably with paleoecological data to independently validate model projections. For cross-temporal projections of species distributions for which paleoecological data is not available, models of intermediate complexity should be selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To understand what such rapid land use changes have meant for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, we used data from two forest sites in the western Pyrenees, combined with regional data on pastures and crop production (potato, cereal), to calibrate the ecosystem-level model FORECAST. Then, we simulated 150 years of land use for each site, emulating historical changes. Our estimates show that the conversion from forests into pastures and crops created C and N deficits (378-427 Mg C ha(-1), 4.0-4.6 Mg N ha(-1)) from which these sites are still recovering. The main ecological process behind the creation of these deficits was the loss of the ecological legacy of soil organic matter (SUM) created by the forest, particularly during conversion to farming. Pastures were able to reverse, stop or at least slow down the loss of such legacy. In conclusion, our work shows the deep impact of historical land use in ecosystem attributes, both in magnitude of removed C and N stocks and in duration of such impact. Also, the usefulness of ecological modeling in absence of historical data to estimate such changes is showcased, providing a framework for potential C and N stocks to be reached by climate change mitigation measures such as forest restoration.

Feeding a growing world population while reducing the impact on the environment requires immediate and effective solutions. Sustainability is difficult to define because it embodies multifaceted concepts and the combination of variables that make a production system sustainable can be unique to each production situation. Sustainability represents the state of a complex system that is always evolving. It is an intrinsic characteristic of the system that needs to be shaped and managed. A sustainable system has the ability to coexist with other systems at a different output level after a period of perturbation. Resilience is the ability of a system to recover and reestablish a dynamic equilibrium after it has been perturbed. Sustainable intensification (SI) produces more output(s) through the more efficient use of resources while reducing negative impact on the environment; it provides opportunities for increasing animal and crop production per area while employing sustainable production alternatives that fully consider the three pillars of sustainability (planet, people, and profit). Identifying the most efficient animals and feeding systems is the prerequisite to successful applications of sustainable livestock intensification programs. Animal scientists must develop strategies that forecast the rate and magnitude of global changes as well as their possible influences on the food production chain.

We describe common pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models to help novice users and end users better interpret these models. Four primary caveats corresponding to different phases of the modeling process, each with supporting documentation and examples, include: (1) all sampling data are incomplete and potentially biased; (2) predictor variables must capture distribution constraints; (3) no single model works best for all species, in all areas, at all spatial scales, and over time; and (4) the results of species distribution models should be treated like a hypothesis to be tested and validated with additional sampling and modeling in an iterative process.

We examined the effects of 5 years of in situ air and soil warming on net primary productivity (NPP), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and C:N in dominant Alaskan tundra mosses. Air warming increased mean air temperatures by up to 0.5A degrees C and resulted in an 80-90% reduction in NPP in the feather moss Pleurozium and the peat moss Sphagnum. Soil warming increased permafrost thaw depth by 12-18%, upper soil water content by 23-27%, and resulted in a threefold increase in Sphagnum NPP. delta C-13 was positively correlated with moss NPP, and increased by 0.5-1aEuro degrees in all mosses under soil warming. C:N was reduced in Sphagnum and Pleurozium, due to increases in tissue %N in the soil warming treatment, suggesting that moss N availability could increase as temperatures increases. Higher N availability in warmer conditions, however, may be offset by unfavorable moisture conditions for moss growth. Similar to responses in tundra vascular plant communities, our results forecast interspecific differences in productivity among tundra mosses. Specifically, air warming may reduce productivity in Sphagnum and Pleurozium, but soil warming could offset this response in Sphagnum. Such responses may lead to changes in tundra moss community structure and function as temperatures increase that have the potential to alter tundra C and N cycling in a future climate.",,,,,"Salmon, Verity G./0000-0002-2188-551X",,,,,12,13,5,89,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,SEP,2015,18,6,,,,,1070,1082,,10.1007/s10021-015-9884-7,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000360543100011,,,,,

Hence, understanding a species ecological niche and guild membership would serve as a valuable management tool for providing a priori assessments of a species extinction risk. It also would help to forecast a species capacity to respond to land use change, as what might be expected to occur under financial incentive schemes to improve threatened ecological vegetation communities. However, basic natural history information is lacking for many terrestrial species, particularly reptiles in temperate regions of the world. To overcome this limitation, we collated 3527 reptile observations from 52 species across an endangered woodland ecoregion in south-eastern Australia and examined ecological niche breadth and microhabitat guild structure. We found 30% of species had low ecological niche values and were classified as habitat specialists associated with large eucalypt trees, woody debris, surface rock or rocky outcrops. Cluster analysis separated species into six broad guilds based on microhabitat similarity. Approximately 80% of species belonged to guilds associated with old growth vegetation attributes or non-renewable litho-resources such as surface rock or rocky outcrops. Our results suggest that agri-environment schemes that focus purely on grazing management are unlikely to provide immediate benefits to broad suites of reptiles associated with old growth vegetation and litho-resources.

We used species distribution models (SDMs) to assess factors, including the role of anthropogenic perturbation, that mediate its invasion on a regional scale. A better understanding of the important large-scale factors may help us identify future areas of concern and potential avenues for control. We built SDMs from presence records and randomly selected pseudo-absences of mosquitofish on a 10- x 10-km grid. We used 10 modeling techniques implemented in the biomod2 software and ensemble forecasts. Final models contained 12 environmental predictors, including natural environmental factors (elevation, slope, topographic index, precipitation, accumulated flow, temperature mean and range) and anthropogenic perturbation indicators (population density, urban and agricultural land uses, number of local and upstream dams). Elevation, temperature, and accumulated flow most strongly influenced mosquitofish distribution, and mosquitofish were found more frequently in downstream, warmer waters. Anthropogenic features, except the number of upstream dams, were poorer predictors of mosquitofish presence than were natural environmental factors. The best models suggested that mosquitofish are more likely to occur in areas with more dams upstream, but removing this predictor did not strongly affect model results.

These data can be used to delineate two or more genetic clusters within the species range, and to identify admixtures of individuals within genetic clusters that reflect different patterns of ancestry.

However, most spatial models of species richness do not explicitly consider inter-specific interactions. Here, we test whether incorporating biotic interactions into high-resolution models alters predictions of species richness as hypothesised. We included key biotic variables (cover of three dominant arctic-alpine plant species) into two methodologically divergent species richness modelling frameworks - stacked species distribution models (SSDM) and macroecological models (MEM) - for three ecologically and evolutionary distinct taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens). Predictions from models including biotic interactions were compared to the predictions of models based on climatic and abiotic data only. Including plant-plant interactions consistently and significantly lowered bias in species richness predictions and increased predictive power for independent evaluation data when compared to the conventional climatic and abiotic data based models. Improvements in predictions were constant irrespective of the modelling framework or taxonomic group used. The global biodiversity crisis necessitates accurate predictions of how changes in biotic and abiotic conditions will potentially affect species richness patterns. Here, we demonstrate that models of the spatial distribution of species richness can be improved by incorporating biotic interactions, and thus that these key predictor factors must be accounted for in biodiversity forecasts.",,,,"Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011","Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Mod, Heidi/0000-0001-7800-2688",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [1140873]; Research Foundation of the Univ. of Helsinki,"We acknowledge funding from the Academy of Finland (Project Number 1140873).

The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of algal abnormal proliferation using as a predictor the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of previous days. For this purpose, some biological parameters (phytoplankton species expressed in biovolume) in addition to the most important chemical and physical-chemical parameters were considered. The implementation of the statistical learning method known as support vector machines (SVMs) allowed us to predict the Chl a concentration, one of the most frequently used estimators of algal biomass, and to study its evolution in the Trasona reservoir (Principality of Asturias, Northern Spain). In the first place, the main goal was to obtain the dependence relationship of chlorophyll concentration as a function of not only several chemical and physical-chemical variables but also the biological ones. This dependence relationship was useful in setting the significance order of the variables involved in the Chl a prediction. Secondly, a model for forecasting the algal abnormal proliferation is obtained. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter.

Long-term observations indicate that plant species with high stoichiometric homeostasis for nitrogen (H-N), i.e., the ability to decouple foliar N levels from variation in soil N availability, were more common and stable through time than low-H-N species in a central U.S. grassland. However, with nine years of nitrogen addition, species with high H-N decreased in abundance, while those with low H-N increased in abundance. In contrast, in climate change experiments simulating a range of forecast hydrologic changes, e.g., extreme drought (two years), increased rainfall variability (14 years), and chronic increases in rainfall (21 years), plant species with the highest H-N were least responsive to changes in soil water availability.

Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 degrees C and 30 degrees C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17 degrees of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8 degrees C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.",,,,,"Shurin, Jonathan/0000-0001-7870-1972",University of California-San DiegoUniversity of California System,"We thank Chris Neufeld and Akana Noto for their help with copepod sampling.

Here, we examine how stable are the realized niches of distinct populations of the endangered green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) which are defined on the basis of genetic and demographic data and are distributed around the globe. We used 906 georeferenced records of green turtle nesting sites that are embedded within eight Regional Management Units to compare climatic niche for each one of the distinct units. We used an asymmetric overall index and a decision-tree model to assess niche conservatism through a comparison of temperature- and precipitation-based bioclimatic variables that characterize the climatic niche breadth of the spatially distinct population segments. We found a high degree of variance in climatic space, which also lacks any latitudinal pattern. Environmental determinants vary significantly across the studied population units: variables that have been long-recognized as critical for nesting (e.g., maximum temperature of the warmest month) showed only low overlap between some of different regional entities. Our results contribute substantially to the current debate on the predictive power of species distribution models that use only climate variables as predictors when aggregating data from various populations.

There is currently no simple method available to estimate vegetation cover at the broad scale (above the level of individual vegetation-type mapping or modelling) that does not rely, at least in part, on remote sensing data. This means that for periods where this data is unavailable (pre 1980 and future forecasting) estimates of vegetation cover are also unavailable. De Martonne's simple Aridity Index (AI) requires only rainfall and temperature data however it is not widely applicable and regularly fails in arid and semi-arid regions. The Climate Aridity Vegetation Index (CAVI) has been developed in an attempt to overcome this limitation while retaining simplicity in the data required and in the calculation. The CAVI is based on readily available rainfall and temperature data and has been applied and tested across 12 years of monthly data across Australia. The CAVI estimates have then been validated by comparing them to the corresponding fractional cover satellite data. Performance is discussed in the context of using vegetation cover estimates in wind erosion research. The results were particularly encouraging in arid to semi-arid regions and can potentially be used as a surrogate for historical broad scale vegetation cover and possibly future projections.

A wide range of factors affect otolith morphology and a fundamental challenge in morphometric stock identification is to develop a consensus on the biological interpretation of otolith shape variation. To date, there are few comprehensive reports that have examined various factors simultaneously at multiple scales in natural conditions. In this study, I identified sources of otolith shape variation across spatial and taxonomic scales using a new hierarchical partitioning method embedded in a geometric morphometric framework. Various environmental, taxonomic and endogenic factors which affect otolith shape were quantitatively investigated in 2077 coral reef fishes. Using the new partitioning method, allometry accounted for a considerable degree of otolith shape variation at all scales and contributed more variation to regional differences than did habitats or islands. While large-scale variations are expected to be associated with significant shape variation, the study provides quantitative evidence that both local environmental variables and large-scale patterns contribute equally to total otolith shape variation. Models that aim at discriminating stocks and forecasting stock boundaries implicitly assume that the within-stock morphological variation is negligible in regard to the variation that exists among stocks. The importance of local environmental variables may therefore act as an important confounding effect into those predictive models. More generally, the degree of contribution of some variables differed substantially among the taxonomic scales, as did their relationship among spatial scales. A scale-dependent understanding of factors affecting otolith morphology is critical in understanding the integrity of fish populations and is an effective tool in management of fisheries resources.",,,,"Vignon, Matthias/N-1122-2019","Vignon, Matthias/0000-0001-9222-8966",USR 3278 EPHE-CNRS CRIOBE,This study was partly supported by USR 3278 EPHE-CNRS CRIOBE.

For example, geographical ranges and extinction risks have been inferred from thermal constraints on activity during the adult stage. Yet, most animals pass through a sessile embryonic stage before reaching adulthood, making them more susceptible to warming climates than current models would suggest. By projecting microclimates at high spatio-temporal resolution and measuring thermal tolerances of embryos, we developed a life cycle model of population dynamics for North American lizards. Our analyses show that previous models dramatically underestimate the demographic impacts of climate change. A predicted loss of fitness in 2% of the USA by 2100 became 35% when considering embryonic performance in response to hourly fluctuations in soil temperature. Most lethal events would have been overlooked if we had ignored thermal stress during embryonic development or had averaged temperatures over time.

We analyzed SDM performance and partitioned variance among prediction maps for 15 rare vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using all possible combinations of seven potential sources of uncertainty in SDMs: algorithms, climate datasets, model domain, species presences, variable collinearity, CO2 emissions scenarios, and general circulation models. The choice of modeling algorithm was the greatest source of uncertainty in SDM performance and prediction maps, with some additional variation in performance associated with the comprehensiveness of the species presences used for modeling. Other sources of uncertainty that have received attention in the SDM literature such as variable collinearity and model domain contributed little to differences in SDM performance or predictions in this study. Predictions from different algorithms tended to be more variable at northern range margins for species with more northern distributions, which may complicate conservation planning at the leading edge of species' geographic ranges. The clear message emerging from this work is that researchers should use multiple algorithms for modeling rather than relying on predictions from a single algorithm, invest resources in compiling a comprehensive set of species presences, and explicitly evaluate uncertainty in SDM predictions at leading range margins.

After determination of homogeneous units, vegetation sampling was carried out using random systematic method. Depending on the plant species, the plot size was determined using Minimal Area method from 2 to 25 m(2). Sample size was also determined to be 60 plots with respect to vegetation cover variations using statistical method. In order to sample the soil at each habitat, eight holes was drilled and samples were taken from 0 to 30 and 30 to 80 cm depths. Plant distribution modeling was conducted using LR, the MaxEnt and ANN. After implementation of the model, to evaluate and predict the actual maps conformity, Kappa coefficient and true skill statistic (TSS) were measured. On the basis of Kappa and TSS values calculated, prediction accuracy of the methods used varies for different habitats. Results indicate that LR model is capable to predict habitats distribution of Halocnemum strobilaceum, which has limited ecological niche at very good level (kappa = 0.71). The model obtained from the MaxEnt could predict habitat distribution of Artemisia sieberi at very good level. However, the prediction maps derived from ANN models for all studied habitats were obtained to be at good and very good level. Results indicate a strong relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions being modeled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was superior in all circumstances. Based on these results it can be said that in order to choose the optimal approach of habitats distribution modeling in addition to the statistical considerations, purpose and expected accuracy, data available types, ecological niche range of species and be interpreted of method in terms of ecological concepts also should be considered.

From 2010-2013 we radio-tracked 53 ratsnakes in the fragmented region of central Missouri. We relocated each snake 4x per week and used movement frequency as an index of activity. We used generalized linear mixed models within an information-theoretic approach to evaluate temporal and weather variables as potential predictors of snake activity. While snakes were generally sedentary, activity showed a linear response to relative humidity and a quadratic response to air temperature, peaking near 30 A degrees C. Seasonal activity patterns differed between sexes and among years, but snakes were generally least active in mid-summer, regardless of weather. Our findings provide strong evidence that air temperature and relative humidity differentially affect activity patterns of an important predator and are the mechanism explaining increased nest predation rates with warmer temperatures.",,,,,,U.S.D.A.

We forecasted the distribution of extant European large mammals (17 carnivores and 10 ungulates) based on 2 Rio+20 scenarios of socioeconomic development: business as usual and reduced impact through changes in human consumption of natural resources. These scenarios are linked to scenarios of land-use change and climate change through the spatial allocation of land conversion up to 2050. We used a hierarchical framework to forecast the extent and distribution of mammal habitat based on species' habitat preferences (as described in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List database) within a suitable climatic space fitted to the species' current geographic range. We analyzed the geographic and taxonomic variation of habitat loss for large mammals and the potential effect of the reduced impact policy on loss mitigation. Averaging across scenarios, European large mammals were predicted to lose 10% of their habitat by 2050 (25% in the worst-case scenario). Predicted loss was much higher for species in northwestern Europe, where habitat is expected to be lost due to climate and land-use change. Change in human consumption patterns was predicted to substantially improve the conservation of habitat for European large mammals, but not enough to reduce extinction risk if species cannot adapt locally to climate change or disperse. Escenarios de Perdida de Mamiferos Mayores en Europa para el Siglo XXI Las distribuciones y poblaciones de los mamiferos grandes estan declinando a nivel global, lo que conlleva un aumento en el riesgo de su extincion. Pronosticamos la distribucion de los mamiferos europeos existentes (17 carnivoros y 10 ungulados) con base en dos escenarios Rio+20 de desarrollo socio-economico: la normalidad y el impacto reducido a traves de los cambios en el consumo humano de los recursos naturales. Estos escenarios estan conectados a escenarios de cambio en el uso de suelo y cambio climatico por medio de la asignacion espacial de la conversion de suelo hasta el ano 2050. Usamos un marco de trabajo jerarquico para pronosticar la extension y la distribucion de los habitats de los mamiferos con base en las preferencias de habitat de las especies (como se describe en la base de datos de la Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de especies) dentro de un espacio climatico adecuado para acomodar a las especies en su extension geografica actual. Analizamos la variacion geografica y taxonomica de la perdida de habitat para los mamiferos mayores y el efecto potencial de la politica de impacto reducido sobre la mitigacion de perdidas. En los escenarios en promedio, se predijo que los mamiferos mayores de Europa perderian el 10% de su habitat para 2050 (25% el peor de los casos). La perdida pronosticada fue mucho mas alta para las especies en el noroeste de Europa, en donde se espera perder habitats debido al cambio climatico y de uso de suelo. Se pronostico que los cambios en los patrones de consumo humano mejorarian considerablemente la conservacion del habitat de los grandes mamiferos de Europa, pero no lo suficiente para reducir el riesgo de extincion si las especies no se pueden adaptar localmente al cambio climatico o a la dispersion.

While the impacts of climate change on individual species have been well-documented, there is a paucity of studies on climate-mediated changes in community dynamics. Our objectives were to investigate the relationship between temporal turnover in avian biodiversity and changes in climatic conditions and to assess the role of landscape fragmentation in affecting this relationship. We hypothesized that community turnover would be highest in regions experiencing the most pronounced changes in climate and that these patterns would be reduced in human-dominated landscapes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified temporal turnover in avian communities over a 20-year period using data from the New York State Breeding Atlases collected during 1980-1985 and 2000-2005. We applied Bayesian spatially varying intercept models to evaluate the relationship between temporal turnover and temporal trends in climatic conditions and landscape fragmentation. We found that models including interaction terms between climate change and landscape fragmentation were superior to models without the interaction terms, suggesting that the relationship between avian community turnover and changes in climatic conditions was affected by the level of landscape fragmentation. Specifically, we found weaker associations between temporal turnover and climatic change in regions with prevalent habitat fragmentation. We suggest that avian communities in fragmented landscapes are more robust to climate change than communities found in contiguous habitats because they are comprised of species with wider thermal niches and thus are less susceptible to shifts in climatic variability. We conclude that highly fragmented regions are likely to undergo less pronounced changes in composition and structure of faunal communities as a result of climate change, whereas those changes are likely to be greater in contiguous and unfragmented habitats.",,,,,,"NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNXO9AK16G]; Boone and Crockett Club; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1106609, EF-1137309, EF-1241868, EF-125322]","We would like to thank thousands of volunteers who participated in both New York State Breeding Bird Atlases.

However, forecasts of distributional change under future climates have predominantly focused on changes in species distribution and ignored possible changes in spatial and temporal patterns of dominance. We develop forecasts of spatial changes for the distribution of species dominance, defined in terms of basal area, and for species occurrence, in response to sea level rise for three tree taxa within an extensive mangrove ecosystem in northern Australia. Three new metrics are provided, indicating the area expected to be suitable under future conditions (E-occupied), the instability of suitable area (E-instability) and the overlap between the current and future spatial distribution (E-overlap). The current dominance and occurrence were modelled in relation to a set of environmental variables using boosted regression tree (BRT) models, under two scenarios of seedling establishment: unrestricted and highly restricted. While forecasts of spatial change were qualitatively similar for species occurrence and dominance, the models of species dominance exhibited higher metrics of model fit and predictive performance, and the spatial pattern of future dominance was less similar to the current pattern than was the case for the distributions of species occurrence. This highlights the possibility of greater changes in the spatial patterning of mangrove tree species dominance under future sea level rise. Under the restricted seedling establishment scenario, the area occupied by or dominated by a species declined between 42.1% and 93.8%, while for unrestricted seedling establishment, the area suitable for dominance or occurrence of each species varied from a decline of 68.4% to an expansion of 99.5%. As changes in the spatial patterning of dominance are likely to cause a cascade of effects throughout the ecosystem, forecasting spatial changes in dominance provides new and complementary information in addition to that provided by forecasts of species occurrence.",,,,"Vesk, Peter/AAG-9970-2020; Liedloff, Adam C/D-7004-2011","Vesk, Peter/0000-0003-2008-7062; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950",Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; National Environmental Research Program (NERP) Decisions Hub; Australian Research Council Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT 100100819]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council,"BC was supported by an Australian Postgraduate Award and the National Environmental Research Program (NERP) Decisions Hub.

In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects fitness at the margins of the species' distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.",,,,,"Duputie, Anne/0000-0003-2213-7940",ANR EVORANGEFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-PEXT-011]; ANR MeCCFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-ADAP-006_02],"This research was funded by ANR EVORANGE (ANR-09-PEXT-011) and ANR MeCC (ANR-13-ADAP-006_02).

The model was based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) in combination with multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique. This optimization mechanism involved the parameter setting in the MARS training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. PSO-MARS-based models, which are based on the statistical learning theory, were successfully used here to predict the Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration (output variable) as a function of the following input variables: pH, optical density, oxygen concentration, nitrate concentration, phosphate concentration, salinity, water temperature and irradiance. Regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and a determination coefficient of 0.99 was obtained. The PSO-MARS-based model goodness of fit to experimental data (Chl-a concentration) confirmed the good performance of this model. Indeed, it is well- known that Chl-a is an extremely important biomolecule, critical in photosynthesis, which allows plants to obtain energy from light and it is one of the most often used algal biomass estimator. The model also allowed to know the most influent parameters in the growth of the S. platensis. Finally, conclusions of this study are exposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Thus far, studies of thermal reaction norm variation have focused on geographically driven adaptation among different latitudes, altitudes or habitats. Yet, thermal variability is a function of both space and time. For organisms that reproduce at different times of year, such variation has the potential to promote adaptive variability in thermal responses for critical early life stages. Using common-garden experiments, we examined the spatial scale of genetic variation in thermal plasticity for early life-history traits among five populations of endangered Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that spawn at different times of year. Patterns of plasticity for larval growth and survival suggest that population responses to climate change will differ substantially, with increasing water temperatures posing a considerably greater threat to autumn-spawning cod than to those that spawn in winter or spring. Adaptation to seasonal cooling or warming experienced during the larval stage is suggested as a possible cause. Furthermore, populations that experience relatively cold temperatures during early life might be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Substantial divergence in adaptive traits was evident at a smaller spatial scale than has previously been shown for a marine fish with no apparent physical barriers to gene flow (similar to 200 km). Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of intraspecific variation in reproductive timing on thermal adaptation when forecasting the effects of climate change on animal populations.",,,,,"Oomen, Rebekah/0000-0002-2094-5592; Hutchings, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1572-5429",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Loblaw Companies Ltd; Canadian Wildlife Federation,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council through Strategic and Discovery Grants to J.A.H. and a Canada Graduate Scholarship to R.A.O.; Loblaw Companies Ltd; and the Canadian Wildlife Federation.,,,15,15,0,29,,,,2051-1434,,,CONSERV PHYSIOL,Conserv.

We focus on identifying patterns and relationships between common ant species (representing 99% of total ant records) richness and functional diversity; modelling how these patterns may change at local and regional scales in future climatic conditions; and interpreting how these changes might influence ant-mediated ecosystem processes. Location Forested ecosystems of eastern North America. Methods We used a previously published dataset to evaluate functional diversity at 67 sites in the eastern U.S. and quantified 14 taxonomic, morphometric and natural history traits for 70 common ant species in the region. We used functional diversity metrics, functional groups and species distribution modelling methods to address our aims. We used stacked species distribution models and stacked functional group models to predict species assemblages and functional richness at the 67 sites and at a regional scale for current and future climatic conditions. Results Species richness and functional diversity are positively correlated throughout the region. Under future climate scenarios, species richness and functional group richness were predicted to decrease in southern ecoregions and increase in northern ecoregions. This may be due to increased thermal stress for species in the southern extent of their ranges and increased habitat suitability in the northern ecoregions. Decomposers, arthropod community regulators and seed dispersers are forecast to be the most threatened ant functional groups.

Whereas these strategies can both be evolutionarily stable, they predict conflicting optimal behaviors when population abundance is in decline. In such a case, foragers employing an energy-maximizing strategy should reduce their use of low-quality patches as interference competition becomes less intense for high-quality patches. Foragers using a site fidelity strategy, however, should continue to use familiar patches. Because natural fluctuations in population abundance provide the only non-manipulative opportunity to evaluate adaptation to these evolutionary forces, few studies have examined these foraging strategies simultaneously. Using abundance and space use data from a free-ranging bison (Bison bison) population living in a meadow-forest matrix in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, we determined how individuals balance the trade-off between site fidelity and energy-maximizing patch choice strategies with respect to changes in population abundance. From 1996 to 2005, bison abundance increased from 225 to 475 and then decreased to 225 by 2013. During the period of population increase, population range size increased. This expansion involved the addition of relatively less profitable areas and patches, leading to a decrease in the mean expected profitability of the range. Yet, during the period of population decline, we detected neither a subsequent retraction in population range size nor an increase in mean expected profitability of the range. Further, patch selection models during the population decline indicated that, as density decreased, bison portrayed stronger fidelity to previously visited meadows, but no increase in selection strength for profitable meadows. Our analysis reveals that an energy-maximizing patch choice strategy alone cannot explain the distribution of individuals and populations, and site fidelity is an important evolutionary force shaping animal distribution. Animals may not always forage in the richest patches available, as ecological theory would often predict, but their use of profitable patches is dependent on population dynamics and the strength of site fidelity.

Here, we present the results from comparing remotely- vs. field-generated outputs from the LEFT tool on two distinct study areas for beta-diversity and distribution of threatened species (vulnerability), the two fields computed by LEFT for which such an approach is feasible. The comparison method consists of a multivariate measure of similarity between two fields based on discrete wavelet transforms, and reveals consistent agreement across a wide range of spatial scales. These results suggest that remote assessment tools such as LEFT hold great potential for determining key ecological features across landscapes and for being utilized in preplanning biodiversity assessment tools.",,,,"Macias-Fauria, Marc/A-4591-2009","Macias-Fauria, Marc/0000-0002-8438-2223; Jeffers, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9679-5909; Caithness, Neil/0000-0002-6234-4285; Seddon, Alistair/0000-0002-8266-0947",Statoil; Operation Wallacea; Oxford Martin School (Biodiversity Institute); Oxford Martin School (Oxford Martin Program on Resource Stewardship),"The authors acknowledge funding for this project from Statoil, Operation Wallacea and the Oxford Martin School (Biodiversity Institute and the Oxford Martin Program on Resource Stewardship), and interesting and helpful discussions and collaboration with GBIF and members of the Biodiversity Institute, Oxford.

Severe die-offs may be caused by natural catastrophes such as disease outbreaks and extreme climates, or human-caused disturbances such as toxic spills. Forecasting potential impacts of such disturbances is difficult and highly uncertain due to unknown future conditions, including population status and environmental conditions at the time of impact. Here, we present a framework for quantifying the range of potential population-level effects of catastrophic events based on a hindcasting approach. A dynamic population model with Bayesian parameter estimation is used to simulate the impact of severe (50-99%) mortality events during the early life stages of Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), an abundant marine fish population of high economic value. We quantify the impact of such die-offs in terms of subsequent changes in population biomass and harvest through direct comparison of simulated and historical trends, and estimate the duration of the impact as a measure of population resilience. Our results demonstrate strong resilience to catastrophic events that affect early life stages owing to density dependence in survival and a broad population age structure. Yet, while population recovery is relatively fast, losses in harvest and economic value can be substantial. Future research efforts should focus on long-term and indirect effects via food web interactions in order to better understand the ecological and economic ramifications of catastrophic mortality events.",,,,"Ohlberger, Jan/H-3262-2019","Ohlberger, Jan/0000-0001-6795-240X",VISTA - Statoil,"We thank staff and scientists at the Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (PINRO) for collecting data on cod eggs and larvae as well as the temperature records of the Kola section.

Previous efforts to forecast climate effects on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) habitat have generally assumed uniform air-water temperature relationships over large areas that cannot account for groundwater inputs and other processes that operate at finer spatial scales. We developed regression models that accounted for groundwater influences on thermal sensitivity from measured air-water temperature relationships within forested watersheds in eastern North America (Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA, 78 sites in nine watersheds). We used these reach-scale models to forecast climate change effects on stream temperature and brook trout thermal habitat, and compared our results to previous forecasts based upon large-scale models. Observed stream temperatures were generally less sensitive to air temperature than previously assumed, and we attribute this to the moderating effect of shallow groundwater inputs. Predicted groundwater temperatures from air-water regression models corresponded well to observed groundwater temperatures elsewhere in the study area. Predictions of brook trout future habitat loss derived from our fine-grained models were far less pessimistic than those from prior models developed at coarser spatial resolutions. However, our models also revealed spatial variation in thermal sensitivity within and among catchments resulting in a patchy distribution of thermally suitable habitat. Habitat fragmentation due to thermal barriers therefore may have an increasingly important role for trout population viability in headwater streams. Our results demonstrate that simple adjustments to air-water temperature regression models can provide a powerful and cost-effective approach for predicting future stream temperatures while accounting for effects of groundwater.",,,,"Hitt, Nathaniel/Y-6541-2019","Hitt, Nathaniel/0000-0002-1046-4568; Young, John/0000-0002-4500-3673",U.S. Geological Survey Northeast Climate Science Center,"Funding for this work was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey Northeast Climate Science Center in support of the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative.

Related to high sea surface temperatures (SST), bleaching events are expected to increase as a consequence of future global warming. However, response to climate change is still uncertain as future low-latitude climatic conditions have no present-day analogue. Sea surface temperatures during the Eocene epoch were warmer than forecasted changes for the coming century, and distributions of corals during the Eocene may help to inform models forecasting the future of coral reefs. We coupled contemporary and Eocene coral occurrences with information on their respective climatic conditions to model the thermal niche of coral reefs and its potential response to projected climate change. We found that under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, the global suitability for coral reefs may increase up to 16% by 2100, mostly due to improved suitability of higher latitudes. In contrast, in its current range, coral reef suitability may decrease up to 46% by 2100. Reduction in thermal suitability will be most severe in biodiversity hotspots, especially in the Indo-Australian Archipelago.

Throughout an exhaustive bibliographic survey and with the aid of Geographic Information Systems tools, this study tracks the species dispersion from its native range, including the description of important physical and environmental barriers. Additional analyses were conducted to examine possible influences of latitudinal/temperature gradients on important traits (e.g. life span, maximum and mean body length, growth at the end of first year). Altitude and winter minimum temperature appear to be delaying the invasion worldwide, but it seems inevitable that the species will spread across the globe. Latitude and summer temperature show a relationship with growth and life span.

The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons.

That is particularly true for stream fishes and cold-water species like trout, salmon, and char that are already constrained to high elevations and latitudes. The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across >250000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonidsbull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy (>0.9) were predicted to exist (33-68 BT refugia; 917-1425 CT refugia). Most refugia are on public lands (>90%) where few currently have protected status in National Parks or Wilderness Areas (<15%). Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks. Using cold water as a climate shield' is generalizable to other species and geographic areas because it has a strong physiological basis, relies on nationally available geospatial data, and mines existing biological datasets.

We also analyzed the representation of these species in protected areas. The ensemble forecasts from niche-based models indicated that 91-100% of species may reduce their range size under full and no dispersal scenarios, including five species that are currently threatened. The large range reduction (average 63%) suggests these mountain species may be threatened by climate change. The strong effects due to range species losses are predicted in the humid mountain forests of Bolivia. The representation of bird species also decreased in protected areas. Partial gap species (94-86%) are expected to increase over the present (62%). This suggests climate change and other non-climate stressors should be incorporated in conservations plans for the long-term persistence of these species.

Urbanised coastlines are associated with broad-scale loss of kelp canopies and their replacement by less productive mats of algal turf, a trend predicted to accelerate under ocean acidification and warming (i.e. enhanced CO2 and temperature). Here we use kelp forests as a model system to test whether efforts to maintain key species interactions can maintain habitat integrity under forecasted conditions. First, we assessed whether increasing intensity of local human activity is associated with more extensive turf mats and sparser canopies via structured field observations. Second, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that intact canopies can resist turf expansion under enhanced CO2 and temperature in large mesocosms. In the field, there was a greater proportion of turf patches on urbanised coasts of South Australia than in agricultural and urban catchments in which there was a greater proportion of canopy-forming algae. Mesocosm experiments revealed this expansion of turfs is likely to accelerate under increases in CO2 and temperature, but may be limited by the presence of intact canopies. We note that even in the presence of canopy, increases in CO2 and temperature facilitate greater turf covers than occurs under contemporary conditions. The influence of canopy would likely be due to shading of the understorey turfs which, in turn, can modify their photosynthetic activity. These results suggest that resistance of habitat to change under human-dominated conditions may be managed via the retention of key species and their interactions. Management that directly reduces the disturbance of habitat-forming organisms (e.g. harvesting) or reverses loss through restoration may, therefore, reinforce habitat resistance in an increasingly stressful world.

Despite great advances in international REDD+ negotiations, there is a lack of consensus around the development of business-as-usual (BAU) reference scenarios or baselines to derive and quantify net carbon emission reductions. In this paper, we explore a novel approach for developing baselines (point forecasts) using exponential smoothing. Further, we introduce the concept of probabilistic BAU scenario ranges developed using this approach. We compare predictive performance with the linear trend and historical averages approaches conventionally used in policy proposals and REDD+ pilots. Weempirically test the relative performance of all three approaches by forecasting BAU baselines and scenario ranges in 36 sites (consisting of 20 countries and 8 Amazonian states with and 8 countries without REDD+ schemes). Based on two predictive performance measures (the root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error), we find that exponential smoothing outperforms the linear trend and historical average models at predicting forest cover changes. In addition, we show how prediction intervals based on a desired confidence level generated through exponential smoothing can be used in novel ways to determine likely baseline scenario ranges. In this way it is possible to quantify the degree of variability and uncertainty in datasets. Importantly, this also provides a statistical measure of confidence to determine if REDD+ interventions have been effective. By generating robust probabilistic baseline scenarios, exponential smoothing models can facilitate the effectiveness of REDD+ payments, support a more efficient allocation of scarce conservation resources, and improve our understanding of effective forest conservation investments, also beyond REDD+.

Community predictions may be achieved using macroecological properties of communities (macroecological models, MEM), or by stacking of individual species distribution models (stacked species distribution models, S-SDMs). To obtain more realistic predictions of species assemblages, the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework suggests applying successive filters to the initial species source pool, by combining different modelling approaches and rules. Here we provide a first test of this framework in mountain grassland communities. LocationThe western Swiss Alps. MethodsTwo implementations of the SESAM framework were tested: a probability ranking' rule based on species richness predictions and rough probabilities from SDMs, and a trait range' rule that uses the predicted upper and lower bound of community-level distribution of three different functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, and seed mass) to constrain a pool of species from binary SDMs predictions. ResultsWe showed that all independent constraints contributed to reduce species richness overprediction. Only the probability ranking' rule allowed slight but significant improvements in the predictions of community composition. Main conclusionsWe tested various implementations of the SESAM framework by integrating macroecological constraints into S-SDM predictions, and report one that is able to improve compositional predictions. We discuss possible improvements, such as further understanding the causality and precision of environmental predictors, using other assembly rules and testing other types of ecological or functional constraints.",,,,"Fernandes, Rui F./V-8768-2017; D'Amen, manuela/K-4170-2015; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020; D'Amen, Manuela/L-8272-2016; Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015","Fernandes, Rui F./0000-0002-8578-5665; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; D'Amen, Manuela/0000-0001-5910-4267; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A-125145]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [GOCE-CT-2007-036866]; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU) [SESAM-ZOOL 327987],"We are grateful to the numerous people who contributed to the data collection and to Pascal Vittoz and Glenn Litsios for insightful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

Moreover, because climate greatly influences soil processes, climate change and atmospheric N deposition must both be taken into account when analysing the evolution of forest ecosystem status over time. Dynamic biogeochemical models have been developed to test different climate and atmospheric N deposition scenarios and their potential interactions in the long term. In this study, the ForSAFE model was used to predict the combined effect of atmospheric N deposition and climate change on two temperate forest ecosystems in France dominated by oak and spruce, and more precisely on forest soil biogeochemistry, from today to 2100. After a calibration step and following a careful statistical validation process, two atmospheric N deposition scenarios were tested: the current legislation in Europe (CLE) and the maximum feasible reduction (MFR) scenarios. They were combined with three climate scenarios: current climate scenario, worst-case climate scenario (A2) and best-case climate scenario (B1). The changes in base saturation and inorganic N concentration in the soil solution were compared across all scenario combinations, with the aim of forecasting the state of acidification, eutrophication and forest ecosystem recovery up to the year 2100. Simulations highlighted that climate had a stronger impact on soil base saturation, whereas atmospheric deposition had a comparative effect or a higher effect than climate on N concentration in the soil solution. Although deposition remains the main factor determining the evolution of N concentration in soil solution, increased temperature had a significant effect. Results also highlighted the necessity of considering the joint effect of both climate and atmospheric N deposition on soil biogeochemistry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The commonly available prediction models are physically based numerical approach or data-driven approach. However, these models are sometimes restricted by the lack of an explicit representation function or by insufficient data. The present research aimed to develop forecasting models that provide early warning on cyanobacteria outbreaks, as well as understand the ecological thresholds and relationships that determine such events, by means of evolutionary computation. The Lake Taihu, which has been suffering from severe cyanobacteria blooms over the last decades due to eutrophication, was taken as study case. Two modelling approaches were used based on water quality data collected from 31 monitoring sites from 2008 to 2012. First, eight sampling sites representing spatially different environmental conditions across Lake Taihu were selected to develop 2-day ahead forecasting models. The resulting models well-matched the timing and magnitude of the observed cyanobacteria dynamics for all eight sites, which was reflected by coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.62 for eastern site 24 being least favourable to cyanobacteria growth and 0.83 for north-western site 6 being most favourable. The sensitivity analyses revealed inhibitory relationships with nitrate at water temperatures greater than 18 degrees C and excitatory relationships with phosphate at lower water temperatures for most sites, which suggested N-limitation of the lake existed locally in summer and autumn. Second, the aggregated data from all 31 sites were used to develop a generic 2-day ahead forecasting model. When compared with the observed cyanobacteria data of the eight selected sampling sites, the generic model achieved slightly lower coefficients of determination than the site-specific models, with the lowest r(2) value for site 24 (0.36) and the highest r(2) value for site 6 (0.77). The sensitivity analysis for the generic model revealed a much lower water temperature threshold of 13.01 degrees C, above which N-limitation for cyanobacteria growth was indicated. Overall, both the spatially-explicit models and the generic model were suitable for early warning of cyanobacteria blooms at most sampling sites, and specified understanding on the environmental conditions that favour cyanobacteria growth across Lake Taihu.

However, few models can predict the future consequences of browsing for example, their effect on the development of the species composition of a tree stand. When a certain threshold of browsing intensity is reached, a particular silvicultural target - such as a mixed species forest - may be jeopardized. In this work, we present a model approach that addresses the question of how many individual trees will survive under the impact of ungulates, and thus, predicts possible tree regeneration failure. The model considers complex interactions between ungulates and tree saplings which are based on commonly used assumptions derived from a review of the literature. The model is based on a stochastic process including browsing percentages, hazard times (years until saplings are no longer endangered due to browsing) and browsing tolerances of tree saplings. A negative binomial distribution of browsing events is used to simulate leader shoot browsing of a regeneration area. The use of this type of distribution is an innovation we have implemented in order to consider spatially clustered browsing occurrences instead of a random binomial distribution models normally take into account. In comparison with alternative modelling approaches that are quite complex due to the input parameters used, we see advantages of using our model to predict browsing-induced regeneration failure of tree species, both for practical reasons and due to the plausibility of the results obtained. This type of model enables the prediction of the expected loss of admixed tree species under browsing and is an important first step in evaluating economic losses. Using the more clustered distribution type to indicate browsing events, predicts higher levels of damage than obtained using a random browsing component. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ectotherms are taxa considered highly sensitive to rapid climate warming. This is because body temperature profoundly governs their performance, fitness and life history. Yet, while several modelling approaches currently predict thermal effects on some aspects of life history and demography, they do not consider how temperature simultaneously affects developmental success and offspring phenotypic performance, two additional key attributes that are needed to comprehensively understand species responses to climate warming. 2. Here, we developed a stepwise, individual-level modelling approach linking biophysical and developmental models with empirically derived performance functions to predict the effects of temperature-induced changes to offspring viability, phenotype and performance, using green sea turtle hatchlings as an ectotherm model. Climate warming is expected to particularly threaten sea turtles, as their life-history traits may preclude them from rapid adaptation. 3. Under conservative and extreme warming, our model predicted large effects on performance attributes key to dispersal, as well as a reduction in offspring viability. Forecast sand temperatures produced smaller, weaker hatchlings, which were up to 40% slower than at present, albeit with increased energy stores. Conversely, increases in sea surface temperatures aided swimming performance. 4. Our exploratory study points to the need for further development of integrative individual-based modelling frameworks to better understand the complex outcomes of climate change for ectotherm species. Such advances could better serve ecologists to highlight the most vulnerable species and populations, encouraging prioritization of conservation effort to the most threatened systems.",,,,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017; Jessop, Tim/Q-2473-2019; Booth, David/A-7184-2012; Dempster, Tim/E-9630-2011","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Jessop, Tim S./0000-0002-7712-4373; Booth, David/0000-0002-3801-0488; Dempster, Tim/0000-0001-8041-426X; Kelly, Ella/0000-0001-9204-7516",Mazda Foundation; Holsworth Grants,"Funding was provided by a Mazda Foundation Grant to TSJ, TD, EK and CC, and Holsworth Grants to EK and CC.

Species distribution models (SDM) are appropriate tools for assessing the relationship between species distribution and environmental conditions, so being customarily used to forecast the biogeographical response of species to climate change. A serious limitation of species distribution models when forecasting the effects of climate change is that they normally assume that species behavior and climatic tolerances will remain constant through time. In this study, we propose a new methodology, based on fuzzy logic, useful for incorporating the potential capacity of species to adapt to new conditions into species distribution models. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to include different behavioral responses of species when predicting the effects of climate change on species distribution. Favorability models offered in this study show two extremes: one considering that the species will not modify its present behavior, and another assuming that the species will take full advantage of the possibilities offered by an increase in environmental favorability. This methodology may mean a more realistic approach to the assessment of the consequences of global change on species' distribution and conservation. Overlooking the potential of species' phenotypical plasticity may under- or overestimate the predicted response of species to changes in environmental drivers and its effects on species distribution. Using this approach, we could reinforce the science behind conservation planning in the current situation of rapid climate change.",,,,"Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010; Marquez, Ana Luz/K-8345-2014","Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284; Marquez, Ana Luz/0000-0001-5586-9334","Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Spanish National Park's Network [1098/2014]","This work has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Spanish National Park's Network, project 1098/2014.

Using a stage-structured host-pathogen model parameterized and cross-validated from a unique 15-year data set, we show how stochastic population fluctuations can lead to predictable dynamics of SNV in deer mice. Significant variation in host abundance and the basic reproductive number of the virus results in intermittent crossing of the critical host population density necessary for SNV endemicity and frequent local extinctions. When environmental conditions favor growth of the host population above the threshold, host-pathogen interactions lead to delayed density dependence in reservoir prevalence.

Fitting models of population dynamics to field data is challenging because most data sets are characterized by observation error, which can inflate estimates of process variation if ignored. Recently, state-space models have been developed to deal with this problem by directly modeling both the observation error and the ecological process of interest. Conventional state-space models, however, have several important limitations: (1) they assume that random effects are Gaussian distributed, which implies that abundance can be negative and that false positive observation errors are equally likely as false negative errors; (2) they do not admit spatial variation in population dynamics; and (3) some of the parameters of the model are not estimable. We demonstrate how each of these problems can be resolved using a class of hierarchical models proposed by Dail and Madsen (2011) that attributes observation error to imperfect detection. We expand this class of models to accommodate classical growth models (e.g., exponential and Ricker-logistic), zero-inflation, and random effects. We also present methods for forecasting population size under future environmental conditions. Implementation of these ideas is possible using either frequentist or Bayesian methods, as demonstrated by accompanying R and JAGS code. Results of a simulation study suggest that bias is negligible and coverage nominal in most cases for the proposed model extensions. An analysis of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey highlights how these methods can be readily applied to existing data, but it also suggests that precision will be low when direct information about detection probability (such as is collected using distance sampling or replicated counts) is lacking.",,,,"Chandler, Richard/F-9702-2016; Hostetler, Jeffrey A./A-3345-2011","Hostetler, Jeffrey A./0000-0003-3669-1758",U.S. National Park Service; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; USGS's Breeding Bird Survey program,"We thank J.

These present threats to biodiversity, as they promote population declines and local species extinctions. This implies that ecological communities will need to rely more strongly on recovery processes, such as recolonization from a meta-community context. It is poorly understood how differences in extreme event intensity change the outcome of subsequent community reassembly and if such extremes modify the biotic environment in ways that would prevent the successful re-establishment of lost species. We studied replicated aquatic communities consisting of algae and herbivorous rotifers in a design that involved a control and two different heat wave intensity treatments (29 degrees C and 39 degrees C). Animal species that suffered heat-induced extinction were subsequently re-introduced at the same time and density, in each of the two treatments. The 39 degrees C treatment led to community closure in all replicates, meaning that a previously successful herbivore species could not re-establish itself in the postheat wave community. In contrast, such closure never occurred after a 29 degrees C event. Heat wave intensity determined the number of herbivore extinctions and strongly affected algal relative abundances. Re-introduced herbivore species were thus confronted with significantly different food environments. This ecological legacy generated by heat wave intensity led to differences in the failure or success of herbivore species re-introductions. Reassembly was significantly more variable, and hence less predictable, after an extreme heat wave, and was more canalized after a moderate one. Our results pertain to relatively simple communities, but they suggest that ecological legacies introduced by extremely high-temperature events may change subsequent ecological recovery and even prevent the successful re-establishment of lost species. Knowing the processes promoting and preventing ecological recovery is crucial to the success of species re-introduction programs and to our ability to restore ecosystems damaged by environmental extremes.",,,,,,DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)German Research Foundation (DFG) [VO 1669/1-1],This work was funded through a DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant (VO 1669/1-1).,,,8,8,1,40,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In arid and semiarid regions, climate change and human water use pose significant threats to the future persistence of aquatic biota whose populations typically depend on permanent refuge waterholes for their viability. As such, habitats are increasingly being lost as a result of decreasing runoff and increasing water extraction. We constructed a spatially explicit population model for golden perch Macquaria ambigua (Richardson), a native freshwater fish in the Murray-Darling Basin in eastern Australia. We then used the model to examine the effects of increased aridity, increased drought frequency, and localized human water extraction on population viability. Consistent with current observations, the model predicted golden perch population persistence under the current climate and levels of water use. Modeled increases in local water extraction greatly increased the risk of population decline, while scenarios of increasing aridity and drought frequency were associated with only minor increases in this risk. We conclude that natural variability in abundances and high turnover rates (extinction/recolonization) of local populations dictate the importance of spatial connectivity and periodic cycles of population growth. Our study also demonstrates an effective way to examine population persistence in intermittent and ephemeral river systems by integrating spatial and temporal dynamics of waterhole persistence with demographic processes (survival, recruitment, and dispersal) within a stochastic modeling framework. The approach can be used to help understand the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers, including water resource development, on the viability of biota inhabiting highly dynamic environments.",,,,"Balcombe, Stephen/C-5237-2008; Bond, Nick/A-1129-2016","Balcombe, Stephen/0000-0002-0085-7851; Bond, Nick/0000-0003-4294-6008; Crook, David/0000-0003-4035-050X",,,,,17,18,5,90,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

A common form of available data for a PVA is population counts through time. Previous research has suggested that improving estimates of population trends and risk from count data depends on longer observation periods, but that is often impractical or undesirable. Making multiple observations within a single time step is an alternative way to gather more data without extending the observation period. In this paper, we examine the trade-off between the length of the time period over which observations of the population have been taken and the total number of observations or samples that have been recorded through an analysis of simulated data. We found that when the ratio of process error to measurement error variance is high, more precise estimates of quasi-extinction risks can be obtained if replicated observations are taken at each time step, but when the ratio is low, replicated observations add little benefit in improving precision. These results can be used to efficiently design effective monitoring schemes for species of conservation concern.",,,,,,"Washington Sea Grant Program, University of Washington [NA08OAR4170761, E/I-1]","The authors would like to thank Jennifer Ruesink, Andre Punt, Ray Hilborn, and Eric Ward for their valuable ideas, reviews and input.

A surplus of energy can create thermal discomfort and be detrimental to human health. Many cities in warm regions all over the world are forecast to become very hot through global climate change. Some cities already experience extreme heat and have done so for centuries. We conducted a study of one such city in order to generate design guidelines for creating thermally comfortable outdoor places. In the hot, dry city of Lahore, Pakistan we compared the microclimates of two very different outdoor spaces. The first place was the 16th century Shalimar Garden, which contains much green infrastructure and water features. The other example was the hard-surfaced courtyard of the contemporary Alhamra Art Centre. In both places we measured the microclimatic characteristics and used those data to simulate thermal sensation through the energybudget model COMFA. The measured air temperature and humidity in both spaces was similar. However, the solar radiation that would be received by a person in the Alhamra courtyard was much higher than in Shalimar Garden and was the main determinant of thermal discomfort. Results from this study can inform other cities in hot, dry climates about design responses that provide more outdoor thermal comfort and prevent health-threatening heat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have explicitly modeled the effects of these interactions on rates of vegetation change, despite such information being critical to forecasting temporal patterns in vegetation dynamics. In this study, we build and parameterize rate-change models for three dominant alpine life forms using data from a 7-year warming experiment. These models allowed us to examine how the interactions between experimental warming, the abundance of bare ground (a measure of past disturbance) and neighboring life forms (a measure of life form interaction) affect rates of cover change in alpine shrubs, graminoids and forbs. We show that experimental warming altered rates of life form cover change by reducing the negative effects of neighboring life forms and positive effects of bare ground. Furthermore, we show that our models can predict the observed direction and rate of life form cover change at burned and unburned long-term monitoring sites. Model simulations revealed that warming in unburned vegetation is expected to result in increased forb and shrub cover and decreased graminoid cover. In contrast, in burned vegetation, warming is predicted to slow post-fire regeneration in both graminoids and forbs and facilitate rapid expansion in shrub cover. These findings illustrate the applicability of modeling rates of vegetation change using experimental data. Our results also highlight the need to account for both disturbance and the abundance of other life forms when examining and forecasting vegetation dynamics under climatic change.",,,,"Vesk, Peter/AAG-9970-2020; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011","Vesk, Peter/0000-0003-2008-7062; Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; JARRAD, FRITH/0000-0003-4081-1310; Camac, James/0000-0003-4785-0742","Australian Research Council Linkage Grants, through the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Parks VictoriaAustralian Research Council; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environment Decisions (CEED) and Holsworth Wildlife Research CommitteeAustralian Research Council; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government","This research was funded through Australian Research Council Linkage Grants, partnered through the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Parks Victoria and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk obtained through bioclimatic envelope models calibrated with native species distribution data can play a critical role in invasive species management. Forecasts of invasion risk to novel environments, however, remain controversial. Here, we assess how species' association with human-modified habitats in the native range and within-taxon niche structure shape the distribution of invasive populations at biogeographical scales and influence the reliability of predictions of invasion risk. LocationAfrica, Asia and Europe. MethodsWe use similar to 1200 native and invasive ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) occurrences and associated data on establishment success in combination with mtDNA-based phylogeographic structure to assess niche dynamics during biological invasion and to generate predictions of invasion risk. Niche dynamics were quantified in a gridded environmental space while bioclimatic models were created using the biomod2 ensemble modelling framework. ResultsRing-necked parakeets show considerable niche expansion into climates colder than their native range. Only when incorporating a measure of human modification of habitats within the native range do bioclimatic envelope models yield credible predictions of invasion risk for parakeets across Europe. Invasion risk derived from models that account for differing niche requirements of phylogeographic lineages and those that do not achieve similar statistical accuracy, but there are pronounced differences in areas predicted to be susceptible for invasion. Main conclusionsInformation on within-taxon niche structure and especially association with humans in the native range can substantially improve predictive models of invasion risk.

Tree cover modifies the local abiotic conditions below the canopy, notably by reducing light availability, and thus, also the performance of species that are not adapted to low-light conditions. However, this local effect may propagate to coarser spatial grains, by affecting colonisation probabilities and local extinction risks of herbs and shrubs. To assess the effect of tree cover at both the plot- and landscape-grain sizes (approximately 10-m and 1-km), we fit generalised linear models (GLMs) for the plot-level distributions of 960 species of herbs and shrubs using 6935 vegetation plots across the European Alps. We ran four models with different combinations of variables (climate, soil and tree cover) at both spatial grains for each species. We used partial regressions to evaluate the independent effects of plot- and landscape-grain tree cover on plot-level plant communities. Finally, the effects on species-specific elevational range limits were assessed by simulating a removal experiment comparing the species distributions under high and low tree cover. Accounting for tree cover improved the model performance, with the probability of the presence of shade-tolerant species increasing with increasing tree cover, whereas shade-intolerant species showed the opposite pattern. The tree cover effect occurred consistently at both the plot and landscape spatial grains, albeit most strongly at the former. Importantly, tree cover at the two grain sizes had partially independent effects on plot-level plant communities. With high tree cover, shade-intolerant species exhibited narrower elevational ranges than with low tree cover whereas shade-tolerant species showed wider elevational ranges. These findings suggest that forecasts of climate-related range shifts for herb and shrub species may be modified by tree cover dynamics.",,,,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019; Lenoir, Jonathan/AAE-8441-2019; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Willner, Wolfgang/AAA-4822-2019; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/E-6588-2016; Lugilde, Diego Nieto/A-2617-2009; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Lenoir, Jonathan/0000-0003-0638-9582; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Willner, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1591-8386; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/0000-0002-4623-0894; Lugilde, Diego Nieto/0000-0003-4135-2881; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Pauli, Harald/0000-0002-9842-9934; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887; Vittoz, Pascal/0000-0003-4218-4517; Theurillat, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-1843-5809",Univ. de Granada (Spain); European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC]; European Research Council under the European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [281422]; Aarhus Univ.; Aarhus Univ.

This major change in vegetation cover is likely sustained by positive feedbacks with the physical environment. Recent research has focused on a feedback with microclimate, whereby cold intolerant shrubs increase the minimum nocturnal temperatures in their surroundings. Despite the rich literature on the impact of land cover change on local climate conditions, changes in microclimate resulting from shrub expansion into desert grasslands have remained poorly investigated. It is unclear to what extent such a feedback can affect the maximum extent of shrub expansion and the configuration of a stable encroachment front. Here, we focus on the case of the northern Chihuahuan desert, where creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) has been replacing grasslands over the past 100-150years. We use a process-based coupled atmosphere-vegetation model to investigate the role of this feedback in sustaining shrub encroachment in the region. Simulations indicate that the feedback allows juvenile shrubs to establish in the grassland during average years and, once established, reduce their vulnerability to freeze-induced mortality by creating a warmer microclimate. Such a feedback is crucial in extreme cold winters as it may reduce shrub mortality. We identify the existence of a critical zone in the surroundings of the encroachment front, in which vegetation dynamics are bistable: in this zone, vegetation can be stable both as grassland and as shrubland. The existence of these alternative stable states explains why in most cases the shift from grass to shrub cover is found to be abrupt and often difficult to revert.",,,,"D'Odorico, Paolo/A-5836-2008","D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; De Wekker, Stephan/0000-0002-6343-854X", [NSF-DEB-0743678],This research was supported by NSF-DEB-0743678.

This study concentrates on two years, 2007 and 1996, with different arctic sea ice conditions and tundra fire activity. The year of 2007 is characterized by a low summer sea ice extent (second lowest) and high tundra fire activity, while 1996 had high sea ice extent, and few tundra fires. Atmospheric lateral boundary forcing from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis drove the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, along with varying sea ice surface forcing designed to delineate the role of sea ice. WRF runs successfully reproduced the differences between 1996 and 2007. Surprisingly, replacing sea ice conditions in 1996 run by those from 2007 and vice versa (2007 run with 1996 sea ice) did not change the overall picture. The atmospheric circulation in August of 1996 included a significant low-pressure system over the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. However, in 2007, a high-pressure system dominated the circulation over the Beaufort Sea. It is argued that this difference in large-scale patterns, rather than retreat of sea ice, was responsible for anomalously dry and warm atmospheric conditions over the North Slope in summer and autumn 2007, suitable for high tundra fire activity. Circulation in 2012 is contrasted with that in 2007 to further stress its importance for local weather on the North Slope. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

Practical applications are, however, limited due to discrepancies between attraction of insects to lures in the laboratory and in the field. We hypothesised that the background odour of the crop along with the modality of release of volatiles in the field could play a role in filling the gap. Our study system comprised the apple fruit moth Argyresthia conjugella, its native host, rowan, Sorbus aucuparia, and the recurrently colonised secondary host apple, Malus communis. The attractiveness of several sources, including host plants, their collected headspaces and synthetic mimics, was measured both in the laboratory and in the field. In orchards, apple fruit moth females and males were caught in traps baited with rowan clusters. In the wind tunnel, attraction was observed when rowan (either as plant or headspace) was used as stimulus. The background from apple did not affect the attraction to the rowan odour. Whilst the response to a two-component rowan mimic decreased in the presence of an apple background, a seven-component mimic remained effective in such a background. In rowan intermast years, traps baited with this blend caught consistent numbers of moths during their migration to apple. Long lasting dispensing devices with a controlled release over the entire period of pest migration allowed a much more consistent catch of moths compared to a standard device. Results indicate that knowledge of the volatile background of the crop and of the optimisation of the dispensing device is essential when moving attractants from the laboratory or semi-laboratory environment out into the field. By considering these factors, we developed a plant volatile-based attractant to monitor the apple fruit moth and use insecticides only where and when needed. Our concept can be extended to other insect-plant interactions.",,,,"Tasin, Marco/J-5907-2012",,"Norwegian Agricultural Authority, Bioforsk [159095]; Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research [H1156188]","This study was financed by the Norwegian Agricultural Authority (SLF project #159095), Bioforsk and The Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research (SLF Project #H1156188).

Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data.

To timely design adequate measures, information is needed about the feasibility of nature targets under a future climate. Habitat distribution models may provide this, but current models have certain drawbacks: they apply indirect empirical relationships between habitat and vegetation, they often disregard spatially explicit information about groundwater, and they are designed for too coarse spatial scales. We introduce a model that explicitly takes into account spatial effects through groundwater and that can easily be adapted to new scientific approaches and the needs of end-users. It combines (spatially explicit) data sources, transfer functions derived from mechanistic models, and robust relationships between habitat factors and plant characteristics. Outputs are maps showing the occurrence probabilities of vegetation types and their associated conservation values, both on a spatial scale that fits the needs of nature managers and spatial planners. The model was applied to a catchment of 270 km(2) to forecast, on a 25 m resolution, the effects of a national climate scenario (related to IPCC A2 and A1B). Computation time was a couple of minutes on a standard PC. Severe loss was predicted for wet and mesotrophic species-rich grasslands, while vegetation of dry and acidic soils appeared to profit.

Nevertheless, little is known about long-term variation in salmon migration timing for multiple species across broad regions. We used long-term data for five Pacific salmon species throughout rapidly warming southeast Alaska to describe long-term changes in salmon migration timing, interannual phenological synchrony, relationships between climatic variation and migratory timing, and to test whether long-term changes in migration timing are related to glaciation in headwater streams. Temporal changes in the median date of salmon migration timing varied widely across species. Most sockeye populations are migrating later over time (11 of 14), but pink, chum, and especially coho populations are migrating earlier than they did historically (16 of 19 combined). Temporal trends in duration and interannual variation in migration timing were highly variable across species and populations. The greatest temporal shifts in the median date of migration timing were correlated with decreases in the duration of migration timing, suggestive of a loss of phenotypic variation due to natural selection. Pairwise interannual correlations in migration timing varied widely but were generally positive, providing evidence for weak region-wide phenological synchrony. This synchrony is likely a function of climatic variation, as interannual variation in migration timing was related to climatic phenomenon operating at large- (Pacific decadal oscillation), moderate- (sea surface temperature), and local-scales (precipitation). Surprisingly, the presence or the absence of glaciers within a watershed was unrelated to long-term shifts in phenology. Overall, there was extensive heterogeneity in long-term patterns of migration timing throughout this climatically and geographically complex region, highlighting that future climatic change will likely have widely divergent impacts on salmon migration timing. Although salmon phenological diversity will complicate future predictions of migration timing, this variation likely acts as a major contributor to population and ecosystem resiliency in southeast Alaska.",,,,,,USGS Mendenhall Fellowship programUnited States Geological Survey; Alaska EPSCoR NSF award [OIA-1208927],"We thank the numerous field technicians and weir operators from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who collected these data.

Consequently, the effects of invasive species can be hard to forecast owing to the diversity of interaction-pathways and number of species they can potentially affect. Ultimately, the strength and direction of an invader's inter-specific effects will be determined by both the traits of the invader and the species they interact with. The cane toad (Rhinella marina) is a highly successful invasive species that poses a serious threat to ecosystem integrity in tropical Australia. Reptilian predators have been particularly affected by the invasion of cane toads because toads possess toxins that are novel to native Australian predators. We used a meta-regression approach to explore how cane toads' impacts on Australian squamates are modulated by their phylogenetic, behavioural and morphological traits. Species primarily foraging in riparian and terrestrial habitats tended to decline in abundance while population sizes of arboreal squamates might have increased following toad arrival. The negative impact of cane toads on anurophagous squamates scaled with gape size and body mass. Squamate species with smaller heads or body mass tended to increase in abundance while species with larger heads or body mass tended to decline. Our study provides insight into the complexity of impacts that invasive species can have on native species assemblages and highlights how morphological and behavioural factors can mediate the impact of invasive on native species.",,,,,"Letnic, Michael/0000-0003-4191-8427",Hermon Slade Foundation; Mazda Foundation,"We thank Christopher Turbill, Andrew Letten, Anna Feit and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

This warming and drying can negatively affect perennial vegetation and lead to the degradation of ecosystem properties. To better understand these detrimental effects, we formulate a conceptual model of dryland ecosystem vulnerability to climate change that integrates hypotheses on how plant species will respond to increases in temperature and drought, including how plant responses to climate are modified by landscape, soil and plant attributes that are integral to water availability and use. We test the model through a synthesis of fifty years of repeat measurements of perennial plant species cover in large permanent plots across the Mojave Desert, one of the most water-limited ecosystems in North America. Plant species ranged in their sensitivity to precipitation in different seasons, capacity to increase in cover with high precipitation and resistance to decrease in cover with low precipitation. Our model successfully explains how plant responses to climate are modified by biophysical attributes in the Mojave Desert. For example, deep-rooted plants were not as vulnerable to drought on soils that allowed for deep-water percolation, whereas shallow-rooted plants were better buffered from drought on soils that promoted water retention near the surface.Synthesis. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding climate-vegetation relationships in the context of biophysical attributes that influence water availability and provide an important forecast of climate-change effects, including plant mortality and land degradation in dryland regions throughout the world.",,,,"Nussear, Ken/AAF-6723-2020; Beever, Erik/Q-3869-2019; Veblen, Kari E./D-1439-2012","Beever, Erik/0000-0002-9369-486X; Veblen, Kari E./0000-0001-7523-3368; Nussear, Ken/0000-0002-3849-8911",U.S. Geological Survey Status and Trends Program; National Park Service,"The authors thank Helen Raichle, Margaret Snyder, Mike Duniway and Janel Brackin for their technical assistance and funding from the U.S. Geological Survey Status and Trends Program and the National Park Service.",,,20,20,3,129,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

PPC can play an important role in the functioning of the food webs and can modulate their metabolism in response to environmental changes. Most of the information available on PPC concerns open waters but this overview seeks to examine the existing literature on the diversity and ecology of these prokaryotes in coastal and brackish environments. Some recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a large number of picocyanobacterial strains, but their structural diversity (taxonomy) is still largely unknown. Genomics is greatly enhancing our knowledge of picocyanobacterial genetic diversity, but without complementary cytomorphological, ecophysiological and biochemical analyses, correct taxonomic classification cannot be achieved. As coastal environments provide a wide range of goods and services, managers need information on environmental quality and how they can preserve it. Together with other planktonic microbes, PPC are potentially useful as sensitive environmental indicators.

However, how local species interactions scale-up to large spatial scales and how they contribute to shape species distributions and diversity patterns at macroecological extents remains less clear. Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure. Addressing these key topics and achieving a better integration between these two research fields will significantly advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multispecies interactions. This could also help to develop more realistic forecasts of changes in biodiversity under climate and land use change.",,,,"Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X","Univ. of Amsterdam (UvA); Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlichkonomischer Exzellenz (LOEWE) of the Hesse Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and the Arts","We thank Christopher Lortie and Jens-Christian Svenning for inviting us to present our ideas at the Nordic Society Oikos symposium 'A critical study of biodiversity studies' during the INTECOL 2013 conference in London, UK.

We used extreme hot weather periods to investigate the potential impact of climate change on cyanobacteria abundance in three large and deep peri-alpine lakes, Lakes Geneva, Annecy, and Bourget. Between 2000 and 2011, there were four extreme warm weather periods: spring and summer 2003, autumn 2006 and winter 2007. We found that the consequences of extreme air temperatures on cyanobacteria abundance and phytoplankton composition depend on the time of year in which the extreme temperatures occur. In all three lakes studied, a warm summer did not clearly promote cyanobacteria blooms, whereas a warm autumn promoted cyanobacteria growth in the mesotrophic Lakes Geneva and Bourget, but not in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy. A warm winter was associated with high cyanobacteria abundance and a high contribution of cyanobacteria to total phytoplankton biomass. Our results reinforce the idea that lakes have an ecological memory by showing that a warm winter can influence subsequent seasonal succession in the cyanobacteria community. In both mesotrophic lakes studied, cyanobacteria abundance was strongly influenced by phosphorus concentrations and winter air temperatures. We conclude that although extreme hot weather periods can be used to analyze various aspects of the impacts of climate change, they are of limited value in forecasting the structure of phytoplankton communities in a warmer future.",,,,"RIMET, Frederic/S-2702-2018; Domaizon, Isabelle/A-2517-2011","RIMET, Frederic/0000-0002-5514-869X; Domaizon, Isabelle/0000-0001-9785-3082; Kerimoglu, Onur/0000-0003-4289-4404",University of Savoie,"Data for Lake Geneva, Lake Annecy, and Lake Bourget were collected as part of regular sampling carried out by the CIPEL, SILA, and CISALB, respectively.

However, they do not explore the mechanisms underlying biological processes, making it difficult to predict shifts outside the environmental gradient where the model was trained. In this study, we combine correlative SDMs and knowledge on physiological limits to provide more robust predictions. The thermal thresholds obtained in growth and survival experiments were used as proxies of the fundamental niches of two foundational marine macrophytes. The geographic projections of these species' distributions obtained using these thresholds and existing SDMs were similar in areas where the species are either absent-rare or frequent and where their potential and realized niches match, reaching consensus predictions. The cold-temperate foundational seaweed Himanthalia elongata was predicted to become extinct at its southern limit in northern Spain in response to global warming, whereas the occupancy of southern-lusitanic Bifurcaria bifurcata was expected to increase. Combined approaches such as this one may also highlight geographic areas where models disagree potentially due to biotic factors. Physiological thresholds alone tended to over-predict species prevalence, as they cannot identify absences in climatic conditions within the species' range of physiological tolerance or at the optima. Although SDMs tended to have higher sensitivity than threshold models, they may include regressions that do not reflect causal mechanisms, constraining their predictive power.

Here, we examine global patterns in the parasite assemblages of two rat species and explore the role of parasite acquisition from local pools of host species. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe compiled a global data set of helminth parasites (n=241 species) from two rat species (Rattus rattus species complex, R.norvegicus) and, concomitantly, from all other mammal species known to be infected by the same parasites. We used an inverse Bayesian modelling approach to explicitly link species-level to community-level infestation probabilities at different geographic scales and alleviate the shortcoming of sampling bias. ResultsPatterns of species richness and turnover of parasites in the two focal rat species revealed clear biogeographic structure with lowest species richness and most distinct assemblages in Madagascar and highest species richness and least distinct assemblages in the Palaearctic region. Parasite species richness and turnover across regions were correlated for the two focal hosts, although they were associated with distinct assemblages within regions. Infection probability of a focal host with any given parasite was clearly related to infection probability of the local species pool of wildlife hosts with that same parasite. Infection probability of other mammal species infected with these parasite species, in turn, decreased with their taxonomic distance to the genus Rattus. Main conclusionsOur study demonstrates the importance of spillover of parasites from local wildlife hosts to invasive rats on global patterns of host-parasite associations. Considering both changes in local pools of host species and the global distributions of parasite and pathogen diversity in consistent model frameworks may therefore advance the forecasting of species-level infestation patterns and the possible risk of disease emergence from local to global scale.",,,,"Morand, Serge/M-5433-2018; Ribas, Alexis/K-4201-2017; Wells, Konstans/A-7232-2010; O'Hara, Bob/A-7499-2008","Morand, Serge/0000-0003-3986-7659; Wells, Konstans/0000-0003-0377-2463; O'Hara, Bob/0000-0001-9737-3724; Ribas, Alexis/0000-0002-1256-3316",,,,,30,31,2,49,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

To improve the basis for managing these key ecosystems, we selected a Tertiary relict woodland (Argania spinosa) in order to clarify the sensitivity to long-term climate change (the present, the past glacial-interglacial cycle and under future scenarios). We also discuss the impact of long-term human land use for the distribution of dry woodlands in North Africa. Location: North Africa, Methods: To assess whether the argan woodland is in equilibrium with current climate, we used species distribution modelling (SUM) to estimate its potential range. Then, SDM was used to estimate its potential distribution during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21,000 BP) and the Middle Holocene (Mid-Holocene; 6,000 BP). Model predictions for past scenarios were compared with Quaternary palaeorecords to evaluate their accuracy. Finally, we forecasted changes in the potential range to year 2080 to assess its likely future range dynamics. Results: At the LGM, suitable areas occurred at more southern latitudes, where the Sahara Desert currently lies, while suitable areas in the Mid-Holocene shifted northwards, occupying areas similar to those of today. The estimated past distributions are consistent with palaeorecords, providing evidence for the important role of Quaternary climate changes in driving dry woodland range dynami.cs. The current range-filling constitutes 44% of the potential distribution, probably primarily reflecting anthropic land-use effects. Future climate change is forecast not to cause latitudinal/altitudinal range shifts, but rather an overall range contraction. Conclusions: The models reflect the high sensitivity of the dry woodland ecosystem to past climate changes, in agreement with palaeorecords. The estimated climatic sensitivity also predicts severe range contraction during future climate change. Consequently, management strategies for dry woodlands should be developed to facilitate their in situ survival, particularly by reducing the currently intensive human pressure.",,,,"ALBA-SANCHEZ, FRANCISCA/E-7927-2010; Lugilde, Diego Nieto/A-2617-2009; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019","ALBA-SANCHEZ, FRANCISCA/0000-0003-0387-1533; Lugilde, Diego Nieto/0000-0003-4135-2881; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862","Spanish Consolider Program [CSD2007-00058]; Excellence Research Projects Program from the Andalusian Government [RNM-7033]; Research Projects Plan from UGR [PP2012-PI02]; Plan Nacional + D + i [HAR2008-06477-C03-03/HIST, CGL2011-30512-C02-01]; Universidad de Granada (Spain); European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC]; Danish Council for Independent Research, Natural SciencesDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [12-125079]","We are indebted to the Spanish Consolider Program (CSD2007-00058), Excellence Research Projects Program from the Andalusian Government (RNM-7033), Research Projects Plan from UGR (PP2012-PI02), as well as HAR2008-06477-C03-03/HIST and CGL2011-30512-C02-01 projects (Plan Nacional + D + i) for financial and technical support.

MIMES integrate diverse types of knowledge and elucidate how benefits from ecosystem services are gained and lost. In MIMES, users formalize how materials are transformed between natural, human, built, and social capitals. This information is synthesized within a systems model to forecast ecosystem services and human-use dynamics under alternative scenarios. The MIMES requires that multiple ecological and human dynamics be specified, and that outputs may be understood through different temporal and spatial lenses to assess the effects of different actions in the short and long term and at different spatial scales. Here we describe how MIMES methodologies were developed in association with three case studies: a global application, a watershed model, and a marine application.

These terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) inputs to lakes have changed substantially in recent decades, and will likely continue to change. In this paper, we first briefly review the substantial literature describing tDOM effects on lakes and ongoing changes in tDOM inputs. We then identify and provide examples of four major challenges which limit predictions about the implications of tDOM change for lakes, as follows: First, it is currently difficult to forecast future tDOM inputs for particular lakes or lake regions. Second, tDOM influences ecosystems via complex, interacting, physical-chemical-biological effects and our holistic understanding of those effects is still rudimentary. Third, non-linearities and thresholds in relationships between tDOM inputs and ecosystem processes have not been well described. Fourth, much understanding of tDOM effects is built on comparative studies across space that may not capture likely responses through time. We conclude by identifying research approaches that may be important for overcoming those challenges in order to provide policy- and management-relevant predictions about the implications of changing tDOM inputs for lakes.",,,,"Fork, Megan L./AAG-8474-2019; Solomon, Chris/E-6284-2014","Fork, Megan L./0000-0002-7789-3316; Solomon, Chris/0000-0002-2850-4257; Buffam, Ishi/0000-0002-2625-6640",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0842441]; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of Norway [224779/E10]; Andrew W.

Understanding how such species have responded to past glacial cycles can help us forecast their response to today's changing climate. Gray whales are among those marine species likely to be strongly affected by Arctic climate change, but a thorough analysis of past climate impacts on this species has been complicated by lack of information about an extinct population in the Atlantic. While little is known about the history of Atlantic gray whales or their relationship to the extant Pacific population, the extirpation of the Atlantic population during historical times has been attributed to whaling. We used a combination of ancient and modern DNA, radiocarbon dating and predictive habitat modelling to better understand the distribution of gray whales during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Our results reveal that dispersal between the Pacific and Atlantic was climate dependent and occurred both during the Pleistocene prior to the last glacial period and the early Holocene immediately following the opening of the Bering Strait. Genetic diversity in the Atlantic declined over an extended interval that predates the period of intensive commercial whaling, indicating this decline may have been precipitated by Holocene climate or other ecological causes. These first genetic data for Atlantic gray whales, particularly when combined with predictive habitat models for the year 2100, suggest that two recent sightings of gray whales in the Atlantic may represent the beginning of the expansion of this species' habitat beyond its currently realized range.",,,,"Hofreiter, Michael/A-3996-2017; Czechowski, Paul/M-4749-2019; van der Plicht, Johannes/B-9994-2013","Hofreiter, Michael/0000-0003-0441-4705; Czechowski, Paul/0000-0001-7894-4042; Turvey, Stuart/0000-0003-1599-1065; Kaschner, Kristin/0000-0002-4061-626X; Shapiro, Beth/0000-0002-2733-7776",Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [310763],"We gratefully acknowledge the following individuals for providing samples, assistance and expertise: Charley Potter and Jim Mead (NMNH), Phil Clapham and Robert L.

With climate change forecasts for more frequent and extensive drought in the future, a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that determine differential ecosystem sensitivity to drought is needed. In 2012, the Central US experienced the fourth largest drought in a century, with a regional-scale 40 % reduction in growing season precipitation affecting ecosystems ranging from desert grassland to mesic tallgrass prairie. This provided an opportunity to assess ecosystem sensitivity to a drought of common magnitude in six native grasslands. We tested the prediction that drought sensitivity is inversely related to mean annual precipitation (MAP) by quantifying reductions in aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Long-term ANPP data available for each site (mean length = 16 years) were used as a baseline for calculating reductions in ANPP, and drought sensitivity was estimated as the reduction in ANPP per millimeter reduction in precipitation. Arid grasslands were the most sensitive to drought, but drought responses and sensitivity varied by more than twofold among the six grasslands, despite all sites experiencing 40 % reductions in growing season precipitation. Although drought sensitivity generally decreased with increasing MAP as predicted, there was evidence that the identity and traits of the dominant species, as well as plant functional diversity, influenced sensitivity. A more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms leading to differences in drought sensitivity will require multi-site manipulative experiments designed to assess both biotic and abiotic determinants of ecosystem sensitivity.",,,,"Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; Collins, Scott/Y-6888-2019; Smith, Melinda D/J-8987-2014; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008","Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892; Komatsu, Kimberly/0000-0001-7056-4547","US Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Climate Change, Soils and Emissions Program; US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1021559]; NSF Macrosystems Biology Program; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Kansas State University; University of New Mexico","We thank technicians and scientists at the Konza Prairie, Shortgrass Steppe and the Sevilleta LTER sites for collecting, managing and sharing data, and the scientists associated with the Prairie Heating and Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (PHACE) project in Cheyenne.

Conversely, variations in temperature seldom are related to patterns of ANPP. Thus forecasting responses to warming is a challenge, and raises the question: how sensitive will grassland ANPP be to warming? We evaluated climate and multi-year ANPP data (67 years) from eight western US grasslands arrayed along mean annual temperature (MAT; similar to 7-14 A degrees C) and mean annual precipitation (MAP; similar to 250-500 mm) gradients. We used regression and analysis of covariance to assess relationships between ANPP and temperature, as well as precipitation (annual and growing season) to evaluate temperature sensitivity of ANPP. We also related ANPP to the standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), which combines precipitation and evapotranspiration to better represent moisture available for plant growth. Regression models indicated that variation in growing season temperature was negatively related to total and graminoid ANPP, but precipitation was a stronger predictor than temperature. Growing season temperature was also a significant parameter in more complex models, but again precipitation was consistently a stronger predictor of ANPP. Surprisingly, neither annual nor growing season SPEI were as strongly related to ANPP as precipitation. We conclude that forecasted warming likely will affect ANPP in these grasslands, but that predicting temperature effects from natural climatic gradients is difficult. This is because, unlike precipitation, warming effects can be positive or negative and moderated by shifts in the C-3/C-4 ratios of plant communities.",,,,"Smith, Melinda D/J-8987-2014; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008; Collins, Scott/Y-6888-2019; Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014","Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892; Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Vermeire, Lance/0000-0001-9147-0099","US Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Climate Change, Soils and Emissions Program; US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1021559]; NSF Macrosystems Biology Program","We thank Dr Ann Hess, Colorado State University, for her significant assistance with the statistical analysis.

We conducted a 5-year restoration experiment, replicated across 9 sites spanning 3 soil parent material types within a 9,000-ha Pinus ponderosa forest landscape. We evaluated plant community response to restoration Pinus thinning, grazing, and aqueous smoke application. We measured vegetation before (2003) and 3 (2006) and 5 (2008) years after treatment. Plant community responses of species richness, cover, and composition were diverse, ranging from increases, decreases, or no change depending on soil parent material, tree thinning, and presence or exclusion of grazing. Restoration outcomes were under hierarchical control: soil parent material constrained response to Pinus thinning, which in turn influenced grazing effects. On limestone-derived soil, responses included no change in species richness but increased plant cover with Pinus thinning. Both plant richness and cover increased on benmorite soil after thinning, and cover generally increased more without grazing. On rocky, basalt soil, plant richness increased but cover did not after any treatment. Diversity of responses to restoration has implications for: (1) setting goals or monitoring indicators tailored to inherent soil capability; (2) identifying where grazing most affects restoration outcomes; and (3) forecasting responses to restoration across landscapes. Diverse responses to restoration along physiographic gradients such as soil parent material warrant consideration when developing restoration across degraded landscapes.",,,,,,Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI); U.S. Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,"We thank the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) and U.S. Forest Service for funding; D.

Understanding their large-scale and long-term dynamics is necessary to develop effective control and management strategies. Occupancy models represent a promising approach to unravel interactions between environmental factors and spatiotemporal dynamics of outbreaking populations. Here, we investigated population dynamics of the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, using density data collected between 1988 and 2010 by the Australian Plague Locust Commission over more than 3 million km(2) in eastern Australia. We applied multistate and autologistic multi-season occupancy models to test competing hypotheses about environmental and demographic processes affecting the large-scale dynamics of the Australian plague locust. We found that rainfall and land cover predictors best explained the spatial variability in outbreak probability across eastern Australia. Outbreaks are more likely to occur in temperate than tropical regions, with a faster and more continuous response to rainfall in desert than in agricultural areas. Our results also support the hypothesis that migration tends to propagate outbreaks only locally (over distances lower than 400 km) rather than across climatic regions. Our study suggests that locust outbreak forecasting and management systems could be improved by implementing key environmental factors and migration in hierarchical spatial models. Finally, our modeling framework can be seen as a step towards bridging the gap between mechanistic and more phenomenological models in the spatial analysis of fluctuating populations.",,,,"Piry, Sylvain/Q-6206-2019","Piry, Sylvain/0000-0002-7717-7555; Simpson, Stephen J./0000-0003-0256-7687",Australian Research Council Linkage grantAustralian Research Council [LP0669080],We are grateful to M-P.

We examined how the legacies of prefire ecosystem structure may explain the variation in soil trajectories during the first decade following wildfire. Five years prior to wildfire in a southwestern Oregon forest dominated by mature Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco], ecosystem structure was experimentally manipulated by thinning or clearcutting for comparison with unthinned forest. Repeated measurements of replicated experimental units were made before wildfire and during the first decade following wildfire. In the unthinned forest, the O-horizon soil C and N pools were decreased to 24-39% of prefire levels by wildfire, then increased to 53-70% during the first year postwildfire by deposition of fire-killed needles from overstory trees. The mineral soil (0-6 cm depth) C pool was decreased by wildfire, then increased in the following decade, while no change in the N pool was detected. In contrast, in the clearcut treatment, the O-horizon soil C and N pools were nearly totally consumed during the wildfire, lacked fire-killed overstory as a source of needle and fine and coarse wood inputs, but regained 20% of prefire masses in the following decade via foliar and root inputs from regenerated shrubs and herbaceous vegetation. Surface mineral soil C and N pools were decreased 35-50% by wildfire and showed no sign of recovery during the following decade. In contrast to wildfire, unburned ecosystem structures showed no changes in O horizon and increased mineral-soil N pool in the clearcut. We propose a conceptual model of soil C and N response following wildfire that includes legacy influences resulting from prefire ecosystem structures: residual live trees that generate continual litterfall and root turnover; fire-killed trees that produce needle-fall, dead roots, and fine- and coarse-wood detritus; and surviving roots and burls that contribute to postwildfire shrub regeneration. Consideration of prefire ecosystem structure and legacies in quantitative models may improve forecasts of postwildfire C budgets at stand to regional scales.",,,,,,"Oregon [DW 12936179]; Joint Fire Sciences Program [03-2-3-09, 10-1-10-18]; National Commission for Science on Sustainable Forestry [C4]","This paper is a contribution of the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station's Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity Program.

Growing evidence indicates that freshwater ecosystems may be as important as terrestrial and marine environments in the annual flux of CO2 to the atmosphere. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Stream Ecological Observatory Network (STREON) offer the opportunity to collect and analyze data related to these processes at spatial scales ranging from local to continental and at temporal scales from minutes to millennia. These data can be used to understand how global climate change and subsequent shifts in terrestrial plant communities and precipitation regimes will influence the export and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to headwater streams, downstream freshwater ecosystems, and coastal environments. Moreover, temporal scaling of DOM export among watersheds is an underexploited frontier research area throughout the earth sciences.

We studied zooplankton-feeding little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel species of the Arctic, at their northernmost breeding site in Franz-Josef Land (80 degrees N), Russian Arctic. We tested the hypothesis that little auks still benefit from pristine arctic environmental conditions in this remote area. To this end, we analysed remote sensing data on sea-ice and coastal glacier dynamics collected in our study area across 1979-2013. Further, we recorded little auk foraging behaviour using miniature electronic tags attached to the birds in the summer of 2013, and compared it with similar data collected at three localities across the Atlantic Arctic. We also compared current and historical data on Franz-Josef Land little auk diet, morphometrics and chick growth curves. Our analyses reveal that summer sea-ice retreated markedly during the last decade, leaving the Franz-Josef Land archipelago virtually sea-ice free each summer since 2005. This had a profound impact on little auk foraging, which lost their sea-ice-associated prey. Concomitantly, large coastal glaciers retreated rapidly, releasing large volumes of melt water. Zooplankton is stunned by cold and osmotic shock at the boundary between glacier melt and coastal waters, creating new foraging hotspots for little auks. Birds therefore switched from foraging at distant ice-edge localities, to highly profitable feeding at glacier melt-water fronts within <5km of their breeding site. Through this behavioural plasticity, little auks maintained their chick growth rates, but showed a 4% decrease in adult body mass. Our study demonstrates that arctic cryosphere changes may have antagonistic ecological consequences on coastal trophic flow.

Non-native species have had less time than co-occurring native species to expand their ranges following introduction, so non-native ranges may under-represent suitable conditions. Therefore it is often assumed that species distribution models will predict disproportionately smaller potential ranges for non-natives than natives. We compare the distributions of native, endemic, alien and invasive plants to determine how the different range attributes of these groups might influence ecological forecasting. LocationContinental USA. MethodsWe compared the geographic ranges of 13,575 plant species (9402 native, 2397 endemic, 1201 alien and 755 invasive) using (1) US only and (2) global distribution data from herbarium records. We calculated US longitudinal and latitudinal range extents as potential indicators of range-limiting factors, modelled potential range based on climate using principal components analysis, and calculated occupancy of potential ranges (range infilling). ResultsContrary to expectations, modelled potential ranges were significantly larger for non-natives than natives, even for species with few occurrences. Distributions of native species, not invasive species, appeared strongly limited longitudinally. However, invasive plants occupied substantially less area within their climatically suitable ranges than native plants (lower range infilling). Main conclusionsInvasive plant distributions were consistently broader, both climatically and geographically, than comparable native species. This suggests that invasive plant distribution models at regional scales are not underpredicting potential ranges relative to models for native species. In contrast, the comparatively limited longitudinal ranges of native species suggest a high degree of non-climatic limitation, which is likely to cause distribution models to underpredict the potential ranges of native species. Invasive plants have not achieved the degree of range infilling expected relative to natives. Thus, plants introduced to the US still have plenty of space to invade.",,,,"Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008","Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971",Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [RC-1722]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BPD/63195/2009],"We thank J.

In this research, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and the rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis were employed to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of precipitation variations during the crop growth period over 1960 to 2009. The results indicated the following: (1) annual precipitation increased slightly over the period of 1960-2009 but decreased significantly (at the 5% significance level) since 2001. An increasing trend was observed in the northern region, while a decreasing trend was observed in the southern region; (2) five regions with different precipitation variation patterns were identified in the crop growth period, including the northern, the northeastern, the southwestern, the western, and the southernmost end patterns; (3) overall, a slightly increasing trend was identified in summer over the study period. Over the period of 2000-2009, precipitation in the summer and autumn decreased, (the strongest decreasing trend was observed in the autumn). Unlike that of the whole area, precipitation in the northern region decreased insignificantly in summer and increased slightly in autumn. Results of this study may facilitate the prevention of potential disasters (e.g., abnormal precipitation) and the reduction of the associated losses through early warning and forecasting of variation trends of regional precipitation.

Indeed, it represents one of the key assumptions underlying species distribution models (SDMs), the main tool currently available for predicting range shifts of species. However, to date, no comprehensive assessment of niche conservatism is available for the marine realm. We use the invasion by Indo-Pacific tropical fishes into the Mediterranean Sea, the world's most invaded marine basin, to examine the conservatism of the climatic niche. We show that tropical invaders may spread far beyond their native niches and that SDMs do not predict their new distributions better than null models.

Here we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the field setting.

Due to the importance of C-4 grasses for carbon and surface energy fluxes, numerous models have been proposed to describe their spatial distribution and forecast their responses to climate change. These models often rely on broad climatic predictors (e.g. temperature and precipitation) but fail to integrate other ecologically relevant factors like disturbance and competition, which may modify realized C-3/C-4 grass distributions. Here, we present a combined evaluation of the contribution of ecological factors and climatic predictors to realized C-3/C-4 grass distributions. We consider multiple biogeographic regions of North America using a multisource database of over 40,000 vegetation plots. Location: The conterminous United States of America (USA). Methods: We identified a comprehensive pool of climatic models in the literature and used information theoretic criteria to select a primary climatic predictor of C-3 and C-4 grass distributions. Subsequently, the best model was combined with ecological predictors (e.g. fire, tree cover) using a multiple regression framework and tested within eight regions. Results: Surprisingly, grass-dominated communities across the USA exist largely in C-3- or C-4-dominated states. Transitions between C-3/C-4 dominance were best explained by models that integrated temperature and precipitation with ecological factors that varied according to region. For some regions, like Eastern Temperate Forests, local ecological factors were comparable in strength to broad-scale climatic predictors of C-3/C-4 abundance. Main: conclusionLocal ecological factors modify C-3/C-4 grass responses to broad-scale climatic drivers in ways that manifest at regional scales. In Eastern Temperate Forests, for example, C-4 grass abundances are maintained below climatic expectations where tree cover creates light limitation but above expectations where frequent fires reduce tree cover. Thus, local ecological factors, which vary among biogeographic regions, contribute to large-scale climate disequilibrium.",,,,,"Stromberg, Caroline/0000-0003-0612-0305; Griffith, Daniel/0000-0001-7463-4004","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0907738]; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [EF-0905606]; NESCentNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)","We thank Matthias Schmid, Florian Wickler and Simone Wahl for providing R code and discussion of Boosted Beta Regression.

A key challenge at the interface of community ecology and conservation biology is to predict how direct and indirect effects combine to influence response in a changing environment. In particular, little is known about how direct and indirect effects on biodiversity develop over time or their potential to influence ecosystem function. We studied how nitrogen (N), winter precipitation (snow) and warming influenced diversity and ecosystem function over 6years in alpine tundra. We used path analyses to partition direct effects of environmental manipulations from indirect effects due to changes in the abundance of two dominant plants. We hypothesize that (i) indirect effects will develop more slowly but will become stronger than direct effects over time and (ii) after 6years, indirect effects will more strongly influence diversity while direct effects will influence ecosystem function. Indirect effects of N on diversity were consistently stronger than direct effects and actually developed quickly, prior to direct effects. Direct effects of snow on diversity were detected in year 2 but then subsequently were reversed, while indirect effects were detected in year 4 and grew stronger over time. Overall in year 6, indirect effects were much stronger than direct effects on diversity. Direct effects predominated for three of four ecosystem functions we measured (productivity, N mineralization, winter N availability). The only indirect effects we found were that N and snow indirectly affected microbial biomass N by influencing Geum abundance. Across all four ecosystem measures, indirect effects were infrequent and weaker than direct effects.Synthesis. Increasing indirect effects on diversity over time indicate that short-term experiments or monitoring of natural systems may underestimate the full magnitude of global change effects on plant communities. Moreover, explicitly accounting for changes in dominant plant abundance may be necessary for forecasting plant community response to environmental change. Conversely, weak indirect effects for ecosystem processes suggest that predicting ecosystem function without knowledge of plant responses to global change may be possible.",,,,"Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017; Farrer, Emily/AAD-4639-2020","Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; Farrer, Emily/0000-0001-8003-8831; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919569, DEB-0423662, DEB-1027341]","We thank Krista Beckley, Kurt Chowanski, Adam Formica, Eva Franzova, Yvette Gault, Liana Nichols, Julia Reich, Charlotte Riggs, Keishla Rodriguez, Trang Pham, Jane Smith, Warren Sconiers, Robert Weller and Lucas Zukiewicz for their assistance in the field.

Recent advances have integrated population dynamic processes into species distribution models (SDMs), to reduce potential biases in predictions and to better reflect the demographic nuances of incremental range shifts. However, there is no clear framework for selecting the most appropriate demographic-based model for a given data set or scientific question. We review the computer-based modelling platforms currently used for the development of either population- or individual-based species range dynamics models. We describe the features and requirements of 20 software platforms commonly used to generate simulations of species ranges and abundances. We classify the platforms according to particular capabilities or features that account for user requirements and constraints, such as (i) ability to simulate simple to complex population dynamics, (ii) organism specificity or (iii) their computational capacities. Using this classification, we develop a protocol for choosing the most appropriate framework for modelling species range dynamics based in data availability and research requirements. We find that the main differences between modelling platforms are related to the way in which they simulate population dynamics, the type of organisms they are able to model and the ecological processes they incorporate. We show that some platforms can be used as generic modelling software to investigate a broad range of ecological questions related to the range dynamics of most species, and how these are likely to change in the future in response to forecast climate and land-use change.

Our approach provides ecologists and conservation biologists with a clear method for selecting the most appropriate software platform that meets their needs when developing SDMs coupled with population-dynamic processes.

Recently, next-generation sequencing has been applied to questions about organismal history, with the promise of revolutionizing the field. However, no systematic assessment of how phylogeographic data sets have changed over time with respect to overall size and information content has been performed. Here, we quantify the changing nature of these genetic data sets over the past 20years, focusing on papers published in Molecular Ecology. We found that the number of independent loci, the total number of alleles sampled and the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per data set has improved over time, with particularly dramatic increases within the past 5years. Interestingly, uniparentally inherited organellar markers (e.g. animal mitochondrial and plant chloroplast DNA) continue to represent an important component of phylogeographic data. Single-species studies (cf. comparative studies) that focus on vertebrates (particularly fish and to some extent, birds) represent the gold standard of phylogeographic data collection. Based on the current trajectory seen in our survey data, forecast modelling indicates that the median number of SNPs per data set for studies published by the end of the year 2016 may approach similar to 20000. This survey provides baseline information for understanding the evolution of phylogeographic data sets and underscores the fact that development of analytical methods for handling very large genetic data sets will be critical for facilitating growth of the field.",,,,"Perez, Manolo Fernandez/H-2243-2012; Hyseni, Chaz/I-7633-2018; Thome, Maria Tereza/R-3476-2018; Bonatelli, Isabel A.

This paper presents a novel light use efficiency-based GPP model called the terrestrial ecosystem carbon flux model (TEC) driven by MODIS FPAR and climate data coupled with a precipitation-driven evapotranspiration (E) model (Yan et al., 2012). TEC incorporated a new water stress factor, defined as the ratio of actual E to Priestley and Taylor (1972) potential evaporation (E-PT). A maximum light use efficiency (epsilon*) of 1.8 gCMJ(-1) and 2.76 gCMJ(-1) was applied to C3 and C4 ecosystems, respectively. An evaluation at 18 eddy covariance flux towers representing various ecosystem types under various climates indicates that the TEC model predicted monthly average GPP for all sites with overall statistics of r = 0.85, RMSE = 2.20 gC m(-2) day(-1), and bias = -0.05 gC m(-2) day(-1). For comparison the MODIS GPP products (MOD17A2) had overall statistics of r = 0.73, RMSE = 2.82 gC m(-2) day(-1), and bias = -0.31 gC m(-2) day(-1) for this same set of data. In this case, the TEC model performed better than MOD17A2 products, especially for C4 plants. We obtained an estimate of global mean annual GPP flux at 128.2 +/- 1.5 Pg Cyr(-1) from monthly MODIS FPAR and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA reanalysis data at a 1.0 degrees spatial resolution over 11 year period from 2000 to 2010. This falls in the range of published land GPP estimates that consider the effect of C4 and C3 species. The TEC model with its new definition of water stress factor and its parameterization of C4 and C3 plants should help better understand the coupled climate-carbon cycle processes.

Ecological niche models (ENMs) are often used to achieve this goal, but their accuracy is limited when species niches are inadequately sampled. This problem may be tackled by combining ENM with field validation to fine-tune current species distribution, though the traditional methods are often time-consuming and the species ID inaccurate. Here we combine ENM with novel field validation methods based on non-invasive genetic sampling to forecast range shifts in the globally near-threatened Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae). Using occurrence records mapped at 10 km x 10 km resolution, we built the first ENM (ENM1) to estimate the current species distribution. We then selected 40 grid squares with no previous data along the predicted range margins, and surveyed suitable habitats through presence-sign searches. Faecal samples visually assigned to the species were collected for genetic identification based on the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene, which resulted in 19 new grid squares with confirmed presence records. The second model (ENM2) was built by adding the new data, and species distribution maps predicted by each model under current and future climate change scenarios were compared. Both models had high predictive ability, with strong influence of temperature and precipitation. Although current distribution ranges predicted by each model were quite similar, the range shifts predicted under climate change differed greatly when using additional field data. In particular, ENM1 overlooked areas identified as important by ENM2 for species conservation in the future. Overall, results suggest that combining ENM with non-invasive genetics may provide a cost-effective approach in studies regarding species conservation under environmental change.

In this study, we investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using candidate gene approach from high- and low-fecundity populations of the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens Stal (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) divergently selected for fecundity. We also tested whether the population fecundity can be predicted by a few SNPs. Seven genes (ACE, fizzy, HMGCR, LpR, Sxl, Vg and VgR) were inspected for SNPs in N. lugens, which is a serious insect pest of rice. By direct sequencing of the complementary DNA and promoter sequences of these candidate genes, 1033 SNPs were discovered within high- and low-fecundity BPH populations. A panel of 121 candidate SNPs were selected and genotyped in 215 individuals from 2 laboratory populations (HFP and LFP) and 3 field populations (GZP, SGP and ZSP). Prior to association tests, population structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the 3 field populations were analysed. The association results showed that 7 SNPs were significantly associated with population fecundity in BPH. These significant SNPs were used for constructing general liner models with stepwise regression. The best predictive model was composed of 2 SNPs (ACE(-862) and VgR(-816)) with very good fitting degree. We found that 29% of the phenotypic variation in fecundity could be accounted for by only two markers. Using two laboratory populations and a complete independent field population, the predictive accuracy was 84.35-92.39%. The predictive model provides an efficient molecular method to predict BPH fecundity of field populations and provides novel insights for insect population management.",,,,,"Fu, Yonggui/0000-0001-6469-3430",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30930061]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB126200],"We are grateful to Prof. Christian Schlotterer (Institut fur Populationsgenetik, Vetmeduni Vienna, Austria) and Prof. Xiao-Qiang Yu (University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA) for their critical comments and reading of the manuscript.

Commonly used SRRs include the Ricker, Beverton-Holt, and Cushing functional forms, which differ primarily by the degree of density-dependent effects (compensation). The degree of compensation determines whether recruitment respectively decreases, saturates, or increases at high levels of spawning stock biomass. In 1982, J.G. Shepherd united these dynamics into a single model, where the degree of compensation is determined by a single parameter. However, the difficulty in relating this parameter to biological data has limited its usefulness. Here, we use a generalized modeling framework to show that the degree of compensation can be related directly to the functional elasticity of growth, which is a general quantity that measures the change in recruitment relative to a change in biomass. We show that the elasticity of growth can be calculated from perturbations in fish biomass, is robust to observation error, and can be used to determine general attributes of the SRR in both continuous time production models, as well as discrete time age-structured models.",,,,,"Yeakel, Justin/0000-0002-6597-3511","Fisheries Ecology Division, NOAA Fisheries, Santa Cruz, CA; University of California, Santa CruzUniversity of California System; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0924195]","We thank S.

Plant species differ in foliar chemistry, and this may result in idiosyncratic plant-mediated responses of insect herbivores at elevated [CO2] and temperature. We measured the response of the eucalypt leaf beetle Paropsis atomaria (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) feeding on Eucalyptus tereticornis and Eucalyptus robusta. Seedlings were grown at ambient (400 A mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (640 A mu mol mol(-1)) [CO2] and ambient (26/18 A degrees C day/night) or elevated (ambient + 4 A degrees C) temperature in a greenhouse for 7 months. Larvae fed on flush leaves from egg hatch to pupation while being directly exposed to these conditions. Elevated [CO2] reduced foliar [N] and [P], while it increased total nonstructural carbohydrates and the C:N ratio. Elevated temperature increased foliar [N] in E. robusta but not E. tereticornis. Plant-mediated effects of elevated [CO2] reduced female pupal weight and increased developmental time and leaf consumption. Larval survival at elevated [CO2] was impacted differently by the two host plant species; survival increased on E. robusta while it decreased on E. tereticornis. Elevated temperature accelerated larval development but did not impact other insect parameters. We did not detect a CO2 x temperature interaction, suggesting that elevated temperature as a combined direct and plant-mediated effect may not be able to ameliorate the negative plant-mediated effects of elevated [CO2] on insect herbivores.

Ecological niche models are increasingly used to forecast the spatial range of introduced species in the context of climate warming. Here, we studied the potential spread of the American jackknife clam Ensis directus into European waters. E. directus, a marine bivalve native to the American coasts, was observed in Europe for the first time in the German Bight at the end of the 1970s. Afterwards, the clam quickly colonized the surrounding waters of the North Sea. Although many studies focused on its biology, ecology and colonization, the extent to which E. directus may invade European and Nordic seas remained poorly known. In this study, we used two ecological niche models (ENMs), calibrated on the native area of the mollusk, to evaluate the potential distributional range of the bivalve over European seas. Under current environmental conditions, E. directus should continue to progress towards the southern coasts of France and may also invade new areas in the Adriatic Sea. Projections for the end of the century suggest that the probability of occurrence of E. directus increases from Denmark to France with both ENMs. The Tunisian coasts may also become a new suitable area for the mollusk but the results of the two ENMs differ for this region.

Analyses focused on three steppe bird species in a protected Natura 2000 area, located in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results showed that changes in land use composition under different scenarios can have important effects on habitat suitability, but that the size of those effects would vary depending on species-specific requirements and spatial distribution of land use changes. Positive effects of some new crops in the study area (grain legumes and aromatic plants) on studied species were suggested by our analyses. A positive effect of aggregation of land use changes was also found for two of the studied species.

Often, the data or resources necessary for ecological risk assessment are incomplete or absent, leaving environmental decision makers ill equipped to effectively manage valuable natural resources. Structured expert judgment (SEJ) is a mathematical and performance-based method of eliciting, weighting, and aggregating expert judgments. In contrast to other methods of eliciting and aggregating expert judgments (where, for example, equal weights may be assigned to experts), SEJ weights each expert on the basis of his or her statistical accuracy and informativeness through performance measurement on a set of calibration variables. We used SEJ to forecast impacts of nonindigenous Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) in Lake Erie, where it is believed not to be established. Experts quantified Asian carp biomass, production, and consumption and their impact on 4 fish species if Asian carp were to become established. According to experts, in Lake Erie Asian carp have the potential to achieve biomass levels that are similar to the sum of biomasses for several fishes that are harvested commercially or recreationally. However, the impact of Asian carp on the biomass of these fishes was estimated by experts to be small, relative to long term average biomasses, with little uncertainty. Impacts of Asian carp in tributaries and on recreational activities, water quality, or other species were not addressed. SEJ can be used to quantify key uncertainties of invasion biology and also provide a decision-support tool when the necessary information for natural resource management and policy is not available. El Uso de Juicio Experto Estructurado para Predecir Invasiones de Carpas Asiaticas en el Lago Erie Resumen Identificar cuales especies no-nativas se volveran invasoras y predecir el dano que causaran es complicado y presenta un problema significativo para el manejo de recursos naturales. Con frecuencia los datos o recursos necesarios para la evaluacion de riesgo ecologico estan incompletos o son inexistentes, lo que deja mal equipados a quienes toman las decisiones ambientales para manejar efectivamente recursos naturales valiosos. El juicio experto estructurado (JEE) es un metodo con bases matematicas y de desempeno para obtener, sopesar y agregar juicios expertos. En contraste con otros metodos de obtencion y agregacion de juicios expertos (donde, por ejemplo, se le pueden asignar pesos iguales a los expertos), JEE sopesa a cada experto con base en su asertividad estadistica y capacidad de informar por medio de la medida de desempeno en un conjunto de variables de calibracion. Usamos JEE para predecir los impactos de las carpas asiaticas no-nativas Hypophthalmichthys spp. en el Lago Erie, donde se cree que no se ha establecido. Los expertos cuantificaron la biomasa, produccion y consumo de la carpa asiatica y su impacto sobre cuatro especies de peces si la carpa asiatica se llegara a establecer en el lago. De acuerdo a los expertos, en el Lago Erie, la carpa asiatica tiene el potencial de adquirir niveles de biomasa similares a la suma de biomasa de varios peces que se han cultivado comercialmente o recreativamente. Sin embargo, se estimo por los expertos que el impacto de la carpa asiatica sobre la biomasa de estos peces seria pequeno, con poca incertidumbre. Los impactos de la carpa asiatica sobre los tributarios y las actividades recreativas, la calidad del agua o sobre otras especies no se evaluaron.

Dominant threats are typically inferred by experts on the basis of a patchwork of informal methods. Transparent, quantitative diagnostic tools would contribute much-needed consistency, objectivity, and rigor to the process of diagnosing anthropogenic threats. Long-term census records, available for an increasingly large and diverse set of taxa, may exhibit characteristic signatures of specific threatening processes and thereby provide information for threat diagnosis. We developed a flexible Bayesian framework for diagnosing threats on the basis of long-term census records and diverse ancillary sources of information. We tested this framework with simulated data from artificial populations subjected to varying degrees of exploitation and habitat loss and several real-world abundance time series for which threatening processes are relatively well understood: bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) (exploitation) and Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) and Eurasian Skylark (Alauda arvensis) (habitat loss). Our method correctly identified the process driving population decline for over 90% of time series simulated under moderate to severe threat scenarios. Successful identification of threats approached 100% for severe exploitation and habitat loss scenarios. Our method identified threats less successfully when threatening processes were weak and when populations were simultaneously affected by multiple threats. Our method selected the presumed true threat model for all real-world case studies, although results were somewhat ambiguous in the case of the Eurasian Skylark. In the latter case, incorporation of an ancillary source of information (records of land-use change) increased the weight assigned to the presumed true model from 70% to 92%, illustrating the value of the proposed framework in bringing diverse sources of information into a common rigorous framework. Ultimately, our framework may greatly assist conservation organizations in documenting threatening processes and planning species recovery. Inferencia la Naturaleza de las Amenazas Antropogenicas para los Registros de Abundancia a Largo Plazo Resumen Diagnosticar los procesos que amenazan la permanencia de las especies es critico para la planeacion de la recuperacion y la prediccion de riesgos. Las amenazas dominantes se infieren comunmente por expertos con base en un collage de metodos informales. Las herramientas de diagnostico transparentes y cuantitativas podrian contribuir con la tan necesitada consistencia, objetividad y rigor para el proceso de diagnosticar amenazas antropogenicas. Los registros de censos a largo plazo, disponibles para un creciente y diverso conjunto de taxa, pueden exhibir rasgos caracteristicos de procesos especificos de amenaza y asi proporcionar informacion para la diagnosis de amenazas. Desarrollamos un marco de trabajo Bayesiano y flexible para diagnosticar amenazas con base en los registros de censos a largo plazo y diversas fuentes subsidiarias de informacion. Probamos este marco de trabajo con datos simulados de poblaciones artificiales sujetas a diferentes grados de explotacion y perdida de habitat y varias series de tiempos de abundancia reales para los cuales estan bien entendidos los procesos de amenaza: Thunnus maccoyii y Gadus morhua para la explotacion; Lagopus lagopus scotica y Alauda arvensis para la perdida de habitat. Nuestro metodo identifico correctamente el proceso conductor de la declinacion poblacional para mas del 90% de las series de tiempo simuladas bajo escenarios moderados y severos de amenaza. Nuestro metodo identifico las amenazas con menos exito cuando los procesos de amenaza eran debiles o cuando las poblaciones estaban afectadas simultaneamente por amenazas multiples. Nuestro metodo selecciono el modelo de la presunta verdadera amenaza para todos los estudios de caso reales, aunque los resultados fueron algo ambiguos en el caso de Alauda arvensis. En el ultimo caso, la incorporacion de una fuente subsidiaria de informacion (registros de cambio en el uso de suelo) incrementaron la fuerza asignada al supuesto modelo verdadero del 70% al 92%, ilustrando el valor del marco de trabajo propuesto en la contribucion de diversas fuentes de informacion para un marco de trabajo comun y riguroso.

In agricultural landscapes, the seasonal movement of the wild boar Sus scrofa towards field crops often results in damages and makes control of the population difficult. The plasticity of the species to cope with different habitats is largely proven, but the environmental and human drivers of this seasonal habitat shift at the population scale remain largely unknown. Using MaxEnt and two seasonally distinct presence datasets, we contrasted the distribution of wild boar in southern Belgium during the growing and hunting seasons to (i) analyse seasonal drivers of the distribution and (ii) forecast the potential spread of the species north to its current distribution. We demonstrated that during the growing season, wild boar range almost double, owing to the cover and food provided by agricultural areas, thereby enhancing the movement and spread of the species. We found that the seasonal distribution of wild boar in agricultural lands is mostly influenced by the search for cover and food provided alternatively by forest and field crops. Interestingly, it seems that this search for cover operates under the constraint of a threshold distance. Our results indeed reveal an increased probability of presence not only in the vicinity of forests but also above a threshold distance of 865 m from the forest edge, suggesting that wild boar can overcome the dependence to forest cover. The forecast distribution of wild boar highlighted a potential increase of the current range into suitable habitat between 63 and 168 km(2). To counteract the potential spread of the species into agricultural habitats and the consecutive damages, we insist on the need for the development of integrated management strategies, combining land use spatial configuration and wild boar spatial behaviour.",,,,"Morelle, Kevin/N-2024-2019","Morelle, Kevin/0000-0001-9041-6541",Fond National pour la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS-FRIA)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,This research was supported by the Fond National pour la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS-FRIA).

We developed a set of models to understand the role climate plays in determining wetland formation on a landscape scale and to forecast changes in wetland distribution for the Midwestern United States. These models combined 35 climate variables with 21 geographic and anthropogenic factors thought to encapsulate other major drivers of wetland distribution for the Midwest. All models successfully recreated a majority of the variation in current wetland area within the Midwest, and showed that wetland area was significantly associated with climate, even when controlling for landscape context. Inferential (linear) models identified a consistent negative association between wetland area and isothermality. This is likely the result of regular inundation in areas where precipitation accumulates as snow, then melts faster than drainage capacity. Moisture index seasonality was identified as a key factor distinguishing between emergent and forested wetland types, where forested wetland area at the landscape scale is associated with a greater seasonal variation in water table depth. Forecasting models (neural networks) predicted an increase in potential wetland area in the coming century, with areas conducive to forested wetland formation expanding more rapidly than areas conducive to emergent wetlands. Local cluster analyses identified Iowa and Northeastern Missouri as areas of anticipated wetland expansion, indicating both a risk to crop production within the Midwest Corn Belt and an opportunity for wetland conservation, while Northern Minnesota and Michigan are potentially at risk of wetland losses under a future climate.",,,,"Mitchell, Randall J/G-6380-2010","Mitchell, Randall J/0000-0001-7961-3560; Garris, Heath/0000-0003-0416-4128",Choose Ohio First Bioinformatics Scholarship Program; University of Akron Department of Biology; University of Akron Department of Geoscience; Glenny endowment,"We thank the Choose Ohio First Bioinformatics Scholarship Program, the University of Akron Departments of Biology and Geoscience, and the Glenny endowment for financial support and software licensing to complete this project.

Little is known, however, about the ways in which biotic disturbance quantitatively affects ecosystem C processes, especially those that occur below ground. We reveal the general patterns of below-ground C responses to biotic disturbance from field manipulative experiments and opportunistic events. LocationGlobal. MethodWe carried out a meta-analysis examining the effects of biotic disturbance on 16 variables associated with below-ground C processes, based on 64 experimental studies. ResultsBiotic disturbance significantly decreased below-ground C pools with relatively long residence times (e.g. root biomass and soil organic carbon, SOC), but increased labile C pools (e.g. microbial biomass carbon, MBC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC), soil respiration (Rs) and its components, and microbial population sizes. Compared with the neutral or positive effects of other environmental changes on below-ground C pools and fluxes, biotic disturbance had a negative effect on plant biomass and SOC but a larger positive effect on MBC, DOC and Rs. Main conclusionsBiotic disturbance can have stronger impacts on below-ground C processes than other environmental changes, and the sensitive responses of soil labile C pools and C fluxes to biotic disturbance decrease long-term below-ground C sequestration. More research efforts are, however, needed to reduce the uncertainties in quantifying the effects of biotic disturbance and to improve forecasting of the feedback between the carbon cycle and climate.",,,,"Zhou, Xuhui/O-5727-2019; Ju, Rui-Ting/AAD-2444-2019; Zhou, Xuhui/H-4332-2011","Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901; Ju, Rui-Ting/0000-0001-9265-8245; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370489, 31300467]; Programme for Professor of Special Appointment at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; Shanghai Pujiang ProgramShanghai Pujiang Program [12PJ1401400]; 'Thousand Young Talents' Program in China","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 31370489, 31300467), the Programme for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning, the 2012 Shanghai Pujiang Program (12PJ1401400), and the 'Thousand Young Talents' Program in China.",,,13,15,6,160,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

The results showed that the blooms activation time advanced approximately six days per decade. The onset time of algal blooms of 2080s was in February and March and the elevated concentration of chlorophyll a lasted until late autumn in the west lake region.

The model was modified prior to its application to the transport calculations. Model values of the sea currents velocities and their X and Y projections, as well as their directions were used for computation. The projections were calculated per each model cell (1852 x 1852 x 5 m), which lied on the borderline with the time resolution of 1 hour.

BCOS consists of several subsystems: POMOS, Galata, Shkorpilovtci and BulSeaL. POMOS is an observing system located in the ports (14 measuring sites, 45 instruments, 14 weather and seastate parameters), designed to provide weather and sea state operational information for the areas of major Bulgarian ports (Varna, Burgas and Balchik), intended to secure safety shipping in ports, canals and bays. Galata is a platform which provides open sea Real-time meteorological and oceanographic information from 24 sensors, measuring 31 major oceanographic and meteorological parameters. Shkorpilovtci is a coastal oceanographic station compiling: weather station, sea level gauge, UV radiation sensor and Recording Doppler Current Profiler with wave sensor. BulSeaL is a network of sea level stations including four historical sites, measuring sea level from more than 80 years. These subsystems collect real time data using various instruments and sensors placed at different strategic locations. All instruments are connected to communication system via intranet which provides direct access to the sensors. The measured data are transmitted to the central collecting system, where the information is processed and stored in database. Access to database is through intermet/intranet with the help of browsers. Actual data is controlled by Data Management System and can be displayed on the computer screens using report server supporting thereby needs of different group of users. Next future development will be to install new system which includes two moorings equipped with meteorological and oceanographic sensors as well as to install Ferry Box systems onboard cabotage vessels. The main goal of BCOS is to support sustainable development of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, and the main task is to provide operational information for the needs of: national security, civil protection, Search and Rescue, government and local authorities, port authorities, shipping, marine industry, fishery and aquaculture, tourist industry, environmental protection, coast protection, oil spills combat and other interested. BCOS real time data is one of the most important sources of multi-parameter operational oceanographic information in the Bulgarian Black Sea coast which will serve for monitoring, verification and improvement of model results and forecasts as well as for collecting long time series of data needed for climatic research, marine physics, chemistry and biology.

Biosecurity measures seek to protect those systems from accidental or intentional introductions of species that might become injurious. Pest risk maps convey how the probability of invasion by an alien species or the potential consequences of that invasion vary spatially. These maps inform strategic and tactical decisions for invasive species management. Pest risk modellers must contend with the challenges of developing models that forecast the course or consequence of invasions and are more meaningful than could be obtained by chance, of demonstrating the validity of those models and of portraying results on maps in ways that will be useful for decision makers. Frequently, these forecasts depend on extrapolations from limited information to project how a species might be affected, for example, by changes in commerce, exposure to novel environments or associations with new dispersal vectors, or how these species might affect resident species or ecological processes. Consequently, pest risk maps often focus on one phase of the invasion process: arrival, establishment, spread or impact. Risk assessors use different analytical tools and information sources to address each phase. To be certain that pest risk models and maps are fully fit for purpose, models and maps must be critically evaluated at each stage of the development process. Invariably, errors will be revealed. The International Pest Risk Mapping Workgroup has offered a number of suggestions to improve the development of pest risk models and maps.

The weather databases include historical daily weather databases for North America and the world. The templates include degree-days, generic empirical models, infection periods and the Generic Pest Forecast System (GPFS). The GPFS, currently in development, is a model that uses hourly inputs and includes modules for development rate, hot and cold mortality, population and potential damage.

One advanced feature of nappfast is cyber-infrastructure that supports the sharing of products and data between modellers and end users. The infrastructure includes tools for managing user access, uploading and correcting geographic coordinates for pest observations, and an interactive geographic information system environment for viewing input data and model products.

We use the management of Chilean needle grass (Nassella neesiana) invasion in a 260,791 km(2) part of eastern Australia as an example to describe a process-based approach for making such predictions with publicly available soft ware (e.g. Netica and ESRI products). The approach is deductive, with causal relationships captured in a Bayesian network and represented spatially at fine resolution using a geographic information system (GIS). Pest risk responses to changing environments, such as land-use change, climate change or altered flood regimes, and to management interventions can be tested through scenario analysis. Predictive risk mapping of invasive aliens is often knowledge-constrained; therefore, our approach seeks to capture the best available knowledge from often disparate sources in a transparent and explicit manner. For Chilean needle grass, we elicited process understanding from experts through a participatory approach, integrated an existing bioclimatic model and obtained our own field data. Our model, thereby, represents a hypothesis of what determines the distribution, abundance and spread of Chilean needle grass in the modelled region. Specifically, the model forecasts the likelihood of the weed reaching a threshold density (e.g. in this case, >30% ground cover) as defined by the experts. This approach to likelihood estimation contrasts with the presence/absence predictions of most other models. Modelling was done at a sufficiently fine spatial resolution (i.e. 30 m) to capture relevant invasion dynamics. Finally, we illustrate how validation can be used to give end users confidence in model predictions and to identify important knowledge gaps and uncertainties. We demonstrate how the resulting pest risk maps for Chilean needle grass can guide management decisions.",,,,"van Klinken, Rieks D/B-1772-2009","van Klinken, Rieks D/0000-0002-7578-8977",,,,,8,8,0,7,,,,,,978-1-78064-394-6,CABI INVASIVE SER,,,2015,7,,,,,,171,188,,,10.1079/9781780643946.0000,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000377029800013,,,,,

In this chapter, we explore how the perceptions of that uncertainty can be incorporated into the pest risk assessment process. Uncertainty changes a decision maker's perceptions of risk; therefore, the direct incorporation of uncertainty may provide a more appropriate depiction of risk. Our methodology borrows basic concepts from portfolio valuation theory that were originally developed for the allocation of financial investments under uncertainty. In our case, we treat the model-based estimates of a pest invasion at individual geographical locations as analogous to a set of individual investment asset types that constitute a 'portfolio'. We then estimate the highest levels of pest invasion risk by finding the subset of geographical locations with the 'worst' combinations of a high likelihood of invasion and/or high uncertainty in the likelihood estimate. We illustrate the technique using a case study that applies a spatial pest transmission model to assess the likelihood that Canadian municipalities will receive invasive forest insects with commercial freight transported via trucks. The approach provides a viable strategy for dealing with the typical lack of knowledge about the behaviour of new invasive species and generally high uncertainty in model-based forecasts of ecological invasions.

Both warming treatments increased leaf N concentrations under ambient CO2 concentrations, but did not significantly alter leaf N concentrations under elevated CO2 concentrations. Nitrogen resorption from leaves was decreased under elevated CO2 conditions as well as by more frequent clipping. Fine root N concentrations decreased strongly with increasing soil depth and were further decreased at the 10-60 cm soil depths by elevated CO2 concentrations. The interaction between the CO2 and warming treatments showed that leaf N concentration was affected in a non-additive manner. Changes in leaf C : N ratios were driven by changes in N concentration.

The model was designed to calculate the population index or relative population using hourly weather data as influenced by developmental rate, high and low temperature mortalities and wet soil moisture mortality. Each module contains biological parameters derived from controlled experiments. The hourly weather data used for the model inputs were obtained from the National Center of Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) at a 38 km spatial resolution. A combination of spatial and site-specific temporal data was used to validate the GPFS models. The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), was selected as a case study for this research because it is climatically driven and a major pest of fruit production. Results from the GPFS model were compared with field B. dorsalis survey data in three locations: 1) Bangalore, India; 2) Hawaii, USA; and 3) Wuhan, China. The GPFS captured the initial outbreaks and major population peaks of B. dorsalis reasonably well, although agreement varied between sites. An index of agreement test indicated that GPFS model simulations matched with field B. dorsalis observation data with a range between 0.50 and 0.94 (1.0 as a perfect match). Of the three locations, Wuhan showed the highest match between the observed and simulated B. dorsalis populations, with indices of agreement of 0.85. The site-specific temporal comparisons implied that the GPFS model is informative for prediction of relative abundance. Spatial results from the GPFS model were also compared with 161 published observations of B. dorsalis distribution, mostly from East Asia. Since parameters for pupal overwintering and survival were unknown from the literature, these were inferred from the distribution data. The study showed that GPFS has promise for estimating suitable areas for B. dorsalis establishment and potentially other non-indigenous pests. It is concluded that calibrating prediction models with both spatial and site-specific temporal data may provide more robust and reliable results than validations with either data set alone.",,,,,,USDA-APHIS-PPQ Pest Detection program,"We appreciate ArcGIS technical support from Yu Takeuchi and David Christie at the Center of Integrated Pest Management in North Carolina State University.

Reproduction and survival are two of the most important demographic factors that play a major role in changing population abundances of pest species over time and space, solid understanding of which is a useful input to forecast future population changes for proactive management. Aims. We investigated the effects of rainfall, crop-development stage and density of stone bunds on reproductive patterns, and the effects of stone-bund density and sex on survival probabilities of two widespread rodent species (Mastomys awashensis and Arvicanthis dembeensis) in Ethiopian highlands. Methods. Rodent population dynamics were monitored from April 2007 to February 2011, using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) technique in four 60 x 60 m permanent square grids for four consecutive cropping seasons. Two of the grids represented fields with low stone-bund density (LSBD, similar to 15m apart) and the other two represented fields with high stone-bund density (HSBD, similar to 10m apart). Key results. Reproduction was seasonal, commencing during the wet season following the rain and continuing through the early dry season. We found an increase in the abundance of reproductively active female individuals of both species towards the milky and fruiting crop stages and around harvest period. We found no strong difference in survival probability between the two rodent species with variation in stone-bund density and sex. Conclusion. Stone bunds play a minor role in the reproduction and survival of the rodent species at the observed abundances. Implications. In terms of pest management, the high local survival rates estimated for both rodent species matter more than survival differences owing to variations in stone-bund density and sex.",,,,"Leirs, Herwig/B-8197-2008","Leirs, Herwig/0000-0002-7612-5024; Bauer, Hans/0000-0001-5031-5842","Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR-OUS), Belgium","We are grateful to the Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR-OUS), Belgium, for funding the research.

These mandates target possible adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the degree to which climate change is actively being considered in agency planning and management decisions is largely unknown. We explored the usefulness of climate change science for federal resource managers, focusing on the efficacy of potential adaptation strategies and barriers limiting the use of climate change science in adaptation efforts. Our study was conducted in the northern Rocky Mountains region of the western United States, where we interacted with 77 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management personnel through surveys, semistructured interviews, and four collaborative workshops at locations across Idaho and Montana. We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate managers' perceptions about adapting to and mitigating for climate change. Although resource managers incorporate general language about climate change in regional and landscape-level planning documents, they are currently not planning on-the-ground adaptation or mitigation projects. However, managers felt that their organizations were most likely to adapt to climate change through use of existing management strategies that are already widely implemented for other non climate-related management goals. These existing strategies, (e.g., thinning and prescribed burning) are perceived as more feasible than new climate-specific methods (e.g., assisted migration) because they already have public and agency support, accomplish multiple goals, and require less anticipation of the future timing and probability of climate change impacts. Participants reported that the most common barriers to using climate change information included a lack of management-relevant climate change science, inconsistent agency guidance, and insufficient time and resources to access, interpret, and apply current climate science information to management plans.",,,,"Tinkham, Wade/AAJ-2421-2020","Klos, P.

These changes trigger land-atmosphere feedbacks through altered energy partitioning in response to changes in albedo and surface water fluxes. Local-scale changes in the Arctic and boreal zones may propagate to affect large-scale climatic features. In this study, MODIS land surface data are used with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF V3.5.1) and Noah land surface model (LSM), in a series of experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the overlying atmosphere to perturbations in the structural vegetation in the northern European boreal ecosystem. Emphasis is placed on surface energy partitioning and near-surface atmospheric variables, and their response to observed and anticipated land cover changes. We find that perturbations simulating northward migration of evergreen needleleaf forest into tundra regions cause an increase in latent rather than sensible heat fluxes during the summer season. Shrub expansion in tundra areas has only small effects on surface fluxes. Perturbations simulating the northward migration of mixed forest across the present southern border of the boreal forest, have largely opposite effects on the summer latent heat flux, i.e., they lead to a decrease and act to moderate the overall mean regional effects of structural vegetation changes on the near-surface atmosphere.",,,,"; Stordal, Frode/R-6672-2017","Tallaksen, Lena M/0000-0002-8480-7842; Stordal, Frode/0000-0002-5190-6473",,,,,8,9,1,22,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2015,12,10,,,,,3071,3087,,10.5194/bg-12-3071-2015,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000356179300017,,,,,

The results suggest that the dynamic emission model is most sensitive to emissions from animal manure, in particular how animal manure and its application on fields is connected to national regulations. To incorporate the national regulations, we obtained activity information on agricultural operations at the sub-national level for Poland, information about infrastructure on storages and current regulations on manure practice from Polish authorities. The information was implemented in the existing emission model and was connected directly with calculations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The model was used to calculate four emission scenarios with high spatial (5 km x 5 km) and temporal resolution (3 h) for the entire year 2010. In the four scenarios, we have compared a constant emission approach (FLAT), scenario (1) against (2) a dynamic approach based on the Europe- wide default settings (Skjoth et al., 2011, scenario DEFAULT); (3) a dynamic approach that takes into account Polish practice and less regulation compared to Denmark (POLREGUL); (4) a scenario that focuses on emissions from agricultural buildings (NOFERT). The ammonia emission was implemented into the chemical transport model FRAME (Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange) and modelled ammonia concentrations were compared with measurements. The results for an agricultural area suggest that the default setting in the dynamic model is an improvement compared to a non-dynamical emission profile. The results also show that further improvements can be obtained at a national scale by replacing the default information on manure practice with information that is connected with local practice and national regulations. Implementing a dynamical approach for simulation of ammonia emission is a reliable but challenging objective for CTM models that continue to use fixed emission profiles.",,,,,"Skjoth, Carsten Ambelas/0000-0001-5992-9568; Kryza, Maciej/0000-0003-0873-7560; Werner, Malgorzata/0000-0003-2412-959X","Polish National Science Centre [UMO-2013/09/B/ST10/00594, UMO-2011/03/B/ST10/06226]",The study received support from the Polish National Science Centre through projects no.

In a 1994 burn, average forage production increased slightly (5%) between 2007 and 2013; however, the proportional removal across all sites declined significantly (10%). This suggests that moose are not utilizing the burn as much as they have in the past and that, as the burn has aged, the apparent habitat quality has declined. Areas with a greater proportion of accessible burned area supported both high numbers of hunters and harvested moose. Our results suggest that evaluating ecological variables in conjunction with social variables can provide managers with information to forecast management scenarios. We recommend that wildlife managers monitor fast variables frequently, e.g., annually, to adapt and keep their management responsive as resources fluctuate; whereas slower variables, which require less frequent monitoring, should be actively incorporated into long-term management strategies. Climate-driven increases in wildfire extent and severity and economically driven demographic changes are likely to increase both moose density and hunting pressure.

Understanding range shifts and changes in richness gradients under climate change is crucial for conservation. The Tibetan Plateau, home to wild yak, chiru, and kiang, contains a biome with many endemic ungulates. It is highly sensitive to climate change and a region that merits particular attention with regard to the impacts of global climate change on its biomes. Maximum entropy approaches were used to estimate current and future potential distributions, in response to climate change, for 22 ungulate species. We used three general circulation (MK3, HADCM3, MIROC3_2-MED) and three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B, A2) to derive estimated future measurements of 14 environmental variables over three time periods (2020, 2050, 2080), and then modeled species distributions using these predicted environmental measurements for each time period under two dispersal hypotheses (full and zero, respectively). This resulted in a total of 6160 prediction models. We found that these ungulates, on average, may lose 30-50% of their distributional areas, depending on the dispersal scenarios. In addition, 55-68% of the ungulate species were predicted to become locally endangered under the different dispersal assumptions, 23-32% to become locally critically endangered, and 4-7 endemic species to become globally endangered. Furthermore, ungulate species ranges may experience average poleward shifts of; 300 km. We also predict west-to-east reductions in species richness: southeastern mountainous areas currently have the highest species richness, but are predicted to face the greatest diversity losses, whereas the northern areas are predicted to see increasing numbers of ungulate species in the 21st century. Our study indicates much more severe range reductions of ungulates on the Tibetan Plateau than those anticipated elsewhere in the world, and species richness patterns will change dramatically with climate change. For conservation, we suggest (1) securing existing protected areas, and (2) establishing new nature reserves to counterbalance climate change impacts.",,,,"Jiang, Zhigang/E-4598-2014","Jiang, Zhigang/0000-0003-2154-8588","Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2008BAC39B04]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30670267, 30430120]; Forestry Department of Qinghai Province; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-Z-4]; Nature Conservancy","This study was supported by the Science and Technology Supporting Project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2008BAC39B04), National Nature Science Foundation of China (30670267, 30430120), the raptor survey project of the Forestry Department of Qinghai Province, the Key Program of Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-EW-Z-4), and The Nature Conservancy.

Focusing on actuarial senescence (i.e., the decline of survival probabilities at old ages), we use species-specific demographic information to project the extinction risk of wild populations of 58 species of mammals, accounting (or not) for senescence. Our projections reveal potential negative effects of aging on population viability, with an average decrease of 27% of the time to extinction and a potential deterioration of the population-level projected conservation status in 10% of the species. Senescence is associated with particularly strong increases of the extinction risk in species with low mortality rates and long intervals between litters, independently of their place in the phylogeny, indicating that the pace of life history can be used to forecast the detrimental effects of aging on the viability of species. The aim of the various existing systems of classification of threatened species is to set conservation priorities based on assessments of extinction risk. Our results indicate that the quantitative effects of senescence on extinction are highly heterogeneous, which can affect the ranking of species and populations when setting conservation priorities. In mammals, based on life history traits of a few species, generic patterns of senescence can be incorporated into projection population models to minimize these biases in viability assessments.",,,,"Teplitsky, Celine/H-3621-2019; Sarrazin, Francois/AAB-4227-2019; Sarrazin, Francois/B-7593-2013","Teplitsky, Celine/0000-0001-9458-709X; Sarrazin, Francois/0000-0001-5901-4819; Sarrazin, Francois/0000-0001-5901-4819; Pavard, Samuel/0000-0002-6803-8123",CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),S.

Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide, with a corresponding loss of live coral cover resulting in a loss of architectural complexity. Understanding the dynamics of the reef architecture is therefore important to envision the ability of corals to maintain functional habitats in an era of climate change. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of reef topographical complexity for contemporary Caribbean reefs. The model describes the dynamics of corals and other benthic taxa under climate-driven disturbances (hurricanes and coral bleaching). Corals have a simplified shape with explicit diameter and height, allowing species-specific calculation of their colony surface and volume. Growth and the mechanical (hurricanes) and biological erosion (parrotfish) of carbonate skeletons are important in driving the pace of extension/reduction in the upper reef surface, the net outcome being quantified by a simple surface roughness index (reef rugosity). The model accurately simulated the decadal changes of coral cover observed in Cozumel (Mexico) between 1984 and 2008, and provided a realistic hindcast of coral colony-scale (1-10m) changing rugosity over the same period. We then projected future changes of Caribbean reef rugosity in response to global warming. Under severe and frequent thermal stress, the model predicted a dramatic loss of rugosity over the next two or three decades. Critically, reefs with managed parrotfish populations were able to delay the general loss of architectural complexity, as the benefits of grazing in maintaining living coral outweighed the bioerosion of dead coral skeletons. Overall, this model provides the first explicit projections of reef rugosity in a warming climate, and highlights the need of combining local (protecting and restoring high grazing) to global (mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions) interventions for the persistence of functional reef habitats.",,,,"Alvarez-Filip, Lorenzo/C-9552-2011; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Bozec, Yves-Marie/J-7168-2013","Alvarez-Filip, Lorenzo/0000-0002-5726-7238; Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Bozec, Yves-Marie/0000-0002-7190-5187",European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [244161]; NERC grantNERC Natural Environment Research Council; ARC Laureate FellowshipAustralian Research Council,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union 7th Framework programme (P7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. 244161 (FORCE project), a NERC grant and ARC Laureate Fellowship to PJM.

Within Flanders (Belgium), which is characterized by a highly sprawled urban network and a sealed surface density much higher than in many other European metropolitan regions, there is a strong need for more accurate high-resolution forecasting of soil sealing densities. This study attempts to meet this need by developing a spatial explanatory model for soil sealing density that is applicable at the regional scale and that can be applied in combination with the Flanders cellular automata land-use change model for evaluating the impact of future land-use scenarios on soil sealing. In the modelling, neighbourhood characteristics such as land-use composition and positioning with respect to the urban network and its major transport axes are considered as attraction/repulsion factors for soil sealing. Global multiple regression and regression tree models are compared with a simple average model. The regression models yield clear improvements in overall estimation accuracy and a favourable distribution of the remaining error. Applying a two-rule partitioning model on a future land- use map, produced by the Flanders land-use change model, shows an increase of 23.6% and 44.6% of sealed surface cover within residential/mixed areas in the study area by 2030 and 2050, respectively.

Trait variation in time and among populations may increase species resilience and ultimately reduce the risk of extinction. However, patterns of among-population variation in critical recruitment traits remain poorly known and are often disregarded when considering extinction risk under future climates. LocationGlobal. MethodsIn this paper we review and synthesize current knowledge about among-population variation in physiological and morphological traits related to plant recruitment. We outline the consequences of that variation for species persistence under climate change, and discuss the implications for conservation, management and restoration. ResultsThe evaluated studies provide compelling evidence that among-population variation in traits underpinning seedling emergence, growth and establishment is widespread. Contrary to expectations, environmental gradients do not appear to be reliable predictors of variation among populations and responses are often individualistic. Likewise, well-established cross-species patterns are not consistently reflected among populations within a species. As the pattern of this variation is unpredictable, we cannot make simple generalizations about how this variation is allocated across geographic ranges or the extent of environmental versus fixed genetic differences. Nor do these patterns clearly elucidate the potential for this variation to mitigate negative effects of climate change. Main conclusionsIf we ignore among-population variation in seed traits, or assume it will follow simple environmental clines, we do so at our own peril. The consequences of such an approach are likely to include biased forecasts of future range dynamics, hindering identification of the genetic material most appropriate for conservation, restoration and management. Further research that integrates ecology and emerging evolutionary genetic techniques to identify the distribution of seed traits within foundation species and the mechanisms driving them is urgently required to guide the management and maintenance of systems in the face of rapidly changing climates.",,,,"Nicotra, Adrienne B/C-1361-2009","Nicotra, Adrienne B/0000-0001-6578-369X","Australian National University doctoral scholarship; Department of Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia","A.C. received support from an Australian National University doctoral scholarship and financial support from the Department of Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia.

Tree species can experience particularly long time lags in their migration response, resulting in altered forest composition and potentially delaying the migration of other obligate species. Here we review potential causes of these time lags and develop a conceptual framework for understanding how migration timing affects the observed rate of change. LocationGlobal forest ecosystems. MethodsWe synthesize evidence from present-day tree species migrations to determine how different migration constraints can delay tree species range shifts. ResultsThe rate of present-day tree migrations is frequently slower than expected, and many factors may contribute to observed migration lags. Migration constraints can be overcome given the right combination of circumstances, resulting in episodic range shifts that create temporal variability in migration rates. Given projected increases in forest disturbances and extreme climatic events, episodic range shifts are likely. Main conclusionsRecent efforts to explain the slow rate of tree migration have primarily focused on dispersal limitation and niche-based constraints such as competition and other biotic interactions. We argue that these constraints cannot be fully understood without considering the temporal context of tree migration. Attempts to forecast and manage future distribution shifts must consequently consider how migration timing may affect observed patterns of change.",,,,"Rocca, Monique/N-4528-2013","Rocca, Monique/0000-0002-5298-1643",,,,,34,34,2,88,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

However, since the management is based on a target escapement strategy, and most capelin die after spawning, viewed in retrospect, there is hardly any possibility of checking whether the forecast underpinning the quota was actually realistic. The forecast using Captool for the period from 1 October up to capelin spawning time at 1 April relies on a forecast of cod abundance during this period. This estimate of cod abundance is, in turn, based on a cod assessment from the previous spring. By rerunning the Captool model, where the cod forecast is replaced with the actual amount of cod from the cod assessment model run later in time, we show that considerably smaller annual quotas would have been advised if the true amount of cod had been known when the capelin quota was set. We discuss this fact in light of the present knowledge about recruitment success of capelin during the period. Our conclusion is that either the acoustic stock size estimates of capelin have been consistently underestimating the true stock size, the predation model overestimates the natural mortality of capelin during winter, the minimum spawning stock size considered necessary to uphold normal recruitment (B-lim) built into the harvest control rule is higher than needed to secure good recruitment, or a combination of these.",,,,", Gjosater/V-7898-2019",", Gjosater/0000-0001-7694-6503",,,,,11,11,0,9,,,,1745-1000,1745-1019,,MAR BIOL RES,Mar.

In this study we explore these interactions in the exchange of water, heat and CO2 in a cropland-atmosphere system at the diurnal and local scale. To that end, we couple an atmospheric mixed-layer model (MXL) to two land-surface schemes developed from two different perspectives: while one land-surface scheme (A-g(s)) simulates vegetation from an atmospheric point of view, the other (GECROS) simulates vegetation from a carbon-storage point of view. We calculate surface fluxes of heat, moisture and carbon, as well as the resulting atmospheric state and boundary-layer dynamics, over a maize field in the Netherlands, on a day for which we have a rich set of observations available. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the role of upper-atmosphere conditions like subsidence in comparison to the role of surface forcings like soil moisture. We show that the atmospheric-oriented model (MXL-A-g(s)) outperforms the carbon storage-oriented model (MXL-GECROS) on this diurnal scale. We find this performance is partly due to the difference of scales at which the models were made to run. Most importantly, this performance strongly depends on the sensitivity of the modelled stomatal conductance to water stress, which is implemented differently in each model. This sensitivity also influences the magnitude of the surface fluxes of CO2, water and heat (surface control) and subsequently impacts the boundary-layer growth and entrainment fluxes (upper atmosphere control), which alter the atmospheric state. These findings suggest that observed CO2 mole fractions in the boundary layer can reflect strong influences of both the surface and upper-atmosphere conditions, and the interpretation of CO2 mole fraction variations depends on the assumed land-surface coupling. We illustrate this with a sensitivity analysis where high subsidence and soil moisture depletion, typical for periods of drought, have competing and opposite effects on the boundary-layer height h. The resulting net decrease in h induces a change of 12 ppm in the late-afternoon CO2 mole fraction. Also, the effect of such high subsidence and soil moisture depletion on the surface Bowen ratio are of the same magnitude. Thus, correctly including such two-way land-surface interactions on the diurnal scale can potentially improve our understanding and interpretation of observed variations in atmospheric CO2, as well as improve crop yield forecasts by better describing the water loss and carbon gain.",,,,"Peters, Wouter/B-8305-2008; Vila, Jordi/B-4538-2010","Peters, Wouter/0000-0001-8166-2070; Vila, Jordi/0000-0003-0342-9171; Jacobs, Cor/0000-0003-4079-9067; Combe, Marie/0000-0003-2623-8212; Ouwersloot, Huug/0000-0002-6327-6720",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research through VIDINetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [864.08.012]; China Exchange Program of the Dutch Royal Academy of Research (KNAW) [12CDP006],"This research was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research through VIDI grant no. 864.08.012 and by the China Exchange Program of the Dutch Royal Academy of Research (KNAW) through travel grant no. 12CDP006.

These data reveal at least six striking spikes in chlorophyll from October through December, at approximately 2-week intervals, that coincide with the development of the fall Wyrtki jets during the transition between the summer and winter monsoons. Concurrent meteorological and in situ physical measurements from the mooring reveal that the chlorophyll pulses are associated with the intensification of eastward winds at the surface and eastward currents in the mixed layer. These observations are inconsistent with upwelling dynamics as they occur in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, since eastward winds that force Wyrtki jet intensification should drive downwelling. The chlorophyll spikes could be explained by two alternative mechanisms: (1) turbulent entrainment of nutrients and/or chlorophyll from across the base of the mixed layer by wind stirring or Wyrtki jet-induced shear instability or (2) enhanced southward advection of high chlorophyll concentrations into the equatorial zone. The first mechanism is supported by the phasing and amplitude of the relationship between wind stress and chlorophyll, which suggests that the chlorophyll spikes are the result of turbulent entrainment driven by synoptic zonal wind events. The second mechanism is supported by the observation of eastward flows over the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, generating high chlorophyll to the north of the equator. Occasional southward advection can then produce the chlorophyll spikes that are observed in the mooring record. Wind-forced biweekly mixed Rossby gravity waves are a ubiquitous feature of the ocean circulation in this region, and we examine the possibility that they may play a role in chlorophyll variability. Statistical analyses and results from the OFAM3 (Ocean Forecasting Australia Model, version 3) eddy-resolving model provide support for both mechanisms. However, the model does not reproduce the observed spikes in chlorophyll. Climatological satellite chlorophyll data show that the elevated chlorophyll concentrations in this region are consistently observed year after year and so are reflective of recurring large-scale wind-and circulation-induced productivity enhancement in the central equatorial Indian Ocean.",,,,"matear, richard J/C-5133-2011; McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016; Phillips, Helen/I-3761-2013; Strutton, Peter/C-4466-2011","matear, richard J/0000-0002-3225-0800; McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805; Phillips, Helen/0000-0002-2941-7577; Strutton, Peter/0000-0002-2395-9471; Coles, Victoria/0000-0002-7247-0007",Australian Research Council's Future Fellow schemeAustralian Research Council; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System ScienceAustralian Research Council; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; CSIROCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); CSIRO Wealth from Oceans National Flagship; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,P.

In this study, recently proposed supervised classification techniques, tested by the machine-learning community, are applied to forecast the recruitment of seven fish species of North East Atlantic (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, horse mackerel, hake, blue whiting and albacore), using spawning, environmental and climatic data. In addition, the use of the probabilistic flexible naive Bayes classifier (FNBC) is proposed as modelling approach in order to reduce uncertainty for fisheries management purposes. Those improvements aim is to improve probability estimations of each possible outcome (low, medium and high recruitment) based in kernel density estimation, which is crucial for informed management decision making with high uncertainty. Finally, a comparison between goodness-of-fit and generalization power is provided, in order to assess the reliability of the final forecasting models. It is found that in most cases the proposed methodology provides useful information for management whereas the case of horse mackerel is an example of the limitations of the approach.

The southern Appalachian Mountains are the southern extent of the geographic range of native Salvelinus fontinalis and naturalized Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo trutta in eastern North America. We predicted distributions of these peripheral, headwater wild trout populations at a fine scale to serve as a planning and management tool for resource managers to maximize resistance and resilience of these populations in the face of anthropogenic stressors. We developed correlative logistic regression models to predict occurrence of brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout for every interconfluence stream reach in the study area. A streamnetwork was generated to capture a more consistent representation of headwater streams. Each of the final models had four significant metrics in common: stream order, fragmentation, precipitation, and land cover. Strahler stream order was found to be the most influential variable in two of the three final models and the second most influential variable in the other model. Greater than 70% presence accuracy was achieved for all three models. The underrepresentation of headwater streams in commonly used hydrography datasets is an important consideration that warrants close examination when forecasting headwater species distributions and range estimates. Additionally, it appears that a relative watershed position metric (e.g., stream order) is an important surrogate variable (even when elevation is included) for biotic interactions across the landscape in areas where headwater species distributions are influenced by topographical gradients.",,,,"Nelson, Stacy/W-4315-2019; DeRolph, Christopher/M-4535-2017","Nelson, Stacy/0000-0003-4681-7270; DeRolph, Christopher/0000-0002-8321-9539; Kwak, Thomas/0000-0002-0616-137X",Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Funds,This research was funded by Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Funds.,,,4,4,0,30,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Few studies, however, address changes likely to affect services from seminatural ecosystems. We analyzed ecosystem goods and services in natural and seminatural systems, specifically how they are expected to change as a result of projected climate change during the 21st century. We selected terrestrial and freshwater systems in northernmost Europe, where climate is anticipated to change more than the global average, and identified likely changes in ecosystem services and their societal consequences. We did this by assembling experts from ecology, social science, and cultural geography in workshops, and we also performed a literature review. Results show that most ecosystem services are affected by multiple factors, often acting in opposite directions. Out of 14 services considered, 8 are expected to increase or remain relatively unchanged in supply, and 6 are expected to decrease. Although we do not predict collapse or disappearance of any of the investigated services, the effects of climate change in conjunction with potential economical and societal changes may exceed the adaptive capacity of societies. This may result in societal reorganization and changes in ways that ecosystems are used.

From the first agricultural canals to the present day, water networks have transformed the territory, favouring the creation and development of human settlements, but also resulting in severe impacts. The complexity achieved by these networks and its environmental effects require the establishment of coordinated strategies between Land Use Planning and Water Resource Management, to generate sustainable land use scenarios. In this sense, threshold scenarios are proposed as a convenient tool to limit the uncertainty and determine the impacts of water infrastructures on the territory, helping with decision making and anticipating possible deviations from the plans' forecasts. In this paper a study on the coast of Granada (Spain) is presented. It shows the importance of including threshold scenarios in an integrated water resource management, as a tool that can be used in the strategic environmental assessment to evaluate territorial integration in water management.",,,,"Rodriguez-Rojas, M.I./AAB-2732-2019; Grindlay, Alejandro Luis/H-9815-2015","Rodriguez-Rojas, M.I./0000-0001-5187-5032; Grindlay, Alejandro Luis/0000-0001-5176-0550",,,,,1,1,0,0,,,,1743-3541,,978-1-84564-901-2; 978-1-84564-900-5,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

Although studies in grasslands have shown sensitivity of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) to both precipitation amount and event size, we lack equivalent knowledge for responses of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) and NPP. We conducted a 2-year experiment in three US Great Plains grasslands - the C-4-dominated shortgrass prairie (SGP; low ANPP) and tallgrass prairie (TGP; high ANPP), and the C-3-dominated northern mixed grass prairie (NMP; intermediate ANPP) - to test three predictions: (i) both ANPP and BNPP responses to increased precipitation amount would vary inversely with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and site productivity; (ii) increased numbers of extreme rainfall events during high-rainfall years would affect high and low MAP sites differently; and (iii) responses belowground would mirror those aboveground. We increased growing season precipitation by as much as 50% by augmenting natural rainfall via (i) many (11-13) small or (ii) fewer (3-5) large watering events, with the latter coinciding with naturally occurring large storms. Both ANPP and BNPP increased with water addition in the two C-4 grasslands, with greater ANPP sensitivity in TGP, but greater BNPP and NPP sensitivity in SGP. ANPP and BNPP did not respond to any rainfall manipulations in the C-3-dominated NMP. Consistent with previous studies, fewer larger (extreme) rainfall events increased ANPP relative to many small events in SGP, but event size had no effect in TGP. Neither system responded consistently above- and belowground to event size; consequently, total NPP was insensitive to event size. The diversity of responses observed in these three grassland types underscores the challenge of predicting responses relevant to C cycling to forecast changes in precipitation regimes even within relatively homogeneous biomes such as grasslands.",,,,"von Fischer, Joe/AAC-6977-2019; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008; Wilcox, Kevin/D-7281-2013","von Fischer, Joseph/0000-0001-5508-6073; Wilcox, Kevin/0000-0001-6829-1148",Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research program,"This research was supported by the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research program.

For Arctic breeding species in particular, following highly profitable food is important, so that they can replenish resources along the way and arrive in optimal body condition to start breeding early. We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic breeding geese on different flyways to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) were tracked with solar GPS/ARGOS PTTs from their wintering grounds to breeding sites in Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12). The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways was calculated as the correlation and slope between onsets of spring at consecutive stopovers. These values differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first, they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers, arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition, and at the breeding grounds, early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. Our results suggest that a chain of correlations between climatic conditions at subsequent stopovers enables geese to closely track the green wave. However, the birds' precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules. These might become non-optimal due to climate warming and preclude accurate timing of long-distance migrants in the future.",,,,"Bauer, Silke/C-3524-2008; Exo, Klaus-Michael/W-7664-2019; van der Jeugd, Henk/F-4891-2010; Bauer, Silke/M-9811-2019; Nolet, Bart A/C-1416-2008; van der Jeugd, Henk/S-3159-2019; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Bauer, Silke/0000-0002-0844-164X; Exo, Klaus-Michael/0000-0001-9140-1835; van der Jeugd, Henk/0000-0002-5332-9526; Bauer, Silke/0000-0002-0844-164X; Nolet, Bart A/0000-0002-7437-4879; van der Jeugd, Henk/0000-0002-5332-9526; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) Programme of the European Space Agency; SURF Foundation; Scottish Natural Heritage; Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Sustainable Development Fund; BBC and Heritage Lottery Fund Awards; Strategic Fund of the KNAW,"The GPS data of the Barents Sea flyway geese were provided by FlySafe (http://iap.esa.int/flysafe), a project initiated by the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) Programme of the European Space Agency.

The GEB is designed to determine 'baseline' activity data for reference levels. Unlike other models that forecast business-as-usual future deforestation, the GEB internally (1) characterizes 'forest' and 'deforestation' with minimal processing and ground-truthing and (2) identifies 'deforestation hotspots' using open-source spatial methods to estimate regional rates of deforestation. The GEB also characterizes forest degradation and identifies leakage belts. This paper compares the accuracy of GEB with GEOMOD, a popular land-change model used in the UNREDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Program. Using a case study of the Chinese tropics for comparison, GEB's projection is more accurate than GEOMOD's, as measured by Figure of Merit.

Here I review the research on plant-pollinator mismatch, assessing the potential for observational and experimental approaches to address particular aspects of the problem. Recent, primarily observational studies suggest that phenologies of co-occurring plants and pollinators tend to respond similarly to environmental cues, but that nevertheless, certain pairs of interacting species are showing independent shifts in phenology. Only in a few cases, however, have these independent shifts been shown to affect population vital rates (specifically, seed production by plants) but this largely reflects a lack of research. Compared to the few long-term studies of pollination in natural plant populations, experimental manipulations of phenology have yielded relatively optimistic conclusions about effects of phenological shifts on plant reproduction, and I discuss how issues of scale and frequency-dependence in pollinator behaviour affect the interpretation of these temporal transplant' experiments. Comparable research on the impacts of mismatch on pollinator populations is so far lacking, but both observational studies and focused experiments have the potential to improve our forecasts of pollinator responses to changing phenologies. Finally, while there is now evidence that plant-pollinator mismatch can affect seed production by plants, it is still unclear whether this phenological impact will be the primary way in which climate change affects plant-pollinator interactions. It would be useful to test the direct effects of changing climate on pollinator population persistence, and to compare the importance of phenological mismatch with other threats to pollination.",,,,"Forrest, Jessica/A-6290-2010","Forrest, Jessica/0000-0002-5273-9339",,,,,79,81,13,296,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2015,124,1,,,,,4,13,,10.1111/oik.01386,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000347052300002,,,,,

This material is further distributed across the Arctic by ocean currents and sea ice. The coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to changes related to recent climate change. We compiled a pan-Arctic review that looks into the changing Holocene sources, transport processes and sinks of terrigenous sediment in the Arctic Ocean. Existing palaeoceanographic studies demonstrate how climate warming and the disappearance of ice sheets during the early Holocene initiated eustatic sea-level rise that greatly modified the physiography of the Arctic Ocean. Sedimentation rates over the shelves and slopes were much greater during periods of rapid sea-level rise in the early and middle Holocene, as a result of the relative distance to the terrestrial sediment sources. However, estimates of suspended sediment delivery through major Arctic rivers do not indicate enhanced delivery during this time, which suggests enhanced rates of coastal erosion.

This problem is difficult due to differences in population responses among closely related taxa. Increased understanding of dynamic relationships between exogenous and endogenous factors will facilitate forecasting and suggest nodes in the life cycle of economically important species susceptible to intervention by managers. This study uses an information-theoretic approach to examine the contributions of weather and density to model population densities and growth rates of nine common grasshopper species from continental U. S. grassland over 25 years. In general, grass-feeding species and total grass-feeders as a functional group were most closely associated with weather during the year before hatching. Increased variability in prior growing season precipitation was associated with increased densities of Mermiria bivittata, Opeia obscura, Phoetaliotes nebrascensis, and the grass-feeding guild. Melanoplus sanguinipes densities tended to be smaller following warm fall seasons, while Amphitoruns coloradus declined during the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation or after warmer than average winters. Population growth rate dynamics of all grouped species combinations were best explained by models including variability in precipitation during the prior year growing season. Large-scale Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) patterns were also associated with growth rate dynamics of the mixed-feeding species group. Density showed a negative relationship with population growth rates of five species. This study indicates the importance of parental and diapause environmental conditions and the utility of incorporating long-term, readily obtained decadal weather indices for forecasting grasshopper densities and identifying critical years with regard to grasshopper management-at least to the degree that the past will continue to predict the future as global climates change.

In this sense, turbidity is shown as a key variable in water quality control because it is an integrative parameter. Consequently, the aim of this work is focused on this main parameter and how it is been influenced by other water quality parameters in order to simplify water quality controls since they are expensive and time consuming. Taking into account that support vector machines (SVMs) have been used in a wide range of biological problems with promising results, this paper proposes a practical new hybrid model for long-term turbidity values forecasting based on SVMs in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. Bearing this in mind, turbidity values have been predicted here by using the hybrid PSO-SVM-based model from the remaining measured water quality parameters (input variables) in the Nalon river basin (Northern Spain) with success. The agreement of the PSO-SVM-based model with experimental data confirmed the good performance of this model. Finally, the main conclusions of this study are exposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Due to high productivity rates comparable to those of the north seas, here the benthic organisms reach sizes or densities significantly higher than the same species observed in other Mediterranean localities and show wider periods of reproduction. Concerning the dynamics of zoanthids, there are very few studies about these Mediterranean species, and this research is the first on the abundance and reproduction of Epizoanthus arenaceus. The zoanthid from shallow waters of the NW Adriatic Sea has a maximum abundance of 25,000 polyps m(-2) (about 40 g C m(-2)). E. arenaceus shows a growth phase during winter and a regression period from summer to autumn coinciding with gametogenesis. During summer, the decreases in current intensity and prey concentration combined with the increase in the reproductive effort may cause shrinkage and fission/fragmentation of the colonies. On the contrary, the maturation and release of gametes are positively correlated with the temperature trend. A temporal and spatial separation of the production of male and female gametes was observed, leading us to hypothesize that temperature could affect sex determination. The comparison of patterns in abundance and reproduction at 3-4 m and 6-7 m shows that the shallower colonies seem to be more sensitive to extreme values of temperature. The NW sector of the Adriatic Sea, vulnerable to severe anthropogenic pressure and subject to frequent thermal anomalies, is particularly prone to the mortality episodes of benthic organisms. For these reasons, the study of the dynamics of invertebrates from this area is crucial to forecast the effects of environmental changes in the entire Mediterranean basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aimed to understand the growth dynamics of the region, to forecast its future expansion, and to provide a basis for regional management. We calibrated and validated a SLEUTH model with historical data derived from different sources, which comprised remotely sensed and strategic planning data records from 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2009. Three scenarios based on local regional ecological planning were designed to simulate the spatial pattern of urban growth in different conditions. The first scenario allowed urban expansion without any additional managed growth limitations and the continuation of the actual historical trend. The second scenario was limited based on environmental considerations and managed growth was assumed with moderate protection. The third scenario simulated managed growth with strict protection on wetland reserves and productive agricultural areas in the study area. We consider that the results of these models of growth in the study area obtained under different scenarios are of great potential use to city managers and stakeholders. We also suggest that scale sensitivity and spatial accuracy are among the factors that must be considered in practical applications.

While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections.

We worked with state agencies in the southeastern United States to identify high-priority amphibian species, to model the vulnerabilities of those species to regional climate change, and to identify long-term climatic refugia within the context of existing conservation lands. Directly interfacing with state natural resource experts ensured that 1) species prioritization schemes extend beyond political boundaries and 2) our models resulted in conservation-relevant applications. We used a correlative model to project midcentury distributions of suitable climate for priority species and to evaluate each species' vulnerability to climate change. Using spatially explicit projected climate distributions, we ranked existing protected areas relative to their ability to provide climatic refugia for priority species in 2050. We identified 21 species as regional high-priority species. Fifteen of the 21 species are forecast to lose more than 85% of their climatically suitable habitat. Regions in the Appalachian Mountains, the Florida Panhandle, and the north-central region of Alabama are projected to lose the most climatic habitat for priority amphibian species. We identified many existing protected areas as midcentury climatic refugia in the Appalachians; however, our projections indicated refugia in the Southeast Coastal Plain to be exceedingly scarce. Although the topographic relief present in the Appalachians appears to provide future conservation opportunities via climatic refugia, the Coastal Plain affords fewer such opportunities and conservation of amphibians in that region is likely to be more challenging. The approach outlined here could be applied across a broad range of taxa and regions.",,,,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through a Competitive State Wildlife Grant; Georgia Department of Natural Resources; Alabama Natural Heritage Program; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources; Mississippi Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks Department; North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences; North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission; South Carolina Department of Natural Resources; Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation; Tennessee Natural Heritage Program; Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency","This project was supported by funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through a Competitive State Wildlife Grant, and from Georgia Department of Natural Resources.

Post-release dispersal (i.e. the movements from the release site to the first breeding site) has recently been identified as another source of local translocation failure. In spite of their potential effects on conservation program outcomes, little is known about the quantitative effects of these two sources of translocation failure and their interactions with environmental factors and management designs. Based on long-term monitoring data of captive-bred North African houbara bustards Chlamydotis undulata undulata (hereafter, houbara) over large spatial scales, we investigated the relative effects of release (e.g. release group size, period of release), individual (e.g. sex and body condition) and meteorological (e.g. temperature and rainfall) conditions on post-release survival (n=957 individuals) and dispersal (n=436 individuals). We found that (i) rainfall and ambient air temperature had, respectively, a negative and a positive effect on houbara post-release dispersal distance; (ii) in interaction with the release period, harsh meteorological conditions had negative impact on the survival of houbara; (iii) density-dependent processes influenced the pattern of departure from the release site; and (iv) post-release dispersal distance was male-biased, as natal dispersal of wild birds (although the dispersal patterns and movements may be influenced by different processes in captive-bred and in wild birds).Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that post-release dispersal and mortality costs in translocated species may be mediated by meteorological factors, which in turn can be buffered by the release method. As the consequences of translocation programs on population dynamics depend primarily upon release costs and colonization process, we suggest that their potential interactions with meteorological conditions must be carefully addressed in future programs (i) through monitoring of short-term post-release mortality to understand its link with environmental conditions, (ii) by carefully choosing the season of release to minimize exposition of inexperienced individuals to harsh conditions and (iii) by generalizing the use of long-term weather forecast to adapt release effort and staggering releases over several years to buffer meteorological effects.

We estimated the distributions of endemic bird species based on a 12-yr avian inventory project in Taiwan, identified biodiversity hotspots of endemism on a regional scale based on predictions from the ensemble forecasting framework and frequency histogram approach, and assessed the efficiency of protected areas. The results indicated that the predicted endemism hotspots were mostly located in mid- and high-elevation areas along the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan. An observed endemism hotspot was defined as one in which at least five of Taiwan's 17 endemic bird species were present. This criterion was used because the 5% of the sampled grid squares that were the richest in endemic bird species all had 5 endemic bird species or more. Seventy to seventy-one percent of the observed biodiversity hotspots matched the predicted biodiversity hotspots. This outcome was obtained whether the richness biodiversity in a grid square was based on summed predicted probability or summed predicted richness. The majority of the protected areas for these Taiwanese endemic bird species were national parks, protecting 24.1% of the predicted hotspot areas, whereas nature reserves and wildlife refuges protected less than 7%. Most of the predicted endemism hotspots were not adequately protected. We conclude that the ensemble forecasting framework and the frequency histogram approach are useful for selecting critical habitats and biodiversity hotspots for endemic species and for appraising the efficiency of the protection status provided by governments.

Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.",,,,"Hickler, Thomas/AAE-8577-2019; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Normand, Signe/A-1561-2012; Higgins, Steven I/A-5138-2012","Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Normand, Signe/0000-0002-8782-4154; Higgins, Steven I/0000-0001-5695-9665; Pagel, Jorn/0000-0002-4817-1920","Danish Council for Independent Research\Natural SciencesDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [10-085056]; Aarhus Univ.; Aarhus Univ.

Although the need for a multifaceted view of diversity based on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions is now commonly recognized, there are no complete risk assessments concerning their expected changes. In this paper, we used a range of species distribution models in an ensemble-forecasting framework together with regional climate and land cover projections by 2080 to analyze the potential threat for more than 2500 plant species at high resolution (2.5 x 2.5 km) in the French Alps. We also decomposed taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity facets into alpha and beta components and analyzed their expected changes by 2080. Overall, plant species threats from climate and land cover changes in the French Alps were expected to vary depending on the species' preferred altitudinal vegetation zone, rarity, and conservation status. Indeed, rare species and species of conservation concern were the ones projected to experience less severe change, and also the ones being the most efficiently preserved by the current network of protected areas. Conversely, the three facets of plant diversity were also projected to experience drastic spatial re-shuffling by 2080. In general, the mean alpha-diversity of the three facets was projected to increase to the detriment of regional beta-diversity, although the latter was projected to remain high at the montane-alpine transition zones. Our results show that, due to a high-altitude distribution, the current protection network is efficient for rare species, and species predicted to migrate upward. Although our modeling framework may not capture all possible mechanisms of species range shifts, our work illustrates that a comprehensive risk assessment on an entire floristic region combined with functional and phylogenetic information can help delimitate future scenarios of biodiversity and better design its protection.",,,,"Roquet, Cristina/AAB-4031-2019; Chalmandrier, Loic/H-8123-2019; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Chalmandrier, Loic/H-7885-2015; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019","Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Roquet, Cristina/0000-0001-8748-3743",European Research Council under European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [281422]; ANR SCIONFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-PEXT-03]; Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural SciencesDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [10-085056]; Rhone-Alpes regionRegion Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes [CPER0713 CIRA]; France-Grille,"The research leading to this paper had received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community's Seven Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 Grant Agreement no. 281422 (TEEMBIO).

It has been hypothesized that trees with diffuse-porous xylem anatomy and early successional species may respond most to warming. Within species, northern populations may respond most due to the fact that growing seasons are relatively short. Species most sensitive to spring temperature may show little overall response to warming if reduced chilling in fall/winter offsets accelerated winter/spring development. Because current thermal models consider only highly aggregated variables, for example degree-days or chilling units (temperature sums for a season or year), they may not accurately represent warming effects. We show that assumptions contained in current thermal (degree-day) models are unrealistic for climate change analysis. Critical threshold parameters are not identifiable, and they do not actually have much to do with thresholds for development. Traditional models further overlook the discrete nature of observations, observation error and the continuous response of phenological development to temperature variation. An alternative continuous development model (CDM) that addresses these problems is applied to a large experimental warming study near northern and southern boundaries of 15 species in the eastern deciduous forest of the USA, in North Carolina and Massachusetts. Results provide a detailed time course of phenological development, including vernalization during winter and warming in spring, and challenge the basic assumptions of thermal models. Where traditional models find little evidence of a chilling effect (most are insignificant or have the wrong sign), the continuous development model finds evidence of chilling effects in most species. Contrary to the hypothesis that northern populations respond most, we find southern populations are most responsive. Because northern populations already have a compressed period for spring development, they may lack flexibility to further advance development. A stronger response in the southern range could allow residents to resist northward migration of immigrants as climate warms. If potential invaders fail to exploit a prolonged growing season to the same degree as residents, then there is a resident advantage. Hypothesized effects of warming for xylem anatomy and successional status are not supported by the 15 species in this study. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",,,,,"Salk, Carl/0000-0003-2833-8292",Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE),"The project was funded by the Department of Energy.

This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs. LocationEurope and contiguous USA. MethodsWe contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium. ResultsA large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions. Main conclusionsOur results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change.",,,,,,"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TechnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BPD/63195/2009, EXPL/AAG-GLO/2488/2013]","Many thanks go to all who provided us with species distribution data from their herbaria or databases, listed in Table S1.2 in Appendix S1, and particularly to the Atlas Florae Europaeae; to R.

Terrestrial biosphere models are important forecasting tools, but to improve our understanding of large-scale terrestrial ecosystem function, we need to consider data from a number of sources and scales. Today remote sensing is improving our ability to derive information on forest structure and composition at a variety of scales, but their uncertainties in deriving these products to predicted carbon fluxes have not been investigated. This study investigated how uncertainties in forest structure and composition initialized at a temperate North American forest using a state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere model affect predictions of carbon dynamics in the short and decadal time-frame. Uncertainties in net carbon predictions are compared to a +/- 20% uncertainty value estimated for the terrestrial sink component of the global carbon budget (Pan et al., 2011). For short-term simulations, a +/- 20% uncertainty in both forest structure and composition is enough to predict a net carbon flux variation of +/- 21.5% (+/- 0.077 kg C/m(2)/year) and 20.5% (+/- 0.092 kg C/m(2)/year) respectively. For medium-term (11-40 years) simulations, only a 50% uncertainty in the initial forest structure predicts a net carbon flux variation beyond the +/- 20% threshold, but uncertainties in net carbon flux variation beyond +/- 20% were predicted from a 5% change in initial composition after 25 years of simulation. Remote sensing-derived forest structure and composition using LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy were also initialized, with all short term simulated net carbon fluxes within the +/- 20% cutoff. These results indicate that an accurate and full description of forest structure and composition from remote sensing within a +/- 20% uncertainty can be adequate in producing improved forecasts of terrestrial ecosystems for the next few decades.

While many studies suggest that fishing increases population sensitivity to climate forcing, the effects of climate variability on the population response to fishing is relatively understudied. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a synthesis based on 20 Atlantic cod populations (11 in the Northeast and 9 in the Northwest Atlantic). These cod populations display considerable life-history variation and are exposed to different temperature regimes and differential harvest pressure throughout their broad geographical range. We hypothesized that the differences in life histories that result from the different temperature regimes determine the sensitivity of cod populations to fishing. Spatial correlations between life-history traits (growth, maturation, and natural mortality) and water temperatures confirmed that warmer temperatures lead to faster individual growth, earlier maturation, and higher natural mortality. Analysis of a population model revealed how temperature influences on life histories lead to differential population responses to fishing. We represented such population responses to fishing using a proxy for lifetime reproduction (fraction of unfished lifetime spawning biomass, FLSB). This index revealed that-all else being equal-populations in warmer regions in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean can sustain higher fishing rates than those in the cooler Northwest. Life history-mediated temperature effects on population dynamics provide a novel perspective on synergistic relationships between climate and fisheries.

The discovered thresholds suggest that hypereutrophic lakes may reach N-limitation at nitrate concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in a mesotrophic lake, and that cyanobacteria may grow at much lower water temperatures and within a much wider temperature range at phosphorus sufficiency in a hypereutrophic lake than under phosphorus deficiency in a stratified mesotrophic lake.

The combined effects of future CO2 and differing light on the growth of seagrass and their algal epiphytes were tested by maintaining juvenile seagrasses Amphibolis antarctica under three different CO2 concentrations representing ambient, moderate future and high future forecasts (i.e. 390, 650 vs. 900 A mu l l(-1)) and two light levels representing low and high PAR (i.e. 43 vs. 167 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Aboveground and belowground biomass, leaf growth, epiphyte cover, tissue chemistry and photosynthetic parameters of seagrasses were measured. At low light, there was a neutral to positive effect of elevated CO2 on seagrass biomass and growth; at high light, this effect of CO2 switched toward negative, as growth and biomass decreased at the highest CO2 level. These opposing responses to CO2 appeared to be closely linked to the overgrowth of seagrass by filamentous algal epiphytes when high light and CO2 were combined. Importantly, all seagrass plants maintained positive leaf growth throughout the experiment, indicating that growth was inhibited by some experimental conditions but not arrested entirely. Therefore, while greater light or elevated CO2 provided direct physiological benefits for seagrasses, such benefits were likely negated by overgrowth of epiphytic algae when greater light and CO2 were combined.

However, our ability to do so is hindered by the fact that interaction outcomes are notoriously variable in space and time (i.e. context-dependent) and we lack a predictive understanding of the factors that drive this context-dependence. Determining whether abiotic factors, in particular, predictably shift the outcome of species interactions is of critical importance for many contemporary problems, from forecasting climate change impacts to predicting the efficacy of weed biocontrol. In this essay, we highlight the context-dependent nature of interactions between plants and their pollinators and herbivores. We advocate for approaches that will identify whether particular abiotic factors predictably shift how strongly these interactions influence plant abundance and/or population growth. We review long-standing theory that describes how abiotic context should influence the selective impacts of pollinators and herbivores on plants and articulate why this theory requires modification to predict population-level effects. Finally, we propose several empirical approaches to address gaps in existing knowledge: (i) experiments across broad abiotic gradients to determine whether the outcome of interactions between pollinators or herbivores and plants varies consistently with changing abiotic conditions; (ii) experiments that manipulate the underlying environmental gradient to elucidate whether the abiotic factor that correlates with interaction outcome is causal; and (iii) seed addition studies to explore how strongly seedling recruitment correlates with seed input (as affected by pollen limitation or herbivory) and to quantify how the strength of the seed-to-seedling linkage is influenced by the underlying abiotic gradient.Synthesis. Our understanding of the underlying drivers of context-dependent plant-animal interactions is currently not well developed. Progress in this area is essential to better predict when and where species interactions will alter the responses of plant populations to environmental changes as well as to develop more robust theory. Experiments aimed at explicitly exploring the role of abiotic factors in mediating the population-level impact of pollen limitation and herbivory could determine the extent to which variation in the abiotic environment predictably shifts the outcome of these interactions.",,,,,"Angert, Amy/0000-0003-3082-0133",,,,,52,52,6,157,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Though statistical climatic envelope models are frequently used to project future scenarios for species distributions under climate change, these models are rarely tested using empirical data. We used long-term data on bird distributions and abundance covering five states in the western US and in the Canadian province of British Columbia to test the capacity of statistical models to predict temporal changes in bird populations over a 32-year period. Using boosted regression trees, we built presence-absence and abundance models that related the presence and abundance of 132 bird species to spatial variation in climatic conditions. Presence/absence models built using 1970-1974 data forecast the distributions of the majority of species in the later time period, 1998-2002 (mean AUC=0.79 +/- 0.01). Hindcast models performed equivalently (mean AUC=0.82 +/- 0.01). Correlations between observed and predicted abundances were also statistically significant for most species (forecast mean Spearmans =0.34 +/- 0.02, hindcast=0.39 +/- 0.02). The most stringent test is to test predicted changes in geographic patterns through time. Observed changes in abundance patterns were significantly positively correlated with those predicted for 59% of species (mean Spearmans =0.28 +/- 0.02, across all species). Three precipitation variables (for the wettest month, breeding season, and driest month) and minimum temperature of the coldest month were the most important predictors of bird distributions and abundances in this region, and hence of abundance changes through time. Our results suggest that models describing associations between climatic variables and abundance patterns can predict changes through time for some species, and that changes in precipitation and winter temperature appear to have already driven shifts in the geographic patterns of abundance of bird populations in western North America.",,,,"Gutierrez Illan, Javier/A-3756-2009; Thomas, Chris/A-1460-2014; Betts, Matthew/Q-2978-2019; Thomas, Chris/A-1894-2012","Gutierrez Illan, Javier/0000-0002-3815-0536; Thomas, Chris/0000-0003-2822-1334; Thomas, Chris/0000-0003-2822-1334","Oregon State University; University of York; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-ARC 0941748, NSF 0823380]; MEC/Fulbright (Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, Spain) post-doctoral fellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of AustraliaGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [0257/BOS]; United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey [G11AC20255]","We thank Francisco J Gutierrez in memoriam for his constant and invaluable support to JGI.

This limits predictions to qualitative assessments or simplistic rules of thumb in data-poor regions, making management of the relevant systems difficult. We demonstrate a method for developing quantitative predictions of ecological response in data-poor ecosystems based on a space-for-time substitution, using distant, well-studied systems across an inherent climatic gradient to predict ecological response. Changes in biophysical data across the spatial gradient are used to generate quantitative hypotheses of temporal ecological responses that are then tested in a target region. Transferability of predictions among distant locations, the novel outcome of this method, is demonstrated via simple quantitative relationships that identify direct and indirect impacts of climate change on physical, chemical and ecological variables using commonly available data sources. Based on a limited subset of data, these relationships were demonstrably plausible in similar yet distant (>2000km) ecosystems. Quantitative forecasts of ecological change based on climate-ecosystem relationships from distant regions provides a basis for research planning and informed management decisions, especially in the many ecosystems for which there are few data. This application of gradient studies across domains - to investigate ecological response to climate change - allows for the quantification of effects on potentially numerous, interacting and complex ecosystem components and how they may vary, especially over long time periods (e.g. decades). These quantitative and integrated long-term predictions will be of significant value to natural resource practitioners attempting to manage data-poor ecosystems to prevent or limit the loss of ecological value. The method is likely to be applicable to many ecosystem types, providing a robust scientific basis for estimating likely impacts of future climate change in ecosystems where no such method currently exists.",,,,"Lester, Rebecca/H-3907-2011; Brown, Stuart/AAC-7472-2020","Lester, Rebecca/0000-0003-2682-6495; Brown, Stuart/0000-0002-0669-1418; Close, Paul/0000-0002-7323-0304",Deakin University,"We thank the Glenelg-Hopkins Catchment Management Authority, Tracy Calvert and Andrew Maughan (Western Australian Department of Water), and David Tunbridge (University of Western Australia) for providing data and knowledge.

We examined how intraspecific variation in thermal niches and phenotypic plasticity will affect species distributions in a warming climate. We first developed a conceptual model linking plasticity and niche breadth, providing five alternative intraspecific scenarios that are consistent with existing literature. Secondly, we used ecological niche-modeling techniques to quantify the impact of each intraspecific scenario on the distribution of a virtual species across a geographically realistic setting. Finally, we performed an analogous modeling exercise using real data on the climatic niches of different tree provenances. We show that when population differentiation is accounted for and dispersal is restricted, forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are even more pessimistic than those using the conventional assumption of homogeneously high plasticity across a species' range. Suitable population-level data are not available for most species so identifying general patterns of population differentiation could fill this gap.

Over the last 30 years spatial ecology has developed as an integrative, multidisciplinary science that has improved our understanding of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that accelerating climate change - the effective manipulation of time by humans - has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to understand and predict ecological dynamics in non-stationary environments, while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many concepts, models and approaches. However, similarities between space and time, especially related issues of scaling, provide an outline for improving ecological models and forecasting of temporal dynamics, while the unique attributes of time, particularly its emphasis on events and its singular direction, highlight where new approaches are needed. We emphasise how a renewed, interdisciplinary focus on time would coalesce related concepts, help develop new theories and methods and guide further data collection. The next challenge will be to unite predictive frameworks from spatial and temporal ecology to build robust forecasts of when and where environmental change will pose the largest threats to species and ecosystems, as well as identifying the best opportunities for conservation.",,,,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012","McLauchlan, Kendra/0000-0002-6612-1097; Wolkovich, Elizabeth M/0000-0001-7653-893X",NSERC CREATE training program in biodiversity research,"We thank D.

These shifts have received increasing attention in the ecological literature during the last two decades due to their global extent and their impacts on ecosystem functioning. This Special Feature includes a series of contributions on key topics within the study of grass-woodland transitions, including three articles addressing the drivers of these vegetation shifts and another three evaluating their ecological consequences. These articles, which include reviews, modelling and empirical studies, highlight the multiplicity of approaches and spatial scales being currently used when studying grass-woodland transitions. The first articles focus on the role of fire in driving the dynamics of mesic grasslands in the USA, on the effects of climate change on the transition zones between treeless vegetation, savanna and forest in tropical and subtropical Americas and on the role of the internal structure of vegetation as a determinant of grassland-woodland transitions. The articles devoted to exploring the consequences include a modelling study on the ecohydrological consequences of shrub removal in western North America and an empirical study aiming at understanding how abiotic and biotic attributes influence above-ground net productivity across Patagonian grasslands and shrublands, as well as a review of the consequences of brush management on the provision of ecosystem services.Synthesis. Identifying the best actions to avoid or take advantage of grass-woodland transitions requires a mechanistic understanding of both the drivers of these shifts and their ecological consequences. The collection of reviews, empirical and modelling studies included in this Special Feature contributes to forecasting how ongoing global change will affect grass-woodland transitions and their consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services from drylands, which account for a large fraction of Earth's surface.",,,,"Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008","Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856; Sala, Osvaldo/0000-0003-0142-9450",,,,,28,30,6,157,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

This study quantitatively estimates the change in lake surface area since the 1970s and investigates how this change can affect local and regional near-surface air temperatures during the summer. LANDSAT satellite imagery shows more than 80% reduction in lake surface area since the 1970s. Simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model show that this change in the lake surface can lead to a statistically significant warming of more than 6 degrees C in 2 m air temperatures over the dry lake bed and a significant warming signal of up to 1 degrees C covering an area up to 200 km around the original lake boundary, especially to the south. Observations in this region are sparse but still warming trends consistent with the simulations are seen in 2 m air temperatures from the Global Historical Climatology Network dataset. Atmospheric reanalysis and land cover data suggest that large-scale climate variability and land use change in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya basins contribute to the regional warming trends. Improvements in data and modeling capability are required to study the effects on diurnal and seasonal temperature cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, they are necessarily abstractions of natural systems, making predictive validation imperative. Models, which make predictions about binary outcomes (e.g. Species distribution models, population viability analysis, disease/invasion models), are widespread in the ecological literature. When supporting probability-based management decisions, these predictions need to be assessed with respect to the degree to which predicted probabilities agree with future outcomes. Many predictive models are not validated using external data and are often only assessed in terms of their ability to discriminate between outcomes rather than the degree to which they predicted the correct probabilities. We develop a novel Validation Metric Applied to Probabilistic Predictions (VMAPP), which provides a goodness-of-fit test of calibration for probabilistic prediction models using binary data (e.g. presences and absences in models of species distributions). We analyse the theoretic properties of this test and compare its performance against existing methods, and apply it to a published model in invasion biology, which forecasts the establishment probability of the zooplanktivorous spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus). We selected 102 additional sites to sample four years after the training data were collected and use this independently collected data to assess predictive reliability using VMAPP. Theoretic simulation analysis shows that VMAPP outperforms existing metrics (Cox's regression technique and Hosmer & Lemeshow's (2) test) in terms of statistical power to identify model miscalibration. Further, we find that under realistic conditions where model parameters are estimated (and have associated uncertainty) that VMAPP is more robust, retaining the appropriate type-I error rates (5%) where previous metrics fail (17%). Application of VMAPP to a published invasion model using empirical validation data shows that in addition to having high discriminative power, the model's probabilistic predictions agree with the observed outcomes as measured by VMAPP. We argue that quantifying ecological predictions as probabilities with associated uncertainty provides the most useful information to support management decisions. Ecological predictions, while uncertain, should still be rigorously validated. Identifying the circumstances in which our predictions deviate from observation can further inform the next generation of the model, bringing prediction and reality ever closer. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X</doi",,,,,"Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865",Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network NSERC; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This research was funded in part by the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network NSERC grant and NSERC discovery grant to BL.

We applied the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator (Climate-FVS), a new version of a widely used forest management model, to compare alternative climate and management scenarios in a severely burned multispecies forest of Arizona, USA. The incorporation of seven combinations of General Circulation Models (GCM) and emissions scenarios altered long-term (100 years) predictions of future forest condition compared to a No Climate Change (NCC) scenario, which forecast a gradual increase to high levels of forest density and carbon stock. In contrast, emissions scenarios that included continued high greenhouse gas releases led to near-complete deforestation by 2111. GCM-emissions scenario combinations that were less severe reduced forest structure and carbon stock relative to NCC. Fuel reduction treatments that had been applied prior to the severe wildfire did have persistent effects, especially under NCC, but were overwhelmed by increasingly severe climate change. We tested six management strategies aimed at sustaining future forests: prescribed burning at 5, 10, or 20-year intervals, thinning 40% or 60% of stand basal area, and no treatment. Severe climate change led to deforestation under all management regimes, but important differences emerged under the moderate scenarios: treatments that included regular prescribed burning fostered low density, wildfire-resistant forests composed of the naturally dominant species, ponderosa pine. Non-fire treatments under moderate climate change were forecast to become dense and susceptible to severe wildfire, with a shift to dominance by sprouting species. Current U.S. forest management requires modeling of future scenarios but does not mandate consideration of climate change effects. However, this study showed substantial differences in model outputs depending on climate and management actions.

Although temperature is generally considered most important, other weather events such as frosts and precipitation events can also influence many species' phenology. Non-climatic variables such as photoperiod and site-specific habitat characteristics can also have important effects on phenology. Forecasting phenological shifts due to climate change requires understanding and quantifying how these multiple factors combine to affect phenology. However, current approaches to analyzing phenological data have a limited ability for quantifying multiple drivers simultaneously. Here, we use a novel statistical approach to estimate the combined effects of multiple variables, including local weather events, on the phenology of several taxa (a tree, an insect, and a fungus). We found that thermal forcing had a significant positive effect on each species, frost events delayed the phenology of the tree and butterfly, and precipitation had a positive effect on fungal fruiting. Using data from sites across latitudinal gradients, we found that these effects are remarkably consistent across sites once latitude and other site effects are accounted for. This consistency suggests an underlying biological response to these variables that is not commonly estimated using data from field observations. This approach's flexibility will be useful for forecasting ongoing phenological responses to changes in climate variability in addition to seasonal trends.",,,,"Diez, Jeffrey/AAD-5956-2019",,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0842465],"We thank the Japan Meteorological Agency for collecting and making available the phenological data used here.

Establishing a sustainable bioenergy industry requires considering the role of biological control in farm decision making. An important question is how biomass supply changes when farmers take into account agricultural pest biocontrol services. A spatially-explicit bioeconomic model of potential biomass supply that incorporates the effect of biological control on crop choice is employed using data from four Wisconsin counties. The results of the study show that integrating agricultural biocontrol into farmers' production technology generally results in biomass from crop residues being supplied more readily (at a lower relative price).

Environmental factors, such as mean site temperature and soil characteristics, play an important role in the occurrence of the disease. The objective of the present work was to model and forecast the effect of environment on the severity of alder Phytophthora outbreaks, and to determine whether recent climate change might explain the disease emergence. Two alder sites networks in NE and SW France were surveyed to assess the crown health of trees; the oomycete soil inoculum was also monitored in the NE network. The main factors explaining the temporal annual variation in alder crown decline or crown recovery were the mean previous winter and previous summer temperatures. Both low winter temperatures and high summer temperatures were unfavorable to the disease. Cold winters promoted tree recovery because of poor survival of the pathogen, while hot summer temperature limited the incidence of tree decline. An SIS model explaining the dynamics of the P. alni-induced alder decline was developed using the data of the NE site network and validated using the SW site network. This model was then used to simulate the frequency of declining alder over time with historical climate data. The last 40years' weather conditions have been generally favorable to the establishment of the disease, indicating that others factors may be implicated in its emergence. The model, however, showed that the climate of SW France was much more favorable for the disease than that of the Northeast, because it seldom limited the overwintering of the pathogen. Depending on the European area, climate change could either enhance or decrease the severity of the alder decline.",,,,"Marcais, Benoit/O-5049-2019; Husson, Claude/C-6113-2012","Marcais, Benoit/0000-0002-8107-644X; Husson, Claude/0000-0002-9148-9926; Aguayo, Jaime/0000-0002-7552-0655; ELEGBEDE, Chabi/0000-0002-5721-3870",ANR project EmerfundisFrench National Research Agency (ANR); EU project Ecolirimed; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' program (Lab of Excellence ARBRE)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01],"We thank the ANR project Emerfundis and the EU project Ecolirimed for financing the project.

The fundamental hypothesis of the present study was that the temperature variations due to global climate change may affect seriously the future distribution and abundance of P. solenopsis, which might further aggravate the crop yield losses. We employed a temperature-based phenology model of P. solenopsis in a geographic information system for mapping population growth potentials of P. solenopsis. The three risk indices viz., establishment risk index, generation index and activity index were computed using interpolated temperature data from worldclim database for current (2000) and future (2050) climatic conditions. The daily minimum and maximum temperature data from four selected weather stations in India were used for analysing within-year variation of pest population. A linear relationship was established between the activity indices and yield losses at various locations reported in literatures for predicting the future trend of yield loss due to climate change. The results revealed that, under current temperature conditions P. solenopsis can complete >4.0 generations per year on similar to 80% of the global cotton production areas. Economic losses are likely to occur in areas where at least 8.0 generations can develop in a year; under current climate similar to 40% areas fall under this category. The increased geographical suitability at higher latitudes in cotton production areas, additional 2.0 generations per year, and 4.0 fold increase of population abundance of P. solenopsis are expected in tropical and sub-tropical cotton areas of Brazil, South Africa, Pakistan and India due to predicted climate change. Analysis of within year population increase at various selected locations in India revealed that, P. solenopsis attained maximum potential population increase during the major cotton growing season (May-June to October-November). On the other hand, the innate ability of P. solenopsis population to increase reduced considerably during off season and cooler winter months. The increased pest activity of P. solenopsis due to climate change may intensify the losses in cotton yield, with forecasted losses in India to increase from existing losses of million US$ 1217.10 to future losses of million US$ 1764.85 by the year 2050.

Integrated assessment models are the main tools used to estimate the global economic benefits of policies that would address climate change, but these models typically include only a partial accounting and idiosyncratic treatment of ecosystem impacts. Here, we review several recent studies of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and show that the biodiversity value function in the FUND integrated assessment model is insensitive to predicted biodiversity loss, instead depending almost entirely on temperature changes per se. We use quantitative estimates of the influence of global warming on species extinction rates to re-calibrate the biodiversity loss function in FUND, and develop a new global biodiversity nonuse value function calibrated using results from two previous studies of people's willingness to pay to prevent the loss of tropical rainforests and to protect endangered species in the US. In contrast to the ecosystem damages function in FUND, our biodiversity value function depends on temperature only indirectly through its influence on biodiversity loss. Finally, we highlight areas where further research is needed for developing more comprehensive and reliable forecasts of ecosystem damages related to climate change.

To do so, we use a long-term phenological data set of 20 common butterfly species from 83 sites across the state of Ohio, USA, with sites that range from rural undeveloped areas to moderately sized cities. These sites span a latitudinal gradient in mean temperature of several degrees C, mimicking the range of projected global climate warming effects through the end of the century. Although shifts toward earlier phenology are typical of species' responses to either global climate change or urbanization, we found that their interaction delayed several Ohio butterfly species' first appearance and peak abundance phenology. Exploitative species exhibited smaller delays in first appearance and peak abundance phenology in areas that were urbanized and geographically warm.

Specifically, the net impact of temperature on community structure depends on the relative response of physiological energetic costs (metabolism) and energetic gains (ingestion of resources) that mediate the flow of energy throughout a food web. However, the relative temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates have rarely been measured for multiple species within an ecological assemblage and it is not known how, and to what extent, these relative scaling differences vary among species. To investigate the relative influence of these processes, I measured the temperature scaling of metabolic and ingestion rates for a suite of rocky intertidal species using a multiple regression experimental design. I compared oxygen consumption rates (as a proxy for metabolic rate) and ingestion rates by estimating the temperature scaling parameter of the universal temperature dependence (UTD) model, a theoretical model derived from first principles of biochemical kinetics and allometry. The results show that consumer metabolic rates (energetic costs) tend to be more sensitive to temperature than ingestion rates (energetic gains). Thus, as temperature increases, metabolic rates tend to increase faster relative to ingestion rates, causing the overall energetic efficiencies of these rocky intertidal invertebrates to decline. Metabolic and ingestion rates largely scaled in accordance with the UTD model; however, nonlinearity was evident in several cases, particularly at higher temperatures, in which alternative models were more appropriate. There are few studies where multiple rate dependencies are measured on multiple species from the same ecological community. These results indicate that there may be general patterns across species in the temperature scaling of biological rates, with important implications for forecasting temperature effects on ecological communities.",,,,,,"B.

Nowadays, there are several free web-based services that provide environmental information in several formats with map images being the most commonly used to present air quality and pollen forecasts. This format, despite being intuitive for humans, complicates the extraction and processing of the underlying data. Typical examples of this case are the chemical weather forecasts, which are usually encoded heatmaps (i.e. graphical representation of matrix data with colors), while the forecasted numerical pollutant concentrations are commonly unavailable. This work presents a model for the semi-automatic extraction of such information based on a template configuration tool, on methodologies for data reconstruction from images, as well as on text processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The aforementioned modules are integrated in a standalone framework, which is extensively evaluated by comparing data extracted from a variety of chemical weather heat maps against the real numerical values produced by chemical weather forecasting models.

Algae are important for wetland functioning, but relatively little is known about the structure of algal communities among boreal wetlands. We documented spatial and temporal variability of algal community dynamics and productivity during a growing season in 6 wetlands (1 rich and 1 poor fen, 1 tussock, and 3 riverine marshes) in interior Alaska. Algal biomass and productivity were greater in the poor fen and a riverine marsh than in all other wetlands. Water depth and nutrients were significant predictors of benthic algal biomass and productivity among wetlands and were greatest immediately after the spring thaw and decreased during the growing season. Water depth and nutrients (N and P) explained the most variability in algal community structure. Algal community structure differed among wetlands, and temporal variation in environmental conditions was a significant predictor of the relative abundance of algal genera in individual wetlands. N-2-fixing cyanobacteria increased in abundance with a seasonal decline in water depth and nutrient concentrations.

By reconnecting isolated fragments, habitat corridors should dampen the synergistic impacts of habitat and climate change on population viability. Choosing which fragments to reconnect is typically informed by past and current environmental conditions. However, habitat and climate are dynamic and change over time. Habitat suitability projections could inform fragment selection using current and future conditions, ensuring that corridors connect persistent fragments. We compare the efficacy of using current-day and future forecasts of breeding habitat to inform corridor placement under land cover and climate-change mitigation and no mitigation scenarios by evaluating their influence on subpopulation abundance, and connectivity and long-term metapopulation abundance. Our case study is the threatened orangutan metapopulation in Sabah. Location Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Methods Using coupled niche-population models that capture a metapopulation distribution and its major processes, we forecast the effect of current-day and future-informed habitat corridor implementations under two scenarios where (1) land cover and climate change continue unabated (no mitigation) and (2) local and international cooperation mitigates their synergistic impact (mitigation). Results We show that Future-informed corridor placement maximizes longterm metapopulation abundance when human-driven land cover and climate change alter the spatio-temporal composition of suitable habitat. By contrast, there is no apparent benefit in using future forecasts of breeding habitat to inform corridor placement if conditions remain comparatively stable. For the Sabah orangutan under unabated land cover and climate change, habitat corridors should connect current-day populated eastern habitat fragments with vacant fragments in the state's west. Main conclusions The efficacy of habitat corridors can be improved by using habitat-suitability model projections to inform corridor placement in rapidly changing environments, even for long-lived, low-fecundity, philopatric species such as orangutan.",,,,"Gregory, Stephen D/A-1471-2010; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013","Gregory, Stephen D/0000-0002-8230-0191; Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Fordham, Damien A/0000-0003-2137-5592","Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council [DP1096427, FT100100200, FS110200051]","We thank the Economic Planning Unit for permission to conduct research in Sabah, the late Datuk Patrick Andau and the SFD, SWD and KOCP staff.

We review key cases of these abrupt fire regime changes at different spatial and temporal scales, including those directly driven (i) by fauna, (ii) by invasive plant species, and (iii) by socio-economic and policy changes. All these drivers might generate non-linear effects of landscape changes in fuel structure; that is, they generate fuel changes that can cross thresholds of landscape continuity, and thus drastically change fire activity.

We suggest that this paradigm might be obscured by species movement patterns. To explore this we used contrasting kangaroo (family Macropodidae) case studies: two species with relatively small, stable home ranges (Macropus giganteus and M. robustus) and three species with more extensive, adaptive ranging behaviour (M. antilopinus, M. fuliginosus and M. rufus). We predicted that non-climate predictors will be most influential to model fit and predictive performance at local spatial resolution for the former species and at landscape resolution for the latter species. We compared residuals autocovariate -boosted regression tree (RAC-BRT) model statistics with and without species-specific non-climate predictors (habitat, soil, fire, water and topography), at local-and landscape-level spatial resolutions (5 and 50 km). As predicted, the influence of non-climate predictors on model fit and predictive performance (compared with climate-only models) was greater at 50 compared with 5 km resolution for M. rufus and M. fuliginosus and the opposite trend was observed for M. giganteus. The results for M. robustus and M. antilopinus were inconclusive. Also notable was the difference in inter-scale importance of climate predictors in the presence of non-climate predictors. In conclusion, differences in autecology, particularly relating to space use, may contribute to the importance of non-climate predictors at a given scale, not model scale per se. Further exploration of this concept across a range of species is encouraged and findings may contribute to more effective conservation and management of species at ecologically meaningful scales.",,,,"Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Gregory, Stephen D/A-1471-2010; Croft, David B/Q-7049-2019; Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013; Ritchie, Euan/N-1088-2014","Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Gregory, Stephen D/0000-0002-8230-0191; Croft, David B/0000-0002-6320-0582; Fordham, Damien A/0000-0003-2137-5592; Ritchie, Euan/0000-0003-4410-8868",ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [DP1096427],"We are grateful to the many organizations and individuals who provided occurrence data for our models (see list in Appendix S1 of Supporting Information).

In predator communities, interspecific interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors; therefore, the behavioural patterns of composing species will differ due to locally adapted interactions. We deployed 32-41 camera-traps in five study areas across the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the temporal relations between mesocarnivores in SW Europe. The selection for a period of the diel cycle and plasticity in activity patterns was evaluated using the Jacobs Selection Index (JSI) and the coefficient of activity overlap (a dagger(1)). Furthermore, we investigated whether temporal shifts can facilitate coexistence by reducing activity overlap. Seven species of mesocarnivores were detected and were assigned into one of three behaviourally distinct groups: diurnal (JSI(day) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8), strictly nocturnal (JSI(night) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.8) or facultative nocturnal species (0.4 a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand JSI(night) > 0.8). Most species exhibited substantial flexibility, which allowed them to locally adapt their foraging strategies (intraspecific a dagger(1) = 0.70-0.77). Mean Delta(1) from all interspecific pairwise comparisons was negatively correlated with the number of carnivore species with a parts per thousand yen10 detections (r -0.76, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that temporal segregation is likely to play an important role in facilitating mesocarnivore coexistence, especially with increasing community complexity, where most species' activity peaks were asynchronous.

We simulated long-term effects of bole-only harvesting of aspen (Populus tremuloides) on stand productivity and interaction of CN cycles with a multiple model approach. Five models, Biome-BGC, CENTURY, FORECAST, LANDIS-II with Century-based soil dynamics, and PnET-CN, were run for 350 yr with seven harvesting events on nutrient-poor, sandy soils representing northwestern Wisconsin, United States. Twenty CN state and flux variables were summarized from the models' outputs and statistically analyzed using ordination and variance analysis methods. The multiple models' averages suggest that bole-only harvest would not significantly affect long-term site productivity of aspen, though declines in soil organic matter and soil N were significant. Along with direct N removal by harvesting, extensive leaching after harvesting before canopy closure was another major cause of N depletion. These five models were notably different in output values of the 20 variables examined, although there were some similarities for certain variables. PnET-CN produced unique results for every variable, and CENTURY showed fewer outliers and similar temporal patterns to the mean of all models. In general, we demonstrated that when there are no site-specific data for fine-scale calibration and evaluation of a single model, the multiple model approach may be a more robust approach for long-term simulations.

Because the rarity and unpredictability of naturally occurring climate extremes limits assessment of their ecological impacts, we experimentally imposed extreme drought and a midsummer heat wave over two years in a central U. S. grassland. While the ecosystem was resistant to heat waves, it was not resistant to extreme drought, which reduced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) below the lowest level measured in this grassland in almost 30 years. This extreme reduction in ecosystem function was a consequence of reduced productivity of both C-4 grasses and C-3 forbs. However, the dominant forb was negatively impacted by the drought more than the dominant grass, and this led to a reordering of species abundances within the plant community. Although this change in community composition persisted post-drought, ANPP recovered completely the year after drought due to rapid demographic responses by the dominant grass, compensating for loss of the dominant forb. Overall, these results show that an extreme reduction in ecosystem function attributable to climate extremes (e. g., low resistance) does not preclude rapid ecosystem recovery. Given that dominance by a few species is characteristic of most ecosystems, knowledge of the traits of these species and their responses to climate extremes will be key for predicting future ecosystem dynamics and function.",,,,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008",,Department of Energy Terrestrial Ecosystems Science Program [DE-FG02-04ER63892],"We thank P.

We measured net photosynthesis in apical tips of Focus gardneri collected from the intertidal zone of Friday Harbor, WA over a range of irradiance levels (0-1500 mu mol photons m(-2) S-1) at 10 degrees,14 degrees, and 18 degrees C to determine levels of saturating irradiance. We then recorded net photosynthesis at saturating irradiance in tips exposed to seawater temperatures ranging from 6 to 22 degrees C, as well as dark respiration. Results show that F. gardneri at this location has a peak in net photosynthesis at 16-18 degrees C seawater temperature, with significant declines in net photosynthesis at 20 degrees and 22 degrees C. Respiration showed a positive linear relationship with increasing seawater temperature. Using archived seawater temperature, irradiance, and tidal data, we produced a model of net photosynthesis over two years (October 2010-October 2012). Maximal seawater temperatures recorded at FHL rarely exceeded 14 degrees C, suggesting that an increase of +2 and +4 degrees C in seawater temperature would lead to increased net photosynthesis at this site. These results allowed us to develop a predictive model to forecast the net photosynthesis of F. gardneri at different intertidal elevations to explore the effects of seawater temperature and irradiance on net photosynthesis. We also examined the effects of the timing of high tide, testing the hypothesis that net photosynthesis will be highest at sites where submersion occurs during peak levels of irradiance. Our results suggest that as seawater temperatures increase (up to +4 degrees C above ambient) F. gardneri below + 1 m MLLW tidal elevation will experience increases in net photosynthesis. These analyses also suggest that the effects of environmental change may depend in part on tidal regime, which determines the extent to which algae are submerged during times of day when irradiance is high.

The model was parameterized using life history and survival data for red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) derived from experiments conducted at the National Marine Fisheries Service Kodiak laboratory. A parameterized pre-recruit model was linked to a post-recruit population dynamics model for adult male red king crab in Bristol Bay, Alaska that included commercial fishery harvest. This coupled population dynamics model was integrated with a bioeconomic model of commercial fishing sector profits to forecast how the impacts of ocean acidification on the survival of pre-recruit red king crab will affect yields and profits for the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery for a scenario that includes future ocean pH levels predictions. Expected yields and profits were projected to decline over the next 50-100 years in this scenario given reductions in pre-recruit survival due to decreasing ocean pH levels over time. The target fishing mortality used to provide management advice based on the current harvest policy for Bristol Bay red king crab also declined over time in response to declining survival rates. However, the impacts of ocean acidification due to reduced pre-recruit survival on yield and profits are likely to be limited for the next 10-20 years, and its effects will likely be masked by natural variation in pre-recruit survival. This analysis is an initial step toward a fully integrated understanding of the impact of ocean acidification on fishery yields and profits, and could be used to focus future research efforts.

We found that prey size selection depends on predator body size, temperature and the interaction between the two. Our results indicate that (i) predator-prey body-size ratios decrease with predator size at below-average temperatures and increase with predator size at above-average temperatures, and (ii) that the effect of temperature on predator-prey body-size structure will be stronger at small and large body sizes and relatively weak at intermediate sizes.

Here we provide strong support for the hypothesis that variable thermal sensitivities between a consumer and its resources can generate temperature-dependent enemy release using both a mathematical model and a field experiment. We identify three common scenarios where changes in temperature should alter enemy release based on asymmetric responses among enemies and their resources to changes in temperature: (1) the vital rates of a shared enemy are more sensitive to changes in temperature than its resources, (2) the enemy's thermal maximum for consumption is higher than the resources' maxima for growth, and (3) the invading resource has a higher thermal maximum for growth than its native competitor. Mathematical representations indicated that warming is capable of altering enemy release in each of these three scenarios. We also tested our hypothesis using a mesocosm warming experiment in a system that exhibits variable thermal sensitivities between a predator and its native and nonnative prey.. We conducted a six-week experiment manipulating the presence of Lepomis sunfish (present, absent) and water temperature (ambient, heated) using the nonnative crustacean zooplankter, Daphnia lumholtzi, whose morphological defenses reduce predation from juvenile sunfish relative to native Daphnia pulex. Our results indicate that D. lumholtzi benefited to a greater extent from the presence of Lepomis predators as temperatures increase. Taken together, our model and experiment indicate that changes in environmental temperature may directly influence the success of nonnative species and may assist with forecasting the community consequences of biological invasions in a warming world.",,,,,,EPA's STAR program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1110369],"We thank the Ives lab and the Cottingham lab for input that greatly improved earlier drafts of the manuscript; C.

For species living on rocky intertidal shores extreme heat stress occurs when hot dry aerial conditions coincide with midday low tides. We used empirical and modelled temperature data, and estimates of cumulative aerial exposure and solar radiation, in order to test the hypothesis that heat stress on Australian rocky intertidal shores decreases with increasing latitude. Location Rocky intertidal shores of south-eastern Australia spanning > 1500 km and 13 degrees of latitude (26 degrees 24'23 '' S to 39 degrees 07'47 '' S). Methods In situ temperature measurements, hourly tidal elevations and daily solar radiation taken over three consecutive summers (December 2009-February 2012) were used to quantify latitudinal variability in extreme heat stress, cumulative aerial exposure and solar radiation, respectively. Comparisons between hourly in situ temperatures and meteorological data were used to produce a large-scale statistical model capable of estimating intertidal substratum temperatures during daytime low-tides, which was then extrapolated across 22 locations. Results Heat stress estimated using in situ loggers deployed across five east coast locations typically did not decline with increasing latitude and neither did midday exposure or solar radiation. The meteorological model proved to be a successful method for estimating rocky shore heat stress and in contrast to the empirical data displayed strong latitudinal trends in mean daily maxima and cumulative heat stress. Modelled acute heat stress (i.e. summer maxima), however, did not decline with increasing latitude, as there was greater thermal variability at higher latitudes. Main conclusions The meteorological model developed in this study represents a useful approach for estimating broad-scale patterns of heat stress on rocky intertidal shores. Results also indicate that latitudinal patterns of acute and chronic heat stress may differ from average temperatures, which are commonly assumed to decline with increasing latitude. Such broad-scale patterns of thermal stress as described in this study will significantly contribute to our ability to understand the impact of climate change on vulnerable rocky intertidal communities.",,,,"Ayre, David J/A-8761-2008","Ayre, David J/0000-0002-3124-4417; Lathlean, Justin/0000-0003-3399-5393",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0666787]; University of Wollongong; Institute for Conservation Biology and Environmental Management at the University of Wollongong,"We thank Russell McWilliam, Lucia Aguilar and Andrew Swan for assistance in the field, and Aidan Johnson, Dave Roberts and Elizabeth Lathlean for constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

While WNV incidence has been linked to environmental factors, particularly temperature and rainfall, little is known about how future climate change may affect the spread of the disease. Using available data on WNV infections in vectors and hosts collected from 20032011 and using a suite of 10 species distribution models, weighted according to their predictive performance, we modeled the incidence of WNV under current climate conditions at a continental scale. Models were found to accurately predict spatial patterns of WNV that were then used to examine how future climate may affect the spread of the disease. Predictions were accurate for cases of human WNV infection in the following year (2012), with areas reporting infections having significantly higher probability of presence as predicted by our models. Projected geographic distributions of WNV in North America under future climate for 2050 and 2080 show an expansion of suitable climate for the disease, driven by warmer temperatures and lower annual precipitation that will result in the exposure of new and naive host populations to the virus with potentially serious consequences.

The most common response to this damage is to implement strategies to lower population densities. However, lowering deer density may not always be desirable from hunting, recreational, or conservation perspectives. Therefore, knowledge is needed about additional factors beyond deer density that affect damage levels, and management actions that consider competing management goals. We studied the relationships between levels of bark-stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) and (1) relative deer density indices (pellet group count and deer harvest data), (2) availability of alternative natural forage (cover of forage species) and (3) proportion forest in the landscape, both at a forest stand scale and at a landscape scale. Extensive variation in damage level was evident between the six study areas. On a stand scale, the proportion of spruce damaged was positively related to pellet group density, indicating the importance of local deer usage of stands. In addition, available alternative forage in the field layer within spruce stands and proportion forest surrounding stands was negatively related to damage level. On the landscape scale, damage level was negatively related to availability of forage in the field and shrub layers and proportion forest, but was not related to any of the relative deer density indices. Increasing alternative forage may thus decrease damage and thereby reduce conflicts. Additionally, the proportion of forest in the landscape affects damage levels and should thus be considered in landscape planning and when forecasting damage risk. The relationship between local deer usage of stands and damage level suggests that future studies should try to separate the effects of local deer usage and deer density.",,,,,"Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091; Minderman, Jeroen/0000-0002-8451-5540; Bunnefeld, Nils/0000-0002-1349-4463; Zidar, Josefina/0000-0002-1622-5752",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry through Stiftelsen Carl-Fredrik von Horns fond,"The study was financed by The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and The Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry through Stiftelsen Carl-Fredrik von Horns fond.

Perhaps no other pair of variables in ecology has generated as much discussion as species richness and ecosystem productivity, as illustrated by the reactions by Pierce (2013) and others to Adler et al.'s (2011) report that empirical patterns are weak and inconsistent. Adler et al. (2011) argued we need to move beyond a focus on simplistic bivariate relationships and test mechanistic, multivariate causal hypotheses. We feel the continuing debate over productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) provides a focused context for illustrating the fundamental difficulties of using bivariate relationships to gain scientific understanding. 2. Pierce (2013) disputes Adler et al.'s (2011) conclusion that bivariate productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) are 'weak and variable'. He argues, instead, that relationships in the Adler et al. data are actually strong and, further, that failure to adhere to the humped-back model (HBM; sensu Grime 1979) threatens scientists' ability to advise conservationists. Here, we show that Pierce's reanalyses are invalid, that statistically significant boundary relations in the Adler et al. data are difficult to detect when proper methods are used and that his advice neither advances scientific understanding nor provides the quantitative forecasts actually needed by decision makers. 3. We begin by examining Grimes' HBM through the lens of causal networks. We first translate the ideas contained in the HBM into a causal diagram, which shows explicitly how multiple processes are hypothesized to control biomass production and richness and their interrelationship. We then evaluate the causal diagram using structural equation modelling and example data from a published study of meadows in Finland. Formal analysis rejects the literal translation of the HBM and reveals additional processes at work. This exercise shows how the practice of abstracting systems as causal networks (i) clarifies possible hypotheses, (ii) permits explicit testing and (iii) provides more powerful and useful predictions. 4. Building on the Finnish meadow example, we contrast the utility of bivariate plots compared with structural equation models for investigating underlying processes. Simulations illustrate the fallibility of bivariate analysis as a means of supporting one theory over another, while models based on causal networks can quantify the sensitivity of diversity patterns to both management and natural constraints. 5. A key piece of Pierce's critique of Adler et al.'s conclusions relies on upper boundary regression which he claims to reveal strong relationships between production and richness in Adler et al.'s original data. We demonstrate that this technique shows strong associations in purely random data and is invalid for Adler et al.'s data because it depends on a uniform data distribution. We instead perform quantile regression on both the site-level summaries of the data and the plot-level data (using mixed-model quantile regression). Using a variety of nonlinear curve-fitting approaches, we were unable to detect a significant humped-shape boundary in the Adler et al. data. We reiterate that the bivariate productivity-richness relationships in Adler et al.'s data are weak and variable. 6. We urge ecologists to consider productivity-richness relationships through the lens of causal networks to advance our understanding beyond bivariate analysis. Further, we emphasize that models based on a causal network conceptualization can also provide more meaningful guidance for conservation management than can a bivariate perspective. Measuring only two variables does not permit the evaluation of complex ideas nor resolve debates about underlying mechanisms.",,,,"Harpole, William S/C-2814-2013; Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009; Grace, James/B-8472-2009","Harpole, William S/0000-0002-3404-9174; Grace, James/0000-0001-6374-4726; Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259; Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853",USGS Ecosystems Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1054040]; Utah State University; National Science Foundation Research Coordination Network program [NSF-DEB-1042132]; National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research programNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-DEB-1234162]; Institute on the Environment [DG-0001-13],We acknowledge Heli Jutila for the availability of data used in some of our illustrations and Marco Geraci for advice on the use of the lqmm package for mixed-model quantile regression.

Understanding the extent to which organisms are affected by climate change and are capable of adapting to warming is essential for managing biodiversity. Recent macrophysiological analyses suggest that range-related responses to warming may be more coherent (less variable) and predictable in marine than in terrestrial systems. 2. To examine this generalization, we investigate basal upper thermal tolerances (measured as CTmax), the extent of their phenotypic plasticity and the impacts of different rates of temperature change on these tolerances, in five species of intertidal crustaceans from three distinct thermal regimes, incorporating South African (RSA) shores and sub-Antarctic Marion Island (MI). 3. For all species, lower rates of change resulted in lower CTmax, while acclimation resulted in varied responses depending on the rate of temperature change. At fast rates of temperature change, higher temperature acclimation resulted in elevated CTmax, while at slow rates of change, acclimation had no effect or resulted in a decline in CTmax. 4. Maximum habitat temperatures recorded at the organisms' microsites were lower than the CTmax for the MI populations but were above CTmax at slow rates of change for RSA populations. Thus, populations from more equatorward locations have a lower tolerance of extremes than those from cooler regions. In addition to reduced warming tolerance, RSA populations had a lower acclimation capacity than their sub-Antarctic counterparts. 5. We find substantial differences in long-term responses among groups in different areas as a consequence of spatial variation in the interactions among basal tolerance, phenotypic plasticity and thermal environments. These outcomes emphasize the significance of examining forecasts using a range of data and approaches so that their certainty can be established to inform key policy decisions in a spatially appropriate context.",,,,"Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011","Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105; Faulkner, Katelyn/0000-0002-3955-353X",British Antarctic Survey [41326]; National Research Foundation [SNA2007042400003]; South African National Antarctic Programme,"We thank the Seapoint Research Aquarium, Cape Town, and Erika Nortje, Charlene Janion, Richard Viljoen and Kriek Bekker for logistic support.

However, spatial autocorrelation (SA) is rarely accounted for in these models, despite its ubiquity in broad-scale ecological data. While spatial autocorrelation in model residuals is known to result in biased parameter estimates and the inflation of type I errors, the influence of unmodeled SA on species' range forecasts is poorly understood. Here we quantify how accounting for SA in SDMs influences the magnitude of range shift forecasts produced by SDMs for multiple climate change scenarios. SDMs were fitted to simulated data with a known autocorrelation structure, and to field observations of three mangrove communities from northern Australia displaying strong spatial autocorrelation. Three modeling approaches were implemented: environment-only models (most frequently applied in species' range forecasts), and two approaches that incorporate SA; autologistic models and residuals autocovariate (RAC) models. Differences in forecasts among modeling approaches and climate scenarios were quantified. While all model predictions at the current time closely matched that of the actual current distribution of the mangrove communities, under the climate change scenarios environment-only models forecast substantially greater range shifts than models incorporating SA. Furthermore, the magnitude of these differences intensified with increasing increments of climate change across the scenarios. When models do not account for SA, forecasts of species' range shifts indicate more extreme impacts of climate change, compared to models that explicitly account for SA. Therefore, where biological or population processes induce substantial autocorrelation in the distribution of organisms, and this is not modeled, model predictions will be inaccurate. These results have global importance for conservation efforts as inaccurate forecasts lead to ineffective prioritization of conservation activities and potentially to avoidable species extinctions.",,,,"Fukuda, Yusuke/AAN-4676-2020; Liedloff, Adam C/D-7004-2011; Vesk, Peter/AAG-9970-2020","Fukuda, Yusuke/0000-0002-8675-318X; Vesk, Peter/0000-0003-2008-7062; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950; Liedloff, Adam/0000-0002-6225-1740",Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; National Environmental Research Program (NERP) Decisions Hub; Australian Research Council Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT 100100819]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council,"BC was supported by an Australian Postgraduate Award, and the National Environmental Research Program (NERP) Decisions Hub.

For blue oak (Quercus douglasii), an endemic, flagship species in California, we modeled potential responses to future climate, then tested the fit of those projections to empirical field data from natural populations. Specifically, we tested how well species forecasts captured observed recruitment and adult tree mortality, and whether recruitment was structured spatially as a function of fine-scale microtopographic and hydrologic environments. In this ecoregional case study, observed demographic patterns were broadly consistent with theoretical expectations. Adult survivorship was three times lower in areas forecasted to be least suitable as a result of climate change than in areas projected to become suitable. This novel field validation exercise documents patterns of adult tree mortality consistent with model predictions of an emergent shift in distribution.

Automated online sondes have been widely used for in situ real-time monitoring of water quality due to their high reliability and low cost. However, the knowledge of using real-time data from those sondes to forecast phytoplankton blooms has been seldom addressed. Here we present an integrated system for real-time observation, early warning and forecasting of phytoplankton blooms by integrating automated online sondes and the ecological model. Specifically, based on the high-frequency data from automated online sondes in Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir, we successfully developed 1-4 days ahead forecasting models for chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration with hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEM). With the predicted concentration of chl a, we achieved a high precision in 1-7 days ahead early warning of good (chl a < 25 mu g/L) and eutrophic (chl a 8-25 mu g/L) conditions; however only achieved an acceptable precision in 1-2 days ahead early warning of hypertrophic condition (chl a >= 25 mu g/L). Our study shows that the optimized HEM achieved an acceptable performance in real-time short-term forecasting and early warning of phytoplankton blooms with the data from the automated in situ sondes. This system provides an efficient way in real-time monitoring and early warning of phytoplankton blooms, and may have a wide application in eutrophication monitoring and management.

Wavelet coherency can examine both correlations and time lags between cyanobacteria growth and water quality conditions at different time scales. This research applied the wavelet analysis to irregularly measured limnological data of the Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu from 2010 to 2011. It aimed to better understand time lags between water quality conditions and cyanobacteria growth in this shallow-polymictic and hypereutrophic lake. Results from this research revealed time lags of 2 days in relation to water transparency measured as Secchi depth, and time lags of 3 days for both ammonia (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N).

We explore these issues for the San Diego cactus wren, a California Species of Special Concern. To assess the relative benefit of different post-fire habitat restoration strategies, we forecasted wren abundance over the next 100 years under three restoration strategies: (i) create new ""stepping stone"" habitat patches to form corridors which connect existing patches, (ii) augment existing habitat patches, and (iii) create new habitat patches in areas with low fire risk. We considered both small-scale and large-scale restoration efforts of 20 and 200 ha of habitat, respectively. To forecast wren abundance, we used a meta-population model created from maps of wren abundance, cactus abundance, land use, and estimated fire probability. Estimates of fire probability were obtained by relating previous fire locations to environmental variables and human population density. Results indicate that the best management strategy for a 20-ha restoration effort is to augment habitat in patches habitable for wrens, and that the best strategy for 180 ha of additional restoration (or 200 total hectares) is to improve wren dispersal via new corridors. Results also indicate that there is no decline in long-term wren abundance caused by planning the first 20 ha of restoration separately from planning a subsequent 180 ha. Our modeling approach provides insight into the relative benefit of several realistic restoration scenarios, providing an important tool for species conservation and habitat restoration on complex landscapes.

The U.S. Geological Survey has produced spatially explicit, thematically detailed LULC projections for the conterminous United States. Four qualitative and quantitative scenarios of LULC change were developed, with characteristics consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). The four quantified scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2) served as input to the forecasting scenarios of land-use change (FORE-SCE) model. Four spatially explicit data sets consistent with scenario storylines were produced for the conterminous United States, with annual LULC maps from 1992 through 2100. The future projections are characterized by a loss of natural land covers in most scenarios, with corresponding expansion of anthropogenic land uses. Along with the loss of natural land covers, remaining natural land covers experience increased fragmentation under most scenarios, with only the B2 scenario remaining relatively stable in both the proportion of remaining natural land covers and basic fragmentation measures. Forest stand age was also modeled. By 2100, scenarios and ecoregions with heavy forest cutting had relatively lower mean stand ages compared to those with less forest cutting. Stand ages differed substantially between unprotected and protected forest lands, as well as between different forest classes. The modeled data were compared to the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and other data sources to assess model characteristics. The consistent, spatially explicit, and thematically detailed LULC projections and the associated forest stand-age data layers have been used to analyze LULC impacts on carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes, biodiversity, climate and weather variability, hydrologic change, and other ecological processes.",,,,"Reker, Ryan/G-4875-2016; Sohl, Terry/W-5486-2019","Reker, Ryan/0000-0001-7524-0082; Sohl, Terry/0000-0002-9771-4231; Bouchard, Michelle/0000-0002-6353-3491; Soulard, Christopher/0000-0002-5777-9516; Wilson, Tamara/0000-0001-7399-7532; Sayler, Kristi/0000-0003-2514-242X; Knuppe, Michelle L/0000-0002-0374-9477","U.S. Geological Survey's Climate and Land Use Program; USGSUnited States Geological Survey [G10PC00044, 08PC91508]","Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Climate and Land Use Program.

However, hunting license sales are declining, leading many state wildlife management agencies to re-evaluate funding and management structures. Understanding the mechanisms behind such declines, and diagnosing the persistence of such trends is necessary to anticipate license fund fluctuations. To examine hunter recruitment and retention rates, we analyzed a data set of >490,000 deer and elk license records from 2002 to 2011 from the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks' Automated Licensing System. We used a temporal symmetry model in a mark-recapture framework to estimate hunter retention, recruitment rates, and population change, and then used population change estimates to forecast future hunter populations. We used covariates of gender, age, residency, and license price to improve model parsimony. Millennial generation hunters increased during the 11-year analysis, and this was driven by high recruitment rates of young hunters, especially women, but recruitment decreased dramatically as youth aged. Because Baby Boomers constitute such a large proportion of the hunting population, decreases in recruitment and retention in this cohort drove declines in the Montana hunter population. Increasing license price decreased the probability of recruiting and retaining hunters. The hunter population was stable until 2006, but has been declining since that time with nearly a 50% decline in hunter recruitment from 2002 to 2011.

Is it possible to model the Ellenberg moisture value (mF) using variables representing site moisture conditions? Does mF help predict changes in vegetation composition and thus help in validating restoration success? Location: Danube floodplain, Neuburg a. d. Donau, Bavaria, Germany. Methods: A Generalized additive model (GAM) and a generalized linear model (GLM) were used for spatial prediction of mF using groundwater, relief and soil variables as predictors. Vegetation response to a changed hydrological regime was tested through replacing the old groundwater model with a new model representing the new water regime. With the help of a GIS, a spatial distribution and a scenario map of mF was produced. Model validation was done by cross-validation and comparison between predicted and observed data from repeated vegetation sampling on permanent plots. Results: Groundwater level (minima of 2009) and soil thickness entered the final model as significant predictors of mF. The GAM of mF showed good predictive power, with more than 57% of deviance explained. The corresponding GLM had slightly lower accuracy, with 51% of deviance explained. Using the new groundwater model (minima of 2011) it was possible to forecast mF after restoration. Changes in mF are to be expected in areas directly affected by restoration measures. The model validation has proven that the quality of model prediction is good and represents the reality fairly well. Conclusions: The study has shown that mF is a useful indicator for a summary prediction of ecological change. It can be expected that restoration will turn overall conditions wetter, and vegetation will respond to these changes with an increase of wetland plant species. With the help of the model, it is possible to measure the success of the restoration project. It is demonstrated that GAM can be used for intensive data exploration, after which a less complex and easily computable GLM can be parameterized.",,,,,"Ewald, Jorg/0000-0002-2758-9324",German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation,"We thank the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation for their financial support of the monitoring research.

These changes are integrated into the tissues of apex predators over space and time and can be quantified using stable isotopes in the inert feathers of historical and contemporary avian specimens. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) from Western and South Australia from 1936-2011. The Flesh-footed Shearwaters more than doubled their trophic niche (from 3.91 +/- 1.37 parts per thousand(2) to 10.00 +/- 1.79 parts per thousand(2)), and dropped an entire trophic level in 75 years (predicted delta N-15 decreased from +16.9 parts per thousand to + 13.5 parts per thousand, and d 13 C from -16.9 parts per thousand to -17.9 parts per thousand) - the largest change in delta N-15 yet reported in any marine bird, suggesting a relatively rapid shift in the composition of the Indian Ocean food web, or changes in baseline delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. A stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation results in a weaker Leeuwin Current in Western Australia, and decreased Flesh-footed Shearwater delta C-13 and delta N-15. Current climate forecasts predict this trend to continue, leading to increased oceanic 'tropicalization' and potentially competition between Flesh-footed Shearwaters and more tropical sympatric species with expanding ranges. Flesh-footed Shearwater populations are declining, and current conservation measures aimed primarily at bycatch mitigation are not restoring populations. Widespread shifts in foraging, as shown here, may explain some of the reported decline. An improved understanding and ability to mitigate the impacts of global climactic changes is therefore critical to the long-term sustainability of this declining species.",,,,"; Lavers, Jennifer/O-4831-2017","Bond, Alexander/0000-0003-2125-7238; Lavers, Jennifer/0000-0001-7596-6588",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Environment Canada; W.V.

To tackle this issue, we modeled the dynamics of a regional meta-community, composed either of ecologically equivalent species (neutral model) or of generalist and specialist species (specialization model), and explored the impact of the overall reduction, patch conversion or alteration of an original habitat into one or several other habitats of different total carrying capacity on the community metrics at equilibrium. Our simulations reveal strong interactions between the community model considered (neutral or specialization model) and the type of habitat change. Under neutrality, the impact of habitat changes on richness can be approached by a power law species-individual relationship (SIR), which may at constant density be simplified into the widely used power law species-area relationship (SAR), independent of the type of change. However, in the presence of generalist and specialist species, we found that 1) while habitat reduction in area also leads to approximately power law SIRs and SARs, 2) patch conversion and alteration have more complex effects on regional species richness, and 3) habitat alteration elicits the functional homogenization of communities, involving a decrease of their average level of specialization.",,,,,,,,,,3,3,0,15,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2014,123,7,,,,,857,865,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00928.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000337744900011,,,,,

Here, we combine fine-scale climatic and dynamic land cover models to forecast species vulnerability in rain forest habitats. Location Sulawesi, Indonesia. Methods We sampled bird communities on four mountains across three seasons in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia (a globally important hotspot of avian endemism), to characterize relationships between elevation and abundance. Deforestation from 2000 to 2010 was quantified, and predictors of deforestation were identified. Future forest area was projected under two land use change scenarios - one assuming current deforestation rates and another assuming a 50% reduction in deforestation. A digital elevation model and an adiabatic lapse rate were used to create a fine-scale map of temperature in the national park. Then, the effects of climate change were projected by fitting statistical models of species abundance as a function of current temperature and forecasting future abundance based on warming from low-and high-emissions climate change. Results The national park lost 11.8% of its forest from 2000 to 2010. Model-based projections indicate that high-elevation species (white-eared myza Myza sarasinorum and Sulawesi leaf-warbler Phylloscopus sarasinorum) might be buffered from deforestation because their ranges are isolated from human settlement, but these species may face steep population declines from climate change (by as much as 61%). The middle-elevation sulphur-bellied whistler Pachycephala sulfuriventer is predicted to undergo minor declines from climate change (8-11% reduction), while deforestation is predicted to cause larger declines of 13-19%. Main conclusions The biological richness and rapid deforestation now occurring inside the national park emphasize the need for increased enforcement, while our modelling suggests that climate change is most threatening to high-elevation endemics. These findings are likely applicable to other highland tropical sites where deforestation is encroaching from below and climate change is stressing high-elevation species from above.",,,,"Gregory, Stephen D/A-1471-2010; Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011","Gregory, Stephen D/0000-0002-8230-0191; Fordham, Damien A/0000-0003-2137-5592; Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517",Loke Wan Tho Memorial Foundation; EIPR scholarship at the University of Adelaide,"Abdul Rahman gave dedicated assistance in the field over several months.

These species comprise the biodiversity of any given community. Common biodiversity metrics such as richness, evenness, and the species abundance distribution are frequently used to describe biodiversity across ecosystems and taxonomic groups. While it is increasingly clear that researchers will need to forecast changes in biodiversity, ecology currently lacks a framework for understanding the natural background variability in biodiversity or how biodiversity patterns will respond to environmental change. We predict that while species populations depend on local ecological mechanisms (e.g., niche processes) and should respond strongly to disturbance, community-level properties that emerge from these species should generally be less sensitive to disturbance because they depend on regional mechanisms (e.g., compensatory dynamics). Using published data from terrestrial animal communities, we show that community-level properties were generally resilient under a suite of artificial and natural manipulations. In contrast, species responded readily to manipulation. Our results suggest that community-level measures are poor indicators of change, perhaps because many systems display strong compensatory dynamics maintaining community-level properties. We suggest that ecologists consider using multiple metrics that measure composition and structure in biodiversity response studies.",,,,"Ernest, S.K. Morgan/O-2532-2015","Ernest, S.K.

However, some plant species could have persisted during Quaternary climate oscillations without shifting their range, despite the limited evidence from fossils. Here, we tested two candidate mechanisms of persistence by comparing the macrorefugia and microrefugia (MR) hypotheses. We used the rare and endemic Saxifraga florulenta as a model taxon and combined ensembles of species distribution models (SDMs) with a high-resolution paleoclimatic and topographic dataset to reconstruct its potential current and past distribution since the last glacial maximum. To test the macrorefugia hypothesis, we verified whether the species could have persisted in or shifted to geographic areas defined by its realized niche. We then identified potential MR based on climatic and topographic properties of the landscape and applied refined scenarios of MR dynamics and functions over time. Last, we quantified the number of known occurrences that could be explained by either the macrorefugia or MR model. A consensus of two or three SDM techniques predicted absence between 14-10, 3-4 and 1 ka BP, which did not support the macrorefugia model. In contrast, we showed that S. florulenta could have contracted into MR during periods of absence predicted by the SDMs and later re-colonized suitable areas according to the macrorefugia model. Assuming a limited and realistic seed dispersal distance for our species, we explained a large number of the current occurrences (61-96%). Additionally, we showed that MR could have facilitated range expansions or shifts of S. florulenta. Finally, we found that the most recent and the most stable MR were the ones closest to current occurrences. Hence, we propose a novel paradigm to explain plant persistence by highlighting the importance of supporting functions of MR when forecasting the fate of plant species under climate change.",,,,"Conti, Elena/G-3720-2010; Theodoridis, Spyros/AAM-2670-2020; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Randin, Christophe F/K-6969-2016","Theodoridis, Spyros/0000-0001-5188-7033; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Randin, Christophe F/0000-0002-4171-0178; Patsiou, Theofania-Sotiria/0000-0002-5108-8482",ProDoc Research Module in Plant Sciences and Policy of the Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [132471]; Claraz Foundation,"We thank the staff of the two national parks in our study area (Monique Perfus, Jean Ichter, Patrique Ormea; Parc National du Mercantour and Dr. Patrizia Rossi and Mr. Luca Giraudo; Parco Naturale Alpi Marittime), the Conservatoire Botanique National Mediterraneen de Porquerolles administrative departments of Piemonte, Provincia di Cuneo (Italy) and the Province de Cote d'Azur (France).

We forecast how marine molluscan faunas might respond to environmental change over the remainder of this century. We test the hypotheses that suitable areas will shift northwards for studied species, and that species will show varied responses to future climate change. Location North and South America and the Caribbean. Methods We generated ecological niche models (in GARP and Maxent) for 14 ecologically, economically and potentially medically important mollusc species, using present-day summaries and future forecasts of climate from the Hadley Centre and known species occurrence data from natural history collections. Niche models were used to forecast potential distributions according to three scenarios of future change for three time slices. Results Northern extremes of suitability are predicted to shift northwards for only three (GARP) or four (Maxent) of the 14 species, whereas the southern edge of suitability is predicted to shift southwards for seven (GARP) and one (Maxent) of the 14 species. When changes in the geographical centroids of suitability are considered, no significant poleward shifts are anticipated for individual species. Instead, half of the study species (many economically important) experience substantial (>20%) loss of suitable environmental area, even under the lowest-emission future climate scenario. Furthermore, the direction and magnitude of the response to predicted climate change is species-specific. Main conclusions We do not find a coherent pattern of areas with suitable environments expanding at high-latitude range boundaries, with simultaneous contraction at their low-latitude boundaries. Tropical marine molluscs may thus show varied responses as average temperatures warm. These results contrast with trends among terrestrial and other marine species, which are rapidly shifting their ranges to higher latitudes. Conversely, the differing responses of these species to future warming are consistent with responses of species to past episodes of change, as observed in the fossil record.",,,,,"Saupe, Erin/0000-0002-0370-9897",Madison & Lila Self Graduate Student Fellowship; University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute Panorama Society and Department of Geology;  [NSF-EF-1206757],"Comments from several anonymous referees improved this contribution considerably.

Water availability is the most limiting factor for plant performance in arid environments, where it is often highly pulsed, and discrete rainfall events interspersed with drought periods are the important components of the annual water supply. Therefore, relatively small changes in rainfall frequency can have strong effects on the plant communities. We tested the effects of fewer rain events on inflorescence and fruit phenology, and reproductive success of a Mediterranean shrub species from semiarid SE Spain in a glasshouse trial. We found that by changing patterns of water supply, we strongly altered soil drying cycles with consequences for Phagnalon saxatile life history. Inflorescence and fruit phenology were not affected, and no changes in the number of inflorescences, fruits or fruit set were recorded. However, individuals growing under lower rainfall frequency produced bigger shoots, and heavier fruits and seeds. Bigger fruits produced a higher number of seeds that were heavier and more viable and, therefore, produced more seedlings than plants growing in the control treatment. Higher reproductive success achieved by Phagnalon individuals under low watering frequency may have important consequences for community dynamics if larger but less frequent rain events lead to an increase in soil water availability: natural selection favours individuals making the greatest contribution to the next generation. Such advantages could change community composition, the spatial distribution of species and their interactions.",,,,"Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Miranda, Juande/C-4485-2011","Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; ","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2004-00090, CGL2007-63718, CGL2010-17081]; FPUSpanish Government [AP2002-1216]; MICINNSpanish Government [PTA2007-0261-I]","The Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation funded this work (grants CGL2004-00090, CGL2007-63718 and CGL2010-17081).

A holdout is a population that persists in a microclimate for a limited period of time under deteriorating climatic conditions. Stepping stones successively occupy microclimates in a way that facilitates species' range shifts.

(Nyctaginaceae) is the only native species of Oxybaphus occurring outside of the Western Hemisphere. Unfortunately, very little is known about the distribution of this species in Nepal, despite it being endemic to the Trans-Himalayas. In the earlier collections it was mis-identified as another very common Nyctaginaceae species Boerhavia diffusa L We used species distribution modelling technique to determine the climate space of these two species. We used an SDM ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to identified the bioclimatic variable that defines the climate space for B. diffusa and O. himalaicus. Species distributions were modelled using a subset of least correlated variables from bioclimatic data and elevation dataset. The most favourable conditions for B. diffusa were centrally located at well-drained and hot lowlands of Nepal whereas that of O. himalaicus was located in highlands valleys. Discontinuities in suitable climatic conditions coincided with biogeographical barriers associated with topographic transitions. The rising slope of mountains limit the climatic suitability of B. diffusa particularly due to low temperature and high aridity, whereas this condition was suitable for O. himalaicus. But presence of high Himalayas fragmented the suitable climatic condition for this species. We speculate that historic climatic changes associated with changes in the geology of the Himalayas, formed by tectonic forces and sculpted by weathering and erosion, are responsible for the fragmentation of habitat of this species. The extensive study of such a species could provide insight into the history of species colonization in the Himalayas, as well as the potential distribution of Himalayan species.

Both sources of data serve to forecast poult recruitment and gobbling activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate if these data can serve as a viable predictor of gobbling activity. We used three mixed models to investigate the relationship between the number of jakes observed per hour of hunting 1 y prior and the total number of poults per hens 2 y prior (model 1), number of gobblers heard per hour of hunting and the number of jakes observed per hour of hunting 1 y prior (model 2), the number of gobblers heard per hour of hunting and the total number poults per total hens observed 2 y prior (model 3) using data from 1995 to 2008 among five wild turkey management regions encompassing the state.

The first two objectives of this study characterize the spatial and temporal variability in snow over the sea ice of western Hudson Bay measured from satellite (2002-2010) and how this variability relates to ringed seal pup demographic parameters. The final objective uses a regional circulation model (RCM) to estimate the future snow cover within the study area. Results indicated that the snow cover experienced interannual and interseasonal variability, however, typically increased in late spring. In addition, the Moran's I statistics indicated clustering at small spatial lags for both seasons, suggesting similar snow depths (i.e., large-scale drifting) occurring at distances of 125 km. There was greater interannual variability in the clustering of snow during spring, compared to the winter season. These trends in snow depth were related to variability in seal pup survival; however, seal pup growth and body condition were not related to winter/spring snow conditions. The results from the RCM member runs suggest that snow will decrease by the end of this century, with a larger decrease occurring in the spring period. In addition, there will also be an increase in interannual and spatial variability during both seasons, which may have significant consequences to ringed seal population abundance through reduced pup survival within the study area.",,,,,,Nunavut Wildlife Management Board; Department of Fisheries and Oceans; ArcticNet Centre of Excellence; University of Manitoba,"The authors wish to thank Pritichanda Nayak from the Centre for Earth Observation Science (CEOS), University of Manitoba for her assistance in processing the AMSR-E imagery and Brent Young from CEOS and the University of Manitoba for processing the seal pup samples and providing the body condition parameters.

Ascertaining the relative importance of environmental factors can, however, be difficult given the numerous mechanisms through which they affect individuals. This is especially true in dynamic and complex estuarine environments. Here, we develop long-term otolith-based indices of recruitment and growth for estuary perch Percalates colonorum (Bemm River, Australia), to explore the importance of intrinsic (individual, demographic) and extrinsic (hydrologic, climatic, density-dependent) factors in driving estuarine fish productivity. Analyses involved a novel zero-inflated specification of catch curve regression and mixed effects modelling. The 39years of recruitment and 46years of growth data, spanning a period of environmental change including severe drought, displayed considerable inter-annual variation. Recruitment success was strongly related to high freshwater inflows during the spawning season, suggesting that these conditions act as spawning cues for adults and potentially provide favourable conditions for larvae. Individuals displayed age-dependent growth, with highest rates observed at younger ages in years characterized by warm temperatures, and to a lesser degree, greater magnitude base inflow conditions. We detected systematic among-year-class growth differences, but these were not attributable to year class strength, suggesting that environmental conditions experienced by individuals as juveniles can have long-lasting effects of greater importance to population productivity than density-dependent growth responses. The primacy of temperature in driving growth variation highlights that under-appreciated climatic variation can affect estuarine fish productivity through direct physiological and indirect food web mechanisms. We predict that climatic warming will promote individual growth in southerly populations of P. colonorum but concurrently limit recruitment due to forecast reductions in spawning season river discharge. Disparate trait responses are likely in other fishes as they respond to multiple and changing environmental drivers, making predictions of future population productivity challenging.",,,,"Stocks, Jerom/N-9315-2016; Morrongiello, John/E-8716-2011","Stocks, Jerom/0000-0001-6425-8869; Morrongiello, John/0000-0002-9608-4151; Crook, David/0000-0003-4035-050X",OCE CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellowship; NSW Recreational Fishing Trust; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"We thank Mike Kirwan and Lyndsay Williams for collecting otoliths, the facilities at Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence for sectioning and ageing otoliths and Helen Morrongiello, Ron Thresher and Rick Stoffels for providing valuable comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

In addition, salinity tolerance of a freshwater isopod (Caecidotea sp.) and heterotrophic microbes were examined using laboratory bioassays.

However, the actual costs and benefits of maintaining flexibility remain largely unexplored, and alternative approaches for decision making under uncertainty may lead to better joint outcomes for conservation and other societal goals. For example, keeping options open for coastal ecosystems incurs opportunity costs for developers. We devised a decision framework that integrates these costs and benefits with probabilistic forecasts for the extent of sea-level rise to find a balance between coastal ecosystem protection and moderate coastal development. Here, we suggest that instead of keeping their options open managers should incorporate uncertain sea-level rise predictions into a decision-making framework that evaluates the benefits and costs of conservation and development. In our example, based on plausible scenarios for sea-level rise and assuming a risk-neutral decision maker, we found that substantial development could be accommodated with negligible loss of environmental assets. Characterization of the Pareto efficiency of conservation and development outcomes provides valuable insight into the intensity of trade-offs between development and conservation. However, additional work is required to improve understanding of the consequences of alternative spatial plans and the value judgments and risk preferences of decision makers and stakeholders. Minimizando el Costo de Mantener Opciones Abiertas para la Conservacion en un Clima Cambiante Resumen Los documentos de politica abogan que los administradores deben mantener sus opciones abiertas mientras planean proteger a los ecosistemas costeros de los impactos del cambio climatico. Sin embargo, el beneficio de mantener la flexibilidad permanece en su mayoria sin explorar y los acercamientos alternativos para la toma de decisiones bajo incertidumbre pueden llevar a mejores resultados conjuntos para la conservacion y otras metas sociales. Por ejemplo, mantener las opciones abiertas para los ecosistemas costeros incurre en costos de oportunidad para los desarrolladores. Disenamos un marco de trabajo de decision que integra estos costos con pronosticos de probabilidad para la extension del aumento en el nivel del mar para encontrar un balance entre la proteccion del ecosistema costero y el desarrollo costero moderado. Aqui sugerimos que en lugar de mantener sus opciones abiertas, los administradores deben incorporar predicciones inciertas del aumento en el nivel del mar en el marco de toma de decisiones que evalue los beneficios y los costos de la conservacion y el desarrollo. En nuestro ejemplo, basado en escenarios plausibles del aumento del nivel del mar y suponiendo que participa alguien que toma decisiones neutral al riesgo, encontramos que el desarrollo sustancial puede acomodarse con la perdida despreciable de bienes ambientales.

Higher values of minimum wood density were related to drier spring conditions, particularly in the most xeric sites, confirming that a drought-induced reduction in the radial expansion of tracheids increases earlywood density.

A common approach to produce these forecasts uses time-series models, of different types, fit to time series of counts. Similar time-series models are used in many other disciplines, however relative to the data available in these other disciplines, population data are often unusually short and noisy and models that perform well for data from other disciplines may not be appropriate for population data. In order to study the performance of time-series forecasting models for natural animal population data, we assembled 2379 time series of vertebrate population indices from actual surveys. Our data were comprised of three vastly different types: highly variable (marine fish productivity), strongly cyclic (adult salmon counts), and small variance but long-memory (bird and mammal counts). We tested the predictive performance of 49 different forecasting models grouped into three broad classes: autoregressive time-series models, non-linear regression-type models and non-parametric time-series models. Low-dimensional parametric autoregressive models gave the most accurate forecasts across a wide range of taxa; the most accurate model was one that simply treated the most recent observation as the forecast. More complex parametric and non-parametric models performed worse, except when applied to highly cyclic species. Across taxa, certain life history characteristics were correlated with lower forecast error; specifically, we found that better forecasts were correlated with attributes of slow growing species: large maximum age and size for fishes and high trophic level for birds. Synthesis Evaluating the data support for multiple plausible models has been an integral focus of many ecological analyses. However, the most commonly used tools to quantify support have weighted models' hindcasting and forecasting abilities. For many applications, predicting the past may be of little interest. Concentrating only on the future predictive performance of time series models, we performed a forecasting competition among many different kinds of statistical models, applying each to many different kinds of vertebrate time series of population abundance. Low-dimensional (simple) models performed well overall, but more complex models did slightly better when applied to time series of cyclic species (e.g. salmon).",,,,"Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014; Collen, Ben/F-2543-2016; Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019","Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Collen, Ben/0000-0003-2564-4243; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010","National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (Santa Barbara, CA, USA)","We are extremely grateful for all of the hard work by the many researchers who assembled, checked, or continue to maintain the databases used in our analysis.

This study provides a framework to accomplish this task in salmon-bearing streams of the northwestern United States, where land-use-related reductions in riparian shading have caused changes in stream thermal regimes, and additional warming from projected climate change may result in significant losses of coldwater fish habitat over the next century. Predatory, nonnative smallmouth bass have also been introduced into many northwestern streams, and their range is likely to expand as streams warm, presenting an additional challenge to the persistence of threatened Pacific salmon. The goal of this work was to forecast the interactive effects of climate change, riparian management, and nonnative species on stream-rearing salmon and to evaluate the capacity of restoration to mitigate these effects. We intersected downscaled global climate forecasts with a local-scale water temperature model to predict mid- and end-of-century temperatures in streams in the Columbia River basin. We compared one stream that is thermally impaired due to the loss of riparian vegetation and another that is cooler and has a largely intact riparian corridor. Using the forecasted stream temperatures in conjunction with fish habitat models, we predicted how stream-rearing chinook salmon and bass distributions would change as each stream warmed. In the highly modified stream, end-of-century warming may cause near total loss of chinook salmon-rearing habitat and a complete invasion of the upper watershed by bass. In the less modified stream, bass were thermally restricted from the upstream-most areas. In both systems, temperature increases resulted in higher predicted spatial overlap between stream-rearing chinook salmon and potentially predatory bass in the early summer (two- to fourfold increase) and greater abundance of bass. We found that riparian restoration could prevent the extirpation of chinook salmon from the more altered stream and could also restrict bass from occupying the upper 31 km of salmon-rearing habitat. The proposed methodology and model predictions are critical for prioritizing climate-change adaptation strategies before salmonids are exposed to both warmer water and greater predation risk by nonnative species.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187",U.S. EPA Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program [833834]; Northwest Climate Science Center graduate fellowship; USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science CenterUnited States Geological Survey,"We thank Seth Wenger for providing the downscaled flow forecasts and Marketa Elsner and Guillaume Mauger for providing the downscaled general circulation model products.

However, studies on evolutionary responses to invasive predators are often complicated by the lack of replicate populations differing in coexistence time with the predator, which would allow the determination of how prey traits change during the invasion. The red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii has invaded many freshwater areas worldwide, with negative impacts for native fauna. Here, we examined how coexistence time shapes antipredator responses of the Iberian waterfrog (Pelophylax perezi) to the invasive crayfish by raising tadpoles from five populations differing in historical exposure to P. clarkii (30 years, 20 years, or no coexistence). Tadpoles from non-invaded populations responded to the presence of P. clarkii with behavioral plasticity (reduced activity), whereas long-term invaded populations showed canalized antipredator behavior (constant low activity level). Tadpoles from one of the long-term invaded populations responded to the crayfish with inducible morphological defenses (deeper tails), reflecting the use of both constitutive and inducible antipredator defenses against the exotic predator by this population. Our results suggest that, while naive P. perezi populations responded behaviorally to P. clarkii, the strong predation pressure imposed by the crayfish has induced the evolution of qualitatively different antipredator defenses in populations with longer coexistence time. These responses suggest that strong selection by invasive predators may drive rapid evolutionary change in invaded communities. Examining responses of prey species to biological invasions using multiple populations will help us better forecast the impact of invasive predators in natural communities.",,,,"Nunes, Ana Luisa/U-9122-2019; Orizaola, German/A-5217-2008; Rebelo, Rui/D-7054-2013","Nunes, Ana Luisa/0000-0002-5489-819X; Orizaola, German/0000-0002-6748-966X; Rebelo, Rui/0000-0003-2544-1470","FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [POCI/BIA-BDE/56100/2004, SFRH/BD/29068/2006]; Stiftelsen for Zoologisk Forskning","We thank Bruno Carreira, Rosario Sumares, Joao Nunes, and Sonia Longueira for their help in the laboratory.

Our analysis revealed that 28% of tidal flats existing in the 1980s had disappeared by the late 2000s (1.2% annually).

Recent studies have compared performance curves of species from different climate zones and suggested that tropical species may be more susceptible to climate change than those from temperate environments. However, in other comparisons involving responses to thermal extremes it has been suggested that mid-latitude populations are more susceptible. Using a group of 10 closely related Drosophila species with known tropical or widespread distribution, we undertake a detailed investigation of their growth performance curves and their tolerance to thermal extremes. Thermal sensitivity of life history traits (fecundity, developmental success, and developmental time) and adult heat resistance were similar in tropical and widespread species groups, while widespread species had higher adult cold tolerance under all acclimation regimes. Laboratory measurements of either population growth capacity or acute tolerance to heat and cold extremes were compared to daily air temperature under current (2002-2007) and future (2100) conditions to investigate if these traits could explain current distributions and, therefore, also forecast future effects of climate change. Life history traits examining the thermal sensitivity of population growth proved to be a poor predictor of current species distributions. In contrast, we validate that adult tolerance to thermal extremes provides a good correlate of current distributions. Thus, in their current distribution range, most of the examined species experience heat exposure close to, but rarely above, the functional heat resistance limit. Similarly, adult functional cold resistance proved a good predictor of species distribution in cooler climates. When using the species' functional tolerance limits under a global warming scenario, we find that both tropical and widespread Drosophila species will face a similar proportional reduction in distribution range under future warming.",,,,"Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017; Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551",Danish Council for Independent Research | Natural SciencesDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF); Science Industry Endowment Fund; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,We thank Torsten N.

To reliably predict at-risk species we need to know which species are currently responding, which are not, and what traits are mediating the responses. For mammals, we have yet to identify overarching physiological, behavioral, or biogeographic traits determining species' responses to climate change, but they must exist. To date, 73 mammal species in North America and eight additional species worldwide have been assessed for responses to climate change, including local extirpations, range contractions and shifts, decreased abundance, phenological shifts, morphological or genetic changes. Only 52% of those species have responded as expected, 7% responded opposite to expectations, and the remaining 41% have not responded. Which mammals are and are not responding to climate change is mediated predominantly by body size and activity times (phylogenetic multivariate logistic regressions, P<0.0001). Large mammals respond more, for example, an elk is 27 times more likely to respond to climate change than a shrew. Obligate diurnal and nocturnal mammals are more than twice as likely to respond as mammals with flexible activity times (P<0.0001). Among the other traits examined, species with higher latitudinal and elevational ranges were more likely to respond to climate change in some analyses, whereas hibernation, heterothermy, burrowing, nesting, and study location did not influence responses. These results indicate that some mammal species can behaviorally escape climate change whereas others cannot, analogous to paleontology's climate sheltering hypothesis. Including body size and activity flexibility traits into future extinction risk forecasts should substantially improve their predictive utility for conservation and management.",,,,"King, Sarah R.

Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence-absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence-absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 032 (SE +/- 012) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence-absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 005 (SE +/- 001) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence-absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence-absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence-absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.",,,,"Willis, Stephen/F-8503-2015; Stephens, Philip/B-8397-2008","Willis, Stephen/0000-0002-8656-5808; Stephens, Philip/0000-0001-5849-788X; Gregory, Richard/0000-0002-7419-5053",National Environment Research Council (NERC)NERC Natural Environment Research Council; British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) CASE partnership; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [1080221],"CH is funded by a National Environment Research Council (NERC) training grant with a British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) CASE partnership.

We explicitly quantified uncertainties in the models and estimated the future environmental suitability with discounted uncertainty. We analysed the predicted future suitability for protected versus unprotected occurrence cells. Results In this first forecast of the future of multiple spider species in the face of environmental changes, we showed that environmental changes could be confidently predicted to have serious impacts on all the studied species, with significant range contractions and expansions within a relatively short time-scale (up to 2050). We predicted that for seven of the 10 species, the current network of protected areas will conserve at least one occurrence cell in suitable conditions in the future. However, we showed that there is considerable room for improvement. Main conclusions This study illustrated how SDMs could be applied to a conservation programme for an understudied taxon such as spiders, in spite of significant uncertainties in their predictions.

The terrain is represented by a Digital Terrain Model, where the local conditions are represented by a light availability model, climate data, soil properties, and a combination of a water flow model and average annual rainfall data. Each tree in our model is associated with its immediate circular ecological neighbourhood and is treated individually from the seedling stage through to its decay. Each year, tree heights, actual vigour, and neighbourhood radii were calculated. When two radii intersected, the vigour of both trees was compared. The weaker of the two became dominated, leading to stress-related mortality. When a tree reached the adult stage, it produced seeds that established new seedlings that competed for light and nutrition. To start the simulation, the initial amount of seed was planted on bare ground. It was possible to monitor the succession phases either visually or statistically. 3D tree models were used to visualize a tree at any age, generating realistic landscape images useful for demonstrating long-term changes in the cultural landscape to non-experts. The results were compared with those from previous field studies in various areas of Slovenia. Apart from predicting landscape changes after farmland abandonment, the model can be used for forecasting the regeneration process after clearcutting or natural disasters. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Prediction relies on models that describe our understanding of the major processes that underlie system dynamics and data about these processes and the present state of ecosystems. Prediction becomes more effective when models are well informed by data. A technological revolution in the capacity to collect data now provides very different opportunities to test hypotheses and project future dynamics than when many standard statistical tests were first developed. Data assimilation is an emerging statistical approach to combine models with data in a rigorous way to constrain model parameters and system states, identify model error, and improve ecological prediction. In this paper, we illustrate how data assimilation can improve ecological prediction to support decision-making by reviewing applications of data assimilation across four different research fields: (1) emerging infectious disease, (2) fisheries, (3) fire, and (4) the terrestrial carbon cycle. Across these fields, data assimilation substantially improves prediction accuracy, highlighting its important role in enabling predictive ecology. Data assimilation with regional and global models faces major challenges, such as the large number of parameters to be estimated, high computational demands, the need to integrate multiple and heterogeneous data sets, and complex social-ecological interactions. Nevertheless, data assimilation provides an important statistical approach that has great potential to enhance the predictive capacity of ecological models in a changing climate.",,,,"Keenan, Trevor F./B-2744-2010; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009","Keenan, Trevor F./0000-0002-3347-0258; Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0840964, EF 0938795]; ""One Hundred Talent"" award from Chinese Academy of Sciences","We acknowledge Dr. Henry W.

However, connectivity continues to be simulated using overly simple distance-based dispersal models with little consideration of how the individual behaviour of dispersing organisms interacts with landscape structure (functional connectivity). Here, we link an individual-based model to a niche-population model to test the implications of this omission. We apply this novel approach to a turtle species inhabiting wetlands which are patchily distributed across a tropical savannah, and whose persistence is threatened by two important synergistic drivers of global change: predation by invasive species and over-exploitation. We show that projections of local range dynamics in this study system change substantially when functional connectivity is modelled explicitly. Accounting for functional connectivity in model simulations causes the estimate of extinction risk to increase, and predictions of range contraction to slow. We conclude that models of range dynamics that simulate functional connectivity can reduce an important source of bias in predictions of shifts in species distributions and abundances, especially for organisms whose dispersal behaviours are strongly affected by landscape structure.",,,,"Brook, Barry/G-2686-2011; Fordham, Damien/E-9255-2013","Brook, Barry/0000-0002-2491-1517; Fordham, Damien/0000-0003-2137-5592","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP1096427, FT100100200, FS110200051]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1146198]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)United States Environmental Protection Agency","Australian Research Council supported D.A.F., B.W.B. and N.C.

These include forecasting species and community response to environmental change, inferring dispersal ecology, revealing cryptic mating, quantifying past population dynamics, assessing in situ management options and monitoring neutral and adaptive biodiversity change. Advances in population demographic-genetic simulation software, especially with respect to individual life history, landscapes and genetic processes, are transforming and expanding the ways that molecular data can be used. The aim of this review is to explain the roles that such software can play in molecular ecology studies (whether as a principal component or a supporting function) so that researchers can decide whether, when and precisely how simulations can be incorporated into their work. First, I use seven case studies to demonstrate how simulations are employed, their specific advantage/necessity and what alternative or complementary (nonsimulation) approaches are available. I also explain how simulations can be integrated with existing spatial, environmental, historical and genetic data sets. I next describe simulation features that may be of interest to molecular ecologists, such as spatial and behavioural considerations and species' interactions, to provide guidance on how particular simulation capabilities can serve particular needs. Lastly, I discuss the prospect of simulation software in emerging challenges (climate change, biodiversity monitoring, population exploitation) and opportunities (genomics, ancient DNA), in order to emphasize that the scope of simulation-based work is expanding. I also suggest practical considerations, priorities and elements of best practice. This should accelerate the uptake of simulation approaches and firmly embed them as a versatile tool in the molecular ecologist's toolbox.",,,,"Peng, Bo/A-6920-2009","Peng, Bo/0000-0001-8225-2284","European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [FP7-ENV-2009-1-244250]; University of Ferrara, Italy; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Homeland SecurityUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS); US Department of Agriculture through NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0832858, DBI-1300426]; The University of Tennessee, Knoxville","I thank several anonymous reviewers, Frederic Guillaume, Oscar Gaggiotti, Giorgio Bertorelle, Peter Galbusera, Carles Vila, Michael Bruford, Allan Strand and Gernot Segelbacher for suggestions and encouragement.

In coastal ecosystems, the relative effects of aspects of global climate change (e.g. CO2 concentrations) and localized stressors (e.g. eutrophication), in combination, have received limited attention. Using a long-term (11month) field experiment, we examine how epiphyte assemblages in a tropical seagrass meadow respond to factorial manipulations of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) and nutrient enrichment. In situ CO2(aq) manipulations were conducted using clear, open-top chambers, which replicated carbonate parameter forecasts for the year 2100. Nutrient enrichment consisted of monthly additions of slow-release fertilizer, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), to the sediments at rates equivalent to theoretical maximum rates of anthropogenic loading within the region (1.54gNm(-2)d(-1) and 0.24gPm(-2)d(-1)). Epiphyte community structure was assessed on a seasonal basis and revealed declines in the abundance of coralline algae, along with increases in filamentous algae under elevated CO2(aq). Surprisingly, nutrient enrichment had no effect on epiphyte community structure or overall epiphyte loading. Interactions between CO2(aq) and nutrient enrichment were not detected. Furthermore, CO2(aq)-mediated responses in the epiphyte community displayed strong seasonality, suggesting that climate change studies in variable environments should be conducted over extended time-scales. Synthesis. The observed responses indicate that for certain locations, global stressors such as ocean acidification may take precedence over local eutrophication in altering the community structure of seagrass epiphyte assemblages. Given that nutrient-driven algal overgrowth is commonly cited as a widespread cause of seagrass decline, our findings highlight that alternate climate change forces may exert proximate control over epiphyte community structure.",,,,"Fourqurean, James/B-4606-2008","Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0620409]; Florida International University,"We thank Dr. Patrick Rice and the Florida Keys Community College for logistical support.

Also, we expected alpine zooplankton to respond more strongly than those from warmer montane lakes to increased water temperature. Plankton from two alpine lakes and two montane lakes were incubated in vitro for 30days at 10 or 17 degrees C and with ambient or +80% DOC, which was achieved by concentrating humic substances from each lake via reverse osmosis. Dissolved organic carbon amendments and warming significantly increase particulate C:P under montane, but not alpine conditions. While higher water temperature and DOC separately reduced phytoplankton abundance, together they increased phytoplankton by stimulating uptake of P. Warming stimulated only Daphnia while suppressing the abundance of the calanoid copepod Hesperodiaptomus when they originated from the three coldest lakes. Particulate C:P was positively correlated with Daphnia abundance and negatively correlated with Hesperodiaptomus, probably due to greater P-retention by Daphnia. Our findings highlight the importance of interactions between the ecological effects of higher temperature and increased inputs of terrestrial organic matter to forecasts of the net impact of global warming on mountain lakes.

One critical, albeit often ignored, limitation of these area-based estimates is their disregard of the ecological context that shapes species distributions. In this study, we estimate species loss using a spatially explicit mechanistic simulation model to evaluate three important aspects of ecological context: coexistence mechanisms (e.g. species sorting, competition-colonization tradeoffs and neutral dynamics), spatial distribution of environmental conditions, and spatial pattern of habitat loss. We found that 1) area-based estimates of extinctions are sensitive to coexistence mechanisms as well as to the pattern of environmental heterogeneity; 2) there is a strong interaction between coexistence mechanisms and the pattern of habitat loss; 3) SARs always yield higher estimates of species loss than do EARs; and 4) SARs and EARs consistently underestimate the realized species loss.

Understanding potential mismatches between environmental data used as inputs to predictive models, and the forecasts of ecological responses that these models generate are particularly difficult when predicting responses to climate change since the assumption of model stationarity in time cannot be tested. In the last four decades, increases in computational capacity (by a factor of a million), and the evolution of new modeling tools, have permitted a corresponding increase in model complexity, in the length of the simulations, and in spatial-temporal resolution. Nevertheless, many predictions of responses such as shifts in range boundaries are often based on coarse spatial and temporal data, for example monthly or yearly averages. Here we model the effects of environmental change on the physiological response of an ecologically and commercially important species of mussel, the fitness of which can have a cascading influence on ecosystem levels. Using a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model integrated with climatic data produced from IPCC-Al B scenarios, we investigated the effect of temporal resolution of physical data on predictions of the growth and reproductive output of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. We ran models using five different temporal scales, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1 h (derived by interpolating between 6 h points), at 5 Italian locations in the Central Mediterranean Sea, for the period ranging from 2006 to 2009. Results from these models were further compared against the results from a DEB model that used hourly environmental data recorded at the five locations as inputs. Model outputs included estimates of life history traits relevant to ecological performance as well as parameters related to Darwinian fitness. Results showed that predictions of maximum theoretical shell length were similar regardless of which source of environmental data was used. However, while the DEB model using 1-h modeled data produced predictions of reproductive output very similar to those obtained using recorded (hourly) environmental data from the same time period, results using coarser resolution modeled data greatly underestimated reproductive output. Thus, the use of modeled weather data can yield predictions similar to those generated from measured data, but only when data are provided at relatively high frequency. Our results suggest that metrics of model skill can diverge significantly when physical outputs of climate models are applied to biological questions, and that the temporal resolution of environmental data can strongly alter predictions of biological responses to environmental change.

We then combined the results of all five models into an ensemble-forecasting model to facilitate a more robust prediction. This model indicated the existence of 7,865 km(2) of suitable habitat for the sambar deer. Distance from roads and elevation were identified as the most important environmental variables for habitat suitability, and deer preferred areas far from roads and >1,500 m altitude. The results predicted that suitable deer habitat is mainly located in Taiwan's Central Mountain Range and Xue Mountain Range, with c. 70% of this suitable habitat in protected areas.

Assessing the vulnerabilities of seabirds to maritime hazards requires an understanding of their species distribution, and a means for combining this information across groups. Using at-sea survey data gathered as part of a regional monitoring program, an efficient framework for integrating multi-species data was developed. Survey data was incorporated within a distance sampling framework to generate bias-corrected seabird densities for an area of over 730,000 km(2) size, which were used to construct multiple species distribution models (SDMs). The structural difficulties associated with sampling sparsely distributed individuals that also occur in large, localized concentrations led to the use of three modelling techniques potentially well suited for this type of data: negative binomial, ''hurdle'', and random forest methods. Predicted abundances were combined to produce an ensemble forecast, which met or exceeded the accuracy of predictions from the individual models. Multi-species potential sensitivity maps were developed to identify core areas, confirming the general importance of physiographic features such as the shelf break and bathymetry. Distribution was also seasonally influenced, with spring and winter standing out as periods of peak importance. When combined with an oil pollution layer derived from aerial surveillance, vulnerability was highest in the vicinity of major ports (e.g., Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia). However, the vulnerability map also indicated lower but widespread levels of oiling risk throughout the shelf, presumably associated with persistently high levels of shipping traffic and ongoing petroleum extraction and exploration.

We tested a suite of climatic and habitat metrics as predictors of American pika (Ochotona princeps) relative population density in the Southern Rocky Mountains, USA. Population density was indexed as the density of pika latrine sites. Negative binomial regression and AIC(c) showed that the best predictors of pika latrine density were patch area followed by two measures of vegetation quality: the diversity and relative cover of forbs. In contrast with previous studies of habitat occupancy in the Southern Rockies, climatic factors were not among the top predictors of latrine density.

We emphasize the influence of three methodological choices: (1) the choice of the currency in which the abundance of each species is measured, i.e. numbers of individuals or biomass; (2) the rules used to define the species assemblage under focus, i.e. broad communities or refined ecological guilds; and (3) the influence of rare over common species in the biodiversity measure. Location The effects of these choices are investigated using an exhaustive dataset on the fish fauna of the continental shelf of the Barents Sea. Methods We conducted an analysis of 220 models resulting from all possible combinations of the three methodological choices. For each, we evaluated the predictive performance through an iterative cross-validation process. Results All methodological choices we investigated strongly affected the predictive performance of MEMs. High predictive performances were obtained when using biomass instead of numbers of individuals, when focusing on narrow ecological guilds composed of species sharing the same ecological traits and when using diversity measures that give high weight to rare species. Main conclusions We recommend that future projections of biodiversity pay more attention to abundance currency, ecological homogeneity of focal species assemblages and the diversity metric used, and systematically investigate these methodological choices prior to producing biodiversity forecasts. Splitting a whole set of species into ecological guilds appears to be a promising practice, leading to a selected set of MEMs with high predictive performances and more detailed forecasts on the fate of diversity.",,,,"Planque, Benjamin/D-2729-2013","Planque, Benjamin/0000-0002-0557-7410; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794",BarEcoRe (NFR) [200796/41],"First, we wish to thank all the participants in the joint Russian-Norwegian ecosystem survey.

This approach has met with mixed success, due to unforeseen impacts caused by human or other factors. Some of these impacts could potentially be mitigated through the use of anticipatory modeling coupled with appropriate management strategies prior to release. As part of an ongoing restoration program, we evaluated a portion of the former range of the tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) in the Central Valley of California for potential reintroduction of a free-ranging herd. We used a new spatially explicit population model (HexSim) to analyze four different elk release scenarios. Each scenario corresponded to a different release location, and the model was used to compare simulated elk movement and population dynamics 25 years into the future. We also used HexSim to identify likely locations of human-elk conflict. Population forecasts after the 25-year period were highest (mean female population size of 169.6 per iteration) and potentially harmful barrier interactions were lowest (mean 8.6 per iteration) at the East Bear Creek site. These results indicate the East Bear Creek site release scenario as the most likely to result in a successful elk reintroduction, producing the most elk and generating the fewest human conflicts.

First, realistic global change scenarios involve multiple drivers of environmental change that can interact with one another to produce non-additive effects. Second, in addition to these direct effects, global change drivers can indirectly affect plants by modifying species interactions. In order to tackle both of these challenges, we propose a novel population modeling approach, requiring only measurements of abundance and climate over time. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, we model population dynamics of eight abundant plant species in a multifactorial global change experiment in alpine tundra where we manipulated nitrogen, precipitation, and temperature over 7years. We test whether indirect and interactive effects are important to population dynamics and whether explicitly incorporating species interactions can change predictions when models are forecast under future climate change scenarios. For three of the eight species, population dynamics were best explained by direct effect models, for one species neither direct nor indirect effects were important, and for the other four species indirect effects mattered. Overall, global change had negative effects on species population growth, although species responded to different global change drivers, and single-factor effects were slightly more common than interactive direct effects. When the fitted population dynamic models were extrapolated under changing climatic conditions to the end of the century, forecasts of community dynamics and diversity loss were largely similar using direct effect models that do not explicitly incorporate species interactions or best-fit models; however, inclusion of species interactions was important in refining the predictions for two of the species. The modeling approach proposed here is a powerful way of analyzing readily available datasets which should be added to our toolbox to tease apart complex drivers of global change.",,,,"Farrer, Emily/AAD-4639-2020; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Farrer, Emily/0000-0001-8003-8831; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; Knape, Jonas/0000-0002-8012-5131",Niwot Ridge LTER [DEB-1027341]; Andrew W.

We developed flexible Bayesian survival regression models to assess a 29-year, individual-level time series of flowering phenology from four taxa of Japanese cherry trees (Prunus spachiana, Prunusxyedoensis, Prunus jamasakura, and Prunus lannesiana), from the Tama Forest Cherry Preservation Garden in Hachioji, Japan. Our modeling framework used time-varying (chill and heat units) and time-invariant (slope, aspect, and elevation) factors. We found limited differences among taxa in sensitivity to chill, but earlier flowering taxa, such as P. spachiana, were more sensitive to heat than later flowering taxa, such as P. lannesiana. Using an ensemble of three downscaled regional climate models under the A1B emissions scenario, we projected shifts in flowering timing by 2100. Projections suggest that each taxa will flower about 30days earlier on average by 2100 with 2-6days greater uncertainty around the species mean flowering date. Dramatic shifts in the flowering times of cherry trees may have implications for economically important cultural festivals in Japan and East Asia. The survival models used here provide a mechanistic modeling approach and are broadly applicable to any time-to-event phenological data, such as plant leafing, bird arrival time, and insect emergence. The ability to explicitly quantify uncertainty, examine phenological responses on a fine time scale, and incorporate conditions leading up to an event may provide future insight into phenologically driven changes in carbon balance and ecological mismatches of plants and pollinators in natural populations and horticultural crops.",,,,"Wilson, Adam/C-6731-2009","Wilson, Adam/0000-0003-3362-7806",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0842465],"Support for this collaborative project was provided by the US National Science Foundation (DEB 0842465) to J.A.S., R.B.P., and Ines Ibanez.

We argue that many ecologically damaging invaders are characterised by their more efficient use of resources. Consequently, comparison of the classical 'functional response' (relationship between resource use and availability) between invasive and trophically analogous native species may allow prediction of invader ecological impact. We review the utility of species trait comparisons and the history and context of the use of functional responses in invasion ecology, then present our framework for the use of comparative functional responses. We show that functional response analyses, by describing the resource use of species over a range of resource availabilities, avoids many pitfalls of 'snapshot' assessments of resource use. Our framework demonstrates how comparisons of invader and native functional responses, within and between Type II and III functional responses, allow testing of the likely population-level outcomes of invasions for affected species. Furthermore, we describe how recent studies support the predictive capacity of this method; for example, the invasive 'bloody red shrimp' Hemimysis anomala shows higher Type II functional responses than native mysids and this corroborates, and could have predicted, actual invader impacts in the field. The comparative functional response method can also be used to examine differences in the impact of two or more invaders, two or more populations of the same invader, and the abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. parasitism) context-dependencies of invader impacts. Our framework may also address the previous lack of rigour in testing major hypotheses in invasion ecology, such as the 'enemy release' and 'biotic resistance' hypotheses, as our approach explicitly considers demographic consequences for impacted resources, such as native and invasive prey species. We also identify potential challenges in the application of comparative functional responses in invasion ecology. These include incorporation of numerical responses, multiple predator effects and trait-mediated indirect interactions, replacement versus non-replacement study designs and the inclusion of functional responses in risk assessment frameworks. In future, the generation of sufficient case studies for a meta-analysis could test the overall hypothesis that comparative functional responses can indeed predict invasive species impacts.",,,,"Jeschke, Jonathan M/A-2707-2008; Farnsworth, Keith/B-5546-2008; Robinson, Tamara B/I-1806-2019; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008; Weyl, Olaf/B-8996-2009; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Jeschke, Jonathan M/0000-0003-3328-4217; Robinson, Tamara B/0000-0001-5515-1445; Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054; Kumschick, Sabrina/0000-0001-8034-5831; Paterson, Rachel/0000-0003-0773-0447; Farnsworth, Keith/0000-0001-8025-1114; Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077","Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; Natural Environment Research Council UKNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G01521X/1]; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (Stellenbosch University, South Africa); National Research Foundation (South Africa)National Research Foundation - South Africa [85417]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [JE 288/4-1]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Drakenstein Trust; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G015201/1, NE/G01521X/1]","We thank the Leverhulme Trust, Natural Environment Research Council UK (grant NE/G01521X/1), the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (Stellenbosch University, South Africa), the National Research Foundation (South Africa, grant 85417), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant JE 288/4-1) for funding.

Over the last 30years, the lake has suffered from serious cyanobacterial blooms that deteriorate drinking water quality and in some cases have led to serious water supply crises. For local government to respond quickly to the onset of a cyanobacterial bloom, it is crucial to forecast the probability, areas, and intensity of the bloom. In this paper, an attempt to forecast the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu is documented. The forecast is based on a short-term cyanobacterial bloom forecasting numerical model containing a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-algal biomass model and a probability of bloom occurrence forecasting model. The former model was based on solving the governing equations of the cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in shallow lakes. Unstructured mesh division was used to fit the irregular coastal boundaries where harmful blooms often happened. The finite volume method discretized the governing equations, and the conservation laws were preserved. To drive the model, the initial algae chlorophyll a concentrations were obtained from 18 automatic monitoring buoys and boat survey measurements. By combining calculation and prediction of the hydrological and meteorologic scenarios over the ensuing 3days, the dynamic distributions of the algae concentration scenarios in Lake Taihu were simulated. Blooming probabilities were then predicted by a forecast model that included the weight of algal biomass, wind velocity, and weather condition. The model was applied to predict the occurrences of the algae blooms of the next 3days in Lake Taihu during April to September in 2009 and 2010. Independent evaluations from remote sensing images and boat survey data showed that the accuracy of these bloom forecasts was more than 80%.

We show that accurate estimates require ways to connect discrete observations of changing tree status (e.g., pre- vs. post budbreak) with continuous responses to fluctuating temperatures. By coherently synthesizing discrete observations with continuous responses to temperature variation, we accurately quantify how increasing temperature variation accelerates onset of growth. Application to warming experiments at two latitudes demonstrates that maximum responses to warming are concentrated in late winter, weeks ahead of the main budbreak period. Given that warming will not occur uniformly over the year, knowledge of when temperature variation has the most impact can guide prediction. Responses are large and heterogeneous, yet predictable.

Tremendous efforts have been made to develop ever more sophisticated species distribution models to provide forecasts for the future of biodiversity. All these models rely on species occurrence data, either for calibration or validation. Here we evaluate (i) whether distribution data diverge among widely used sources, for supposedly well-known taxa, and (ii) to what extent these divergences affect species distribution models. Location Europe (as an example). Methods We compared the distribution maps of 21 of the most common European trees, according to four large-scale, putatively reliable sources of distribution data. For each species, we compared the outputs of correlative species distribution models built using occurrence data from each of these sources of data. We also investigated how discrepancies in large-scale occurrence data affected the validation scores of two process-based tree distribution models. Results Maps of tree occurrence diverged in 8-74% of the forested area, depending on species. These discrepancies affected projections of niche models: for example, 22-75% of the area projected as suitable by at least one model generated using one source of data was not projected as such by all other models. For most species, this proportion increased under scenarios of climate change, whatever the model used. To a lesser extent, uncertainties on current species distributions also affect the validation score of process-based distribution models. Main conclusions Reliable, widely used sources of occurrence data strongly diverge even for well-known taxa - the most common European trees. Scientists and stakeholders should acknowledge this gap in knowledge, since accurate data are a prerequisite to providing stakeholders with robust forecasts on biodiversity.

We also used a historical dataset to compare historical and recent habitat suitability predictions for forecasting variations in species' responses to regional climate warming. LocationThe Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe). MethodsDuring 2007-09 we sampled bumblebees in 37 localities and developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict species' occurrence and abundance in relation to environmental variables. We extracted independent variables at different spatial scales for each locality, based on topoclimatic (slope, temperature and rainfall patterns) and land-cover (habitat configuration and composition) variables. We also used historical (1988-89) bumblebee data (23 localities) to both calibrate recent distribution models and determine the current environmental factors underlying the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming (0.8 degrees C) over two decades. ResultsOccurrence and abundance patterns of species were best predicted by models combining topoclimatic and land-cover variables. Our findings revealed three groups of species, distinguished on the basis of the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming: one comprising six species with climate-based tracking behaviour, a second with three species tracking suitable landscape composition and configuration regardless of climatic conditions, and a third comprising one species showing no apparent tracking behaviour. Main conclusionsTopoclimate and land cover determined the occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee species in mountainous landscapes, even at fine spatial extents. Both environmental variables, however, differentially influenced bumblebees, thereby providing relevant clues for determining the current environmental factors underlying species' distributions and their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore suggest that determining habitat suitability can be used as a baseline approach for understanding species-specific responses to climate warming and for developing vulnerability assessments for conservation-focused management planning.",,,,"Javier Rodriguez-Perez, Ph.D. Biology/C-9773-2009; Herrera, Jose M./L-7432-2013","Javier Rodriguez-Perez, Ph.D. Biology/0000-0002-1292-9090; Herrera, Jose M./0000-0001-7968-3438","Regional Government of Asturias by FICYT grant [BP08-047]; Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2009-11302, CGL2011-28430]",We would like to thank Amalia Segura for helping in the field.

Sea ice algae in areas cleared of snow was compared with control areas, using imaging variable fluorescence of photosystem II in intact, unthawed ice sections. The study coincided with the onset of spring growth of ice algae, mainly an increase in two pennate diatoms (Achnanthes taeniata and Navicula directa), as temperature increased and ice thickness and brine volume stabilized. The increase in biomass was accompanied by an increase in minimum variable fluorescence (F (o)) and the maximum quantum yield of PSII (F (v) /F (m)) and filling of brine channels with fluorescing cells. In contrast, in the minus snow area, PAR transmittance increased sixfold and there was an exponential decrease in chl-a and no increase in F (o), and the area of fluorescing biomass declined to become undetectable.

This intensification is forecast to occur mostly in subtropical regions, where warm and humid conditions can promote high N2O losses from cropped soils. To secure high crop production without exacerbating N20 emissions, new nitrogen (N) fertiliser management strategies are necessary. This one-year study evaluated the efficacy of a nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate DMPP) and different N fertiliser rates to reduce N2O emissions in a wheat-maize rotation in subtropical Australia. Annual N2O emissions were monitored using a fully automated greenhouse gas measuring system. Four treatments were fertilized with different rates of urea, including a control (40 kg-N ha(-1) year(-1)), a conventional N fertiliser rate adjusted on estimated residual soil N (120 kg-N ha-1 year-1), a conventional N fertiliser rate (240 kg-N ha-1 year-1) and a conventional N fertiliser rate (240 kg-N ha-1 year-1) with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) applied at top dressing. The maize season was by far the main contributor to annual N2O emissions due to the high soil moisture and temperature conditions, as well as the elevated N rates applied. Annual N2O emissions in the four treatments aMounted to 0.49, 0.84, 2.02 and 0.74 kg N2O N ha-1 year-1, respectively, and corresponded to emission factors of 0.29%, 0.39%, 0.69% and 0.16% of total N applied. Halving the annual conventional N fertiliser rate in the adjusted N treatment led to N2O emissions comparable to the DMPP treatment but extensively penalised maize yield. The application of DMPP produced a significant reduction in N2O emissions only in the maize season. The use of DMPP with urea at the conventional N rate reduced annual N2O emissions by more than 60% but did not affect crop yields. The results of this study indicate that: (i) future strategies aimed at securing subtropical cereal production without increasing N2O emissions should focus on the fertilisation of the summer crop; (ii) adjusting conventional N fertiliser rates on estimated residual soil N is an effective practice to reduce N2O emissions but can lead to substantial yield losses if the residual soil N is not assessed correctly; (iii) the application of DMPP is a feasible strategy to reduce annual N2O emissions from sub-tropical wheat-maize rotations. However, at the N rates tested in this study DMPP urea did not increase crop yields, making it impossible to recoup extra costs associated with this fertiliser. The findings of this study will support farmers and policy makers to define effective fertilisation strategies to reduce N2O emissions from subtropical cereal cropping systems while maintaining high crop productivity. More research is needed to assess the use of DMPP urea in terms of reducing conventional N fertiliser rates and subsequently enable a decrease of fertilisation costs and a further abatement of fertiliser-induced N2O emissions.

Conflict between people and wildlife results when migrating animals transmit disease to livestock, damage property, and threaten human safety. Mitigating this conflict requires understanding the forces that shape migration patterns. Bison Bos bison migrating from Yellowstone National Park into the state of Montana during winter and spring concern ranchers on lands surrounding the park because bison can transmit brucellosis (Brucella abortus) to cattle. Migrations have been constrained, with bison being lethally removed or moved back into the park. We developed a state-space model to support decisions on bison management aimed at mitigating conflict with landowners outside the park. The model integrated recent GPS observations with 22 years (1990-2012) of aerial counts to forecast monthly distributions and identify factors driving migration. Wintering areas were located along decreasing elevation gradients, and bison accumulated in wintering areas prior to moving to areas progressively lower in elevation. Bison movements were affected by time since the onset of snowpack, snowpack magnitude, standing crop, and herd size. Migration pathways were increasingly used over time, suggesting that experience or learning influenced movements. To support adaptive management of Yellowstone bison, we forecast future movements to evaluate alternatives. Our approach of developing models capable of making explicit probabilistic forecasts of large herbivore movements and seasonal distributions is applicable to managing the migratory movements of large herbivores worldwide. These forecasts allow managers to develop and refine strategies in advance, and promote sound decision-making that reduces conflict as migratory animals come into contact with people.",,,,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016","Hoeting, Jennifer/0000-0003-0414-0193",,,,,13,13,1,129,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

This study combines coastal bathymetry and elevation models to develop a continuous topographic model covering coastal areas on a large geographical scale, and predicts the areal change in five habitats important to numerous breeding and migrating birds. Our model indicates considerable declines in coastal habitats as a result of coastal squeeze, and reveals major conservation concerns regarding future preservation of essential waterbird habitats. In our study area this will directly influence seven species of herbivorous waterbirds occurring at internationally important numbers, and a total of 41 species of coastal birds protected under the EU Birds Directive, many of which are currently designated as having an unfavourable conservation status. Declines in coastal habitats will also affect invertebrates and fish, and through effects on food webs have an even wider ecological implication. These findings highlight the need of focused coastal management, and illustrate the cost of uncritically protecting human agricultural interests while preventing natural dynamics of the coastal zone. Our analysis indicate that pulling down existing sea walls will reduce the loss by 37-65% dependent on habitat type, but that complete compensation is unlikely in our study area due to local topography. Managed retreat of coastlines might be an efficient solution to counteract the effects of coastal squeeze, but the time and interests associated with implementation of such mitigation measures imply that the time for action is now.

Although the discipline of landscape genetics assesses the influence of landscape elements on gene flow, no studies have yet used landscape-genetic models to predict gene flow resulting from landscape change. A species that has already been severely affected by landscape change is the large marsh grasshopper (Stethophyma grossum), which inhabits moist areas in fragmented agricultural landscapes in Switzerland. From transects drawn between all population pairs within maximum dispersal distance (<3 km), we calculated several measures of landscape composition as well as some measures of habitat configuration. Additionally, a complete sampling of all populations in our study area allowed incorporating measures of population topology. These measures together with the landscape metrics formed the predictor variables in linear models with gene flow as response variable (F-ST and mean pairwise assignment probability). With a modified leave-one-out cross-validation approach, we selected the model with the highest predictive accuracy. With this model, we predicted gene flow under several landscape-change scenarios, which simulated construction, rezoning or restoration projects, and the establishment of a new population. For some landscape-change scenarios, significant increase or decrease in gene flow was predicted, while for others little change was forecast. Furthermore, we found that the measures of population topology strongly increase model fit in landscape genetic analysis.

The effects of climate change are particularly evident in the mountainous areas of southwestern China that support the last remaining populations of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). However, very few studies to date have assessed the likely impact of climate change on the distribution and abundance of giant panda habitat. In this paper, we developed a mechanistic model that uses climatic variables (rather than biotic variables) to (i) examine how variation in landscape scale climate influences the spatial distribution of panda habitat in China's Qinling Mountains, and (ii) evaluate how the distribution and extent of panda habitat will change in the future under forecast climate change scenarios. We found that there was substantial variation in temperature throughout the study area that correlated with variation in altitude. Under climate change scenarios, the future climate in this region (during the period 2070-2100) would be far warmer and wetter than the current climate (for the period 1990-2007). Our model results revealed that this predicted climate change could reduce the extent of a suitable habitat for giant pandas by up to 62% (under IPCC SRES A2 scenarios; and 37% under IPCC SRES B2 scenarios). We also showed that as a result of this predicted climate change, the minimum elevation of panda habitat would rise by 500 m. Accordingly, our model showed that on the basis of predicted climate change, a new suitable giant panda habitat would likely become available in areas further north of their current range (at higher latitudes, in the northwest part of the study region). Finally, and most importantly, we showed that the established network of nature reserves within this study region does not adequately protect the current distribution of suitable panda habitat, nor will it protect suitable panda habitat in the future.

The Biodiversity Forecasting Tool (BFT) helps answer three important questions relating to regional biodiversity persistence: 'how much' biodiversity can persist for a given land-management scenario; 'what' habitats to focus conservation effort on; and 'where' in the landscape to undertake conservation action. The tool integrates fine-scaled variability in vegetation composition and structure with spatial context, which is critical for ensuring the viability of populations. Thus, a raster data framework is employed which deems each location or gridcell in a landscape as contributing to biodiversity benefits to various degrees. At its simplest, just two spatial inputs, vegetation community types and vegetation condition, are needed. Drawing on, as a case-study, a broad-scale biodiversity assessment for NSW, Australia, this paper reports on the successful application of the BFT tool for a variety of functions ranging from interactive scenario evaluation through to conservation benefits mapping.

Our understanding of competition's importance at broader scales is less resolved and mainly based on static species distribution maps. Here, we bridge this gap by examining the joint occupancy dynamics of an invading species (Barred Owl, Strix varia) and a resident species (Northern Spotted Owl, Strix occidentalis caurina) in a 1000-km(2) study area over a 22-year period. Past studies of these competitors have focused on the dynamics of one species at a time, hindering efforts to parse out the roles of habitat and competition and to forecast the future of the resident species. In addition, while these studies accounted for the imperfect detection of the focal species, no multi-season analysis of these species has accounted for the imperfect detection of the secondary species, potentially biasing inference. We analyzed survey data using models that combine the general multistate-multi-season occupancy modeling framework with autologistic modeling, allowing us to account for important aspects of our study system. We found that local extinction probability increases for each species when the other is present; however, the effect of the invader on the resident is greater. Although the species prefer different habitats, these habitats are highly correlated at the patch scale, and the impacts of invader on the resident are greatest in patches that would otherwise be optimal. As a consequence, competition leads to a weaker relationship between habitat and Northern Spotted Owl occupancy. Colonization and extinction rates of the invader are closely related to neighborhood occupancy, and over the first half of the study the availability of colonists limited the rate of population growth. Competition is likely to exclude the resident species, both through its immediate effects on local extinction and by indirectly lowering colonization rates as Northern Spotted Owl occupancy declines. Our analysis suggests that dispersal limitation affects both the invasion dynamics and the scale at which the effects of competition are observed. We also provide predictions regarding the potential costs and benefits of managing Barred Owl populations at different target levels.",,,,"Nichols, James/AAG-1500-2019","Yackulic, Charles/0000-0001-9661-0724",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1003221],"Richard Chandler and three anonymous reviewers provided insightful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

This suggests that the U.S. and world supplies of shale oil may be limited.

Two interesting comparisons of the world oil production trend to other regional trends are the former Soviet Union's oil production trend and the U.S. oil production trend. If we compare the current world oil production trend to those previous trends using indexation, then we can get an idea of what may happen to world oil production in the future.

Local-scale expansions and contractions are most likely observable near species range limits, and as trees are long-lived, initial shifts are likely to be detected in the understory regeneration layers. We examined understory relative abundance patterns of naturally regenerated temperate and boreal tree species in two size classes, seedlings and saplings, and across two spatial scales, local stand-scale ecotones (tens of meters) and the regional temperate-boreal transition zone (250 km) in central North America, to explore indications of climate-mediated shifts in regeneration performance. We also tested for the presence of strong environmental gradients across local ecotones that might inhibit species expansion. Results showed that tree regeneration patterns across ecotones varied by species and size class, and varied across the regional summer temperature gradient. Temperate tree species regeneration has established across local ecotones into boreal forest patches and this process was facilitated by warmer temperatures. Conversely, boreal conifer regeneration exhibited negative responses to the regional temperature gradient and only displayed high abundance at the boreal end of local ecotones at cool northern sites. The filtering effects of temperature also increased with individual size for both boreal and temperate understory stems. Observed regeneration patterns and the minor environmental gradients measured across local ecotones failed to support the idea that there were strong barriers to potential temperate tree expansion into boreal forest patches. Detectable responses, consistently in the directions predicted for both temperate and boreal species, indicate that summer temperature is likely an important driver of natural tree regeneration in forests across the temperate-boreal transition zone. Regeneration patterns point toward temperate expansion and reduced but continued boreal presence in the near-future, resulting in local and regional expansions of mixed temperate-boreal forests.",,,,,"Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Frelich, Lee/0000-0002-9052-7070","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR Fellowship ProgramUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. Dept of State Fulbright Program; Center for Forest Ecology, Univ. of Minnesota; Hubachek Wilderness Research Foundation; Dayton-Wilkie Natural History Fund of the Bell Museum of Natural History; Univ. of Minnesota Carolyn Crosby Fellowship","Financial support was provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR Fellowship Program; U.S. Dept of State Fulbright Program; Center for Forest Ecology, Univ. of Minnesota; Hubachek Wilderness Research Foundation; Dayton-Wilkie Natural History Fund of the Bell Museum of Natural History; and Univ. of Minnesota Carolyn Crosby Fellowship.

There exists a clear need for detailed case studies that link mechanisms to spatial dynamics and boundaries because such mechanisms allow us to predict whether climate change is likely to change a species' geographic range and, if so, how abundance in marginal populations compares to the core. The bagworm Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) is a major native pest of cedars, arborvitae, junipers, and other landscape trees throughout much of North America. Across dozens of bagworm populations spread over six degrees of latitude in the American Midwest we find latitudinal declines in fecundity and egg and pupal survivorship as one proceeds toward the northern range boundary. A spatial gradient of bagworm reproductive success emerges, which is associated with a progressive decline in local abundance and an increase in the risk of local population extinction near the species' geographic range boundary. We developed a mathematical model, completely constrained by empirically estimated parameters, to explore the relative roles of reproductive asynchrony and stage-specific survivorship in generating the range limit for this species. We find that overwinter egg mortality is the biggest constraint on bagworm persistence beyond their northern range limit. Overwinter egg mortality is directly related to winter temperatures that fall below the bagworm eggs' physiological limit. This threshold, in conjunction with latitudinal declines in fecundity and pupal survivorship, creates a nonlinear response to climate extremes that sets the geographic boundary and provides a path for predicting northward range expansion under altered climate conditions. Our mechanistic modeling approach demonstrates how species' sensitivity to climate extremes can create population tipping points not reflected in demographic responses to climate means, a distinction that is critical to successful ecological forecasting.",,,,"Calabrese, Justin/B-9131-2012","Calabrese, Justin/0000-0003-0575-6408","U.S. National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF/DMS-0816068, NSF/DMS-1118623, NSF/DMS-1225917]","We thank Matthew Aiello-Lammens and Caroline Wick for reviewing the manuscript.

However, the ability of migrating animals to solve this problem has received limited consideration, even though wind and ocean currents cause the lateral displacement of flyers and swimmers, respectively, particularly during long-distance journeys of 1000s of kilometres. Here, we examine this problem by combining long-distance, open-ocean marine turtle movements (obtained via long-term GPS tracking of sea turtles moving 1000s of km), with a high resolution basin-wide physical ocean model to estimate ocean currents. We provide a robust mathematical framework to demonstrate that, while turtles eventually arrive at their target site, they do not follow the optimum (Zermelo's) route. Even though adult marine turtles regularly complete incredible long-distance migrations, these vertebrates primarily rely on course corrections when entering neritic waters during the final stages of migration.

Novel interactions between previously non-overlapping species may, however, also be mediated by altered plants' responses to herbivore attack. Syndromes of plant defences and tolerance are driven by inherited functional traits, biotic and abiotic conditions, and the geographical and historical contingencies affecting the community. Therefore, understanding climate change-driven herbivore responses and evolution towards a particular plant defence syndrome is key to forecasting species interactions in the near future. In this paper, we first document variations in herbivory, and plant defences along altitudinal gradients that act as natural experiments'. We then use an empirical model to predict how specialist herbivore abundance may shift with respect to elevation in the near future. Our field surveys and field experiment showed a decrease in herbivory with elevation. However, contrary to expectations, our meta-regression analyses showed that plant defences, particularly leaf toughness and flavonoid compounds, tend to be higher at high elevations, while secondary metabolites showed no clear trend with elevation. Based on those results, we discuss how plant communities and species-specific plant defence syndromes will change in response to the climate-driven herbivore colonization of higher altitudes. Particularly, plant from high elevation, due to high protection against abiotic stress may be already ecologically fitted to resist the sudden increase in herbivory pressure that they will likely experience during global change.",,,,"Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015; Rasmann, Sergio/T-5376-2017; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020; Kunstler, Georges/F-9179-2012","Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Rasmann, Sergio/0000-0002-3120-6226; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Kunstler, Georges/0000-0002-2544-1940",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [226299]; Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Program (Demo- traits project)European Union (EU) [299340]; Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione grant [PZ00P3_131956/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research grant [12-126430],"Some of the research reported here was conducted as part of the BACCARA project, which received funding from the European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/ 2007-2013), under grant agreement no. 226299.

Survival will depend on whether or not susceptible organisms can find refuges that buffer extreme conditions. Microhabitats offer different microclimates to those found within the wider ecosystem, but do these microhabitats effectively buffer extreme climate events relative to the physiological requirements of the animals that frequent them? We collected temperature data from four common microhabitats (soil, tree holes, epiphytes, and vegetation) located from the ground to canopy in primary rainforests in the Philippines. Ambient temperatures were monitored from outside of each microhabitat and from the upper forest canopy, which represent our macrohabitat controls. We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of frog and lizard species, which are thermally sensitive and inhabit our microhabitats. Microhabitats reduced mean temperature by 1-2 degrees C and reduced the duration of extreme temperature exposure by 14-31times. Microhabitat temperatures were below the CTmax of inhabitant frogs and lizards, whereas macrohabitats consistently contained lethal temperatures. Microhabitat temperatures increased by 0.11-0.66 degrees C for every 1 degrees C increase in macrohabitat temperature, and this nonuniformity in temperature change influenced our forecasts of vulnerability for animal communities under climate change. Assuming uniform increases of 6 degrees C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 32-fold, whereas under nonuniform increases of 0.66 to 3.96 degrees C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 108-fold. Microhabitats have extraordinary potential to buffer climate and likely reduce mortality during extreme climate events. These results suggest that predicted changes in distribution due to mortality and habitat shifts that are derived from macroclimatic samples and that assume uniform changes in microclimates relative to macroclimates may be overly pessimistic. Nevertheless, even nonuniform temperature increases within buffered microhabitats would still threaten frogs and lizards.",,,,"Edwards, David/AAC-5091-2019; Williams, Stephen E/A-7250-2008; Evans, Theodore/AAC-7497-2020; Evans, Theodore A/A-6020-2008; Scheffers, Brett/L-2585-2014","Williams, Stephen E/0000-0002-2510-7408; Evans, Theodore/0000-0002-0558-3036; Evans, Theodore A/0000-0002-0558-3036; Scheffers, Brett/0000-0003-2423-3821",Singapore International Graduate Award; Wildlife Reserves Singapore Conservation Fund; Australian Government National Environment Research ProgramAustralian Government; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"We thank B.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) is faced with managing a protracted bTB outbreak with shrinking economic resources, its initial control strategies approaching, or having reached, the limits of their effectiveness. Planning tools are needed to project the outbreak's future course and forecast the likely outcomes of proposed controls. We describe development of a spatially explicit, individual-based stochastic simulation model of bTB in Michigan white-tailed deer. We sought to 1) characterize whether eradication of bTB is possible by increasing hunter harvest or via vaccination, and how long it is likely to take to achieve eradication; 2) characterize the effect of concurrent deer baiting; and 3) assess the effect of baiting on the probability of bTB establishment in uninfected areas. Simulations indicated that current MDNR management strategies are unlikely to eradicate bTB from the core outbreak area's deer population within the next 30 years. A 50-100% increase (over current rates) of both antlered and antlerless deer harvest was required to achieve eradication if baiting was occurring, compared to only a 50% increase in harvest required if baiting was eliminated. Vaccination strategies required frequent application and high exposure rates (>90%) to achieve eradication, which baiting delayed. Simulations indicated that if bTB was eradicated from the core outbreak area, a single infected deer introduced into the area would be 8 times more likely to re-establish bTB if baiting was occurring. The ability to forecast likely outcomes of disease management can be critical for wildlife managers to assess whether specific strategies are likely to be successful. Because current policy appears unlikely to achieve the stated goal of eradicating bTB from Michigan in the foreseeable future, reorienting the bTB program from eradication to controlling geographic spread and transmission to cattle may be more realistic goals. Spatial models such as ours are ideally suited to investigating spatial heterogeneity of disease transmission, and how transmission is influenced by aggregating factors such as baiting or supplemental feeding.

The incompleteness (gray areas), the non-clarity (fuzziness) and the uncertainty (randomness) of the data cause many difficulties that must be addressed with the risk assessment. In China, grasshopper and rodent disasters often occur in remote pastoral regions. This causes the monitored data of biological disaster to have a short series and span a large spatial and temporal scale. As available data are small sample in size, the use of risk assessment is often limited. The grassland biological disaster is a complex non-linear system. For the complex non-linear problems, effective conclusion can not be obtained from the accurate probability theory and mathematical statistics theory, but the fuzziness method may be a better method. In this paper, the one-dimension information diffusion technology adopted in evaluating the grassland biological disaster risk for the small statistical sample. The results show that: The information diffusion technology can make up for the information blank caused by the incompleteness of data, can change the single-valued samples into set-valued samples and excavate the internal law contained in the incomplete sample so as to achieve the aim of making full use of the information. It also can be seen that the diffusion results obtained under different starting control points or different interval step sizes have relatively good consistency and continuity. Based on such stability, a biological disaster risk forecast method can be derived, and the risk map using the reciprocals of different transcending probability values to demonstrate the regional differences on the same disaster level was also made by combining with GIS technology. Compared to other mature theories and technologies, the theory and method of fuzzy information optimization processing has its shortcomings especially in the selection of information diffusion function and information diffusion coefficient, and many improvements are needed.

Current urban dynamic methods have broader views and focus more on ecological aspects, e.g., the impact of emissions and resource consumption, but they lack a rigorous thermodynamic framework. Consequently, there is a need to modify existing processes and develop new technologies that minimize environmental impact while stimulating ecological flow. This paper describes the development of a forecasting model, named the emergy-based urban dynamic model, capable of accurately simulating the observed resource consumption, economic growth, and environmental impact of Beijing from 1999 to 2039. This model differs from previous urban emergy models by monitoring the negative effects to human well-being and ecosystem integrity in the developing urban system. A fresh perspective focuses on urban comprehensive performance, linking such impacts to a supply-side environmental cost evaluation (including ecological service supply, ecological and economic losses, and investment for treatment). In this introductory paper, we present the conceptual considerations of the most important components of the emergy-based urban dynamic model: the urban assets, lands, capitals, population, water resources, and economic and environmental loss. Each subsystem in this model will enrich the feedback dynamics, policy levers, and post-scenario analyses. Statistical information and calibration were also considered in this dynamic emergy accounting. The simulation revealed that water resources will be the most important limiting factor for the sustainable development of Beijing. A better approach would not be more engineering projects to deliver new supplies but to curb demand through efficiency improvements in water supply and consumption using the rule of law and economic incentives. The results of the simulation revealed that after the year 2015, many emergy indicators will collapse. The results of our study will enable urban policy planners to understand these inter-linkages by addressing specific damages to human health and the ecosystem's integrity, as well as by linking such impacts to a supply-side environmental cost evaluation.

Much research shows that plants have the ability to sense each other and avoid entanglement. Competition from other plants causes growth to be redirected away from competitors. Alternatively, phenotypic changes are used to outstrip competitors. Various chemicals can be sensed, including numerous volatiles, and growth can be directed along a gradient of them. Light or mineral gradients are equally used to direct to better growth resources. Behaviour to herbivores, disease pests, and various stresses can be modified by priming. On receipt of a first signal, subsequent responses are faster and larger in the primed plant. Habituation and conditioned behaviour have also been recorded. The ability to investigate, search, survey, examine, and discover is also reported in the literature. Much plant response requires an assessment of likely futures and is active, rather than passive. Phenotypic adjustment is slow, assessing a potential future is essential to avoid the response arriving when the original signal or environment has fundamentally changed. Such behaviour is purposeful, goal-directed, and probably intentional. Finally, plants can assess cost against benefits in situations that may require multiple possible decisions. Although phenotypic adjustment is considered irreversible, except for abscission, at the molecular level, behaviour is reversible.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,,,978-0-19-178829-1; 978-0-19-953954-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,83,92,,,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539543.001.0001,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology,,,WOS:000353917800011,,,,,

Worldwide, invasive vertebrate eradication campaigns are increasing in scale and complexity, requiring improved decision making tools to achieve and validate success. For managers of these campaigns, gaining access to timely summaries of field data can increase cost-efficiency and the likelihood of success, particularly for successive control-event style eradications. Conventional data collection techniques can be time intensive and burdensome to process. Recent advances in digital tools can reduce the time required to collect and process field information. Through timely analysis, efficiently collected data can inform decision making for managers both tactically, such as where to prioritise search effort, and strategically, such as when to transition from the eradication phase to confirmation monitoring. Aims. We highlighted the advantages of using digital data collection tools, particularly the potential for reduced project costs through a decrease in effort and the ability to increase eradication efficiency by enabling explicit data-informed decision making. Methods. We designed and utilised digital data collection tools, relational databases and a suite of analyses during two different eradication campaigns to inform management decisions: a feral cat eradication utilising trapping, and a rodent eradication using bait stations. Key results. By using digital data collection during a 2-year long cat eradication, we experienced an 89% reduction in data collection effort and an estimated USD42 845 reduction in total costs compared with conventional paper methods. During a 2-month rodent bait station eradication, we experienced an 84% reduction in data collection effort and an estimated USD4525 increase in total costs. Conclusions. Despite high initial capital costs, digital data collection systems provide increasing economics as the duration and scale of the campaign increases. Initial investments can be recouped by reusing equipment and software on subsequent projects, making digital data collection more cost-effective for programs contemplating multiple eradications. Implications. With proper pre-planning, digital data collection systems can be integrated with quantitative models that generate timely forecasts of the effort required to remove all target animals and estimate the probability that eradication has been achieved to a desired level of confidence, thus improving decision making power and further reducing total project costs.",,,,,,US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Montrose Settlements Restoration Program; US NavyUnited States Department of Defense; Institute for Wildlife Studies; Parks Canada; Coastal Conservation; Haida Nation,"The authors would like to acknowledge the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Montrose Settlements Restoration Program, US Navy and the Institute for Wildlife Studies for their support to develop data collection systems for the SNI case study, and Parks Canada, Coastal Conservation and the Haida Nation for their support in the Haida Gwaii case study.

In 2013, a total of 69 vascular plant species had been discovered on the island; of these, 59 were present and 39 had established viable populations. Surtsey had more than twice the species of any of the comparable neighbouring islands, and all of their common species had established on Surtsey. The first colonizers were dispersed by sea, but, after 1985, bird dispersal became the principal pathway with the formation of a seagull colony on the island and consequent site amelioration. This allowed wind-dispersed species to establish after 1990. Since 2007, there has been a net loss of species on the island. A study of plant succession, soil formation and invertebrate communities in permanent plots on Surtsey and on two older neighbouring islands (plants and soil) has revealed that seabirds, through their transfer of nutrients from sea to land, are major drivers of development of these ecosystems. In the area impacted by seagulls, dense grassland swards have developed and plant cover, species richness, diversity, plant biomass and soil carbon become significantly higher than in low-impact areas, which remained relatively barren. A similar difference was found for the invertebrate fauna. After 2000, the vegetation of the oldest part of the seagull colony became increasingly dominated by long-lived, rhizomatous grasses (Festuca, Poa, Leymus) with a decline in species richness and diversity. Old grasslands of the neighbouring islands Ellidaey (puffin colony, high nutrient input) and Heimaey (no seabirds, low nutrient input) contrasted sharply. The puffin grassland of Ellidaey was very dense and species-poor. It was dominated by Festuca and Poa, and very similar to the seagull grassland developing on Surtsey. The Heimaey grassland was significantly higher in species richness and diversity, and had a more even cover of dominants (Festuca/Agrostis/Ranunculus). We forecast that, with continued erosion of Surtsey, loss of habitats and increasing impact from seabirds a lush, species-poor grassland will develop and persist, as on the old neighbouring islands.",,,,,,Icelandic Research Council [944180094]; Toyota Iceland,"The Surtsey Research Society has provided logistic support for the study, and transport to the island was in the hands of the Icelandic Coastguard.

Methods: I explore this potential link between behaviour and eco-evolutionary dynamics with controlled field experiments. The experiments manipulated densities of meadow voles foraging in large replicated enclosures. I used the lock-step connection between resource harvest and fitness to generate three fitness surrogates: giving-up densities from artificial resource patches, quitting-harvest rates, and time available for non-foraging behaviours that enhance fitness. Results: Per capita consumption from food trays did not change with population size. Time allocated to foraging increased with population density. Quitting-harvest rates in both safe and risky patches declined linearly with population density. The total amount of time necessary for a new individual to acquire sufficient energy for maintenance increased hyperbolically. Invasion landscapes based on the three fitness surrogates yielded the same behaviourally and evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of habitat selection. But the fitness benefits, subsequent convergence towards the ESS, and potential variation about the ESS, varied. Conclusions: Adaptive foraging behaviour is a reliable and rapid metric for assessing the evolutionary stability of habitat selection. This proof of concept suggests that behavioural metrics may play a prominent role in assessments of other strategies. We may even be able to use behavioural metrics to forecast ecological and evolutionary futures associated with ecological change.",,,,,,,,,,8,8,0,27,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol. Ecol.

Asynchronous or aseasonal planting of rice crops can extend the period when high-quality food is available to rodents. Consequently, rodents may extend their breeding season, increasing population densities. An improved understanding of the effects of food availability and quality on rodent reproduction may enable better forecasts of high rodent population densities in response to asynchronous or aseasonal planting of crops. Aim. The present study examined the association between the quality and quantity of food and the reproductive success of female rice-field rats, Rattus tanezumi and Rattus argentiventer, in a lowland rice landscape in the Philippines. Methods. We evaluated the main dietary components of female rats on two different islands through a cropping season during the 2010 wet season. The breeding performance of 60 female R. tanezumi and 60 R. argentiventer individuals was measured. Key results. Our findings indicated the following: (1) the main dietary items for females of both rodent species during the main breeding season (the booting stage to harvest) were rice panicles and rice seeds; (2) the high protein content of the rice crop at the tillering stage triggered the onset of the main breeding season, leading to the highest rates of conception during the booting and ripening stages; (3) the quantity of food available at the stubble stage provided sufficient nutrient to maintain pregnancy and lactation by females; and (4) asynchronous planting and poor harvest technology could extend the breeding season of rice-field rats. Conclusions. We contend that the extension of the growing season by 3-4 weeks provides high-quality food for rodents, which in turn provides sufficient conditions for higher population densities. The availability of spilled rice grain at the stubble stage is a source of good-quality food for pregnant and lactating females, allowing extension of the breeding season. Implications. Synchronous planting (within 2 weeks) with good post-harvest management of rice stubble are important to prevent high population densities of rice-field rats in lowland rice landscapes in the Philippines.",,,,"Singleton, Grant/B-6230-2013","Singleton, Grant/0000-0002-2154-1223","SenesTech, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation","We thank the farmers in Laguna and San Jose for letting us conduct our experiment in their rice field and their willingness to participate in the project.

Assessing these health impacts by linking the airborne pollen levels, concentrations of respirable allergenic material, and human allergenic response under current and future climate conditions is a key step toward developing preventive and adaptive actions. To that end, a regional-scale pollen emission and transport modeling framework was developed that treats allergenic pollens as non-reactive tracers within the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF/CMAQ) modeling system. The Simulator of the Timing and Magnitude of Pollen Season (STaMPS) model was used to generate a daily pollen pool that can then be emitted into the atmosphere by wind. The STaMPS is driven by species-specific meteorological (temperature and/or precipitation) threshold conditions and is designed to be flexible with respect to its representation of vegetation species and plant functional types (PFTs). The hourly pollen emission flux was parameterized by considering the pollen pool, friction velocity, and wind threshold values. The dry deposition velocity of each species of pollen was estimated based on pollen grain size and density. An evaluation of the pollen modeling framework was conducted for southern California (USA) for the period from March to June 2010. This period coincided with observations by the University of Southern California's Children's Health Study (CHS), which included O-3, PM2.5, and pollen count, as well as measurements of exhaled nitric oxide in study participants. Two nesting domains with horizontal resolutions of 12 and 4 km were constructed, and six representative allergenic pollen genera were included: birch tree, walnut tree, mulberry tree, olive tree, oak tree, and brome grasses. Under the current parameterization scheme, the modeling framework tends to underestimate walnut and peak oak pollen concentrations, and tends to overestimate grass pollen concentrations. The model shows reasonable agreement with observed birch, olive, and mulberry tree pollen concentrations. Sensitivity studies suggest that the estimation of the pollen pool is a major source of uncertainty for simulated pollen concentrations. Achieving agreement between emission modeling and observed pattern of pollen releases is the key for successful pollen concentration simulations.",,,,"Guenther, Alex B/B-1617-2008","Guenther, Alex B/0000-0001-6283-8288; Salam, Muhammad/0000-0002-3565-8916; Chung, Serena/0000-0001-5030-5871",US EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R8343580]; United States Environmental Protection Agency through EPA STAR grantUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R834358],"The authors would like to acknowledge funding for this project via US EPA grant R8343580.

In investigating how global change will affect population vulnerability to climate variability and extremes, the project aims to help develop strategies that enable societies to better cope with the consequences of climate change. In doing so, the basic hypothesis being tested is that societies can develop the most effective long-term defense against the dangers of climate change by strengthening human capacity, primarily through education. Education can directly influence risk perception, skills and knowledge and indirectly reduce poverty, improve health and promote access to information and resources. Hence, when facing natural hazards or climate risks, educated individuals, households and societies are assumed to be more empowered and more adaptive in their response to, preparation for, and recovery from disasters. Indeed the findings from eleven original empirical studies set in diverse geographic, socioeconomic, cultural and hazard contexts provide consistent and robust evidence on the positive impact of formal education on vulnerability reduction. Highly educated individuals and societies are reported to have better preparedness and response to the disasters, suffered lower negative impacts, and are able to recover faster. This suggests that public investment in empowering people and enhancing human capacity through education can have a positive externality in reducing vulnerability and strengthening adaptive capacity amidst the challenges of a changing climate.",,,,,"Muttarak, Raya/0000-0003-0627-4451",European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2008-AdG 230195-FutureSoc],"We would like to thank William Butz, Jan Sendzimir, Stefanie Andruchowitz and all the contributing authors for the investment they have made in putting together this Special Feature.

Results indicate that hatchlings from the Levantine and south-central Mediterranean sites are mainly retained in the same areas of origin, while those from the Ionian area mainly disperse to the Ionian, Adriatic and southcentral Mediterranean areas. Combining hatchling dispersal with existing empirical information on juveniles and adults, a general distribution model among nesting sites, and oceanic and neritic foraging grounds for Mediterranean sea turtles is proposed. The Levantine zone may be particularly key for the conservation of the Mediterranean populations of both species, since it may host the highest concentration of individuals.

Environmental change can, therefore, mediate the strength of consumption relative to production such that the abundance of primary producers is altered, potentially driving phase-shifts from one habitat type to another (e.g. the displacement kelp forests by mats of turfs along temperate coasts). Here, we assessed the extent to which herbivores may counter the increased cover of kelp-competitors (i.e. turfs) anticipated to be caused by enriched nutrients and CO2. Specifically, we experimentally enriched nutrients and CO2 and quantified the change in cover of algal turfs in the presence and absence of gastropod grazers. In the absence of grazers, turf algae responded positively to the combination of enriched nutrients and CO2 such that they occupied >95% of available space. In contrast, where grazers were present, sparse covers of algal turfs were maintained even under CO2 and nutrient enrichment (i.e. turfs occupied <5% of available space). This result indicates that consumption by grazers increased where enrichment of nutrients and CO2 facilitated greater algal cover such that cover continued to be largely restricted.

The implications are heightened by forecasts of a warming and drying climate in these rangelands, which may in itself place native vegetation under increasing stress. While the Dorper breed of sheep offers important production advantages, little is known from research under Australian conditions about their grazing ecology and management requirements from a natural resource perspective. Key factors identified from this review of literature from other countries include a high fertility and fecundity, a generalist feeding strategy, a high growth rate and a capacity to survive and reproduce under low-rainfall conditions. The wider range of plant species selected by the Dorper compared with the traditional Merino breed of sheep potentially creates both opportunities and risks for rangeland condition. Less selective grazing may reduce pressure on some species but the capacity to harvest sufficient nutrients over a smaller area could concentrate grazing and promote resource degradation. High reproductive efficiency under a wide range of seasonal conditions may lead to more rapid onset of overgrazing and will require close attention to both natural resources and animal marketing if resource degradation is to be avoided.",,,,,,,,,,9,10,1,28,,,,1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2014,36,1,,,,,85,90,,10.1071/RJ13034,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000330724900004,,,,,

Here, we use direct estimates of early marine survival obtained from acoustic-tagged yearling Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that entered the Columbia River plume (USA) after migrating down the river and then north to the coastal waters off Willapa Bay, Washington. Plume residence time averaged 7 d, and was of such short duration that predation, rather than feeding and growth conditions, was the likely primary cause of mortality. Plume survival ranged from 0.13 to 0.86, but was stable when scaled by plume residence time, and we find that a simple exponential decay model adequately describes plume survival. Plume survival, and perhaps adult returns, could be improved by reducing plume residence time if the drivers controlling residence time were amenable to management control. However, we show that a statistical model of plume residence time that includes only sea-surface temperature far outperforms models that include river discharge and coastal upwelling. Timing hatchery releases using marine environmental forecasts could potentially improve smolt survival by minimizing their residence time in regions of poor survival.

However, efforts to mitigate bycatch are often hindered by a lack of data on the distributions of fishing effort and protected species. One approach to overcoming this problem has been to overlay the distribution of past fishing effort with known locations of protected species, often obtained through satellite telemetry and occurrence data, to identify potential bycatch hotspots. This approach, however, generates static bycatch risk maps, calling into question their ability to forecast into the future, particularly when dealing with spatiotemporally dynamic fisheries and highly migratory bycatch species. In this study, we use boosted regression trees to model the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort for two distinct fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean, the albacore (Thunnus alalunga) troll fishery and the California drift gillnet fishery that targets swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Our results suggest that it is possible to accurately predict fishing effort using <10 readily available predictor variables (cross-validated correlations between model predictions and observed data approximate to 0.6). Although the two fisheries are quite different in their gears and fishing areas, their respective models had high predictive ability, even when input data sets were restricted to a fraction of the full time series. The implications for conservation and management are encouraging: Across a range of target species, fishing methods, and spatial scales, even a relatively short time series of fisheries data may suffice to accurately predict the location of fishing effort into the future. In combination with species distribution modeling of bycatch species, this approach holds promise as a mitigation tool when observer data are limited. Even in data-rich regions, modeling fishing effort and bycatch may provide more accurate estimates of bycatch risk than partial observer coverage for fisheries and bycatch species that are heavily influenced by dynamic oceanographic conditions.",,,,,,Lenfest Ocean Program through an NRC Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program,"We thank Rich Cosgrove for help with GIS analysis of the data, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center data managers for converting fisheries logbooks into an electronic format, the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Lab for maintaining the satellite data and providing the xtracto code, and the Lenfest Ocean Program for funding CUS through an NRC Postdoctoral Research Associateship Program.",,,32,34,0,30,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Capturing the pattern of variability within a system (enough to declare a significant change from past to present) relies on correct assumptions about the temporal scale of the processes involved. Sufficient long-term data are often lacking, and current techniques have their weaknesses. To address this concern, we constructed multistate and artificial neural network models (ANN) to provide fore- and hindcast vegetation communities considered critical foraging habitat for an endangered bird, the Florida Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis). Multistate models were not able to hindcast due to our data not satisfying a detailed balance requirement for time reversibility in Markovian dynamics. Multistate models were useful for forecasting and providing environmental variables for the ANN. Results from our ANN hindcast closely mirrored the population collapse of the Snail Kite population using only environmental data to inform the model.

After experiencing a period of arrested growth, individuals often show compensatory growth responses by modifying their life-history, behaviour and physiology. However, the strength of compensatory responses may vary across broad geographic scales as populations differ in their exposition to varying time constraints. We examined differences in compensatory growth strategies in common frog (Rana temporaria) populations from southern and northern Sweden. Tadpoles from four populations were reared in the laboratory and exposed to low temperature to evaluate the patterns and mechanisms of compensatory growth responses. We determined tadpoles' growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency during the compensation period. In the absence of arrested growth conditions, tadpoles from all the populations showed similar (size-corrected) growth rates, food intake and growth efficiency. After being exposed to low temperature for 1 week, only larvae from the northern populations increased growth rates by increasing both food intake and growth efficiency. These geographic differences in compensatory growth mechanisms suggest that the strategies for recovering after a period of growth deprivation may depend on the strength of time constraints faced by the populations. Due to the costs of fast growth, only populations exposed to the strong time constraints are prone to develop fast recovering strategies in order to metamorphose before conditions deteriorate. Understanding how organisms balance the cost and benefits of growth strategies may help in forecasting the impact of fluctuating environmental conditions on life-history strategies of populations likely to be exposed to increasing environmental variation in the future.",,,,"Orizaola, German/A-5217-2008","Orizaola, German/0000-0002-6748-966X",Fundacion Caja Madrid; Fundacion Ramon Areces; Helge Ax:son Johnsons Stiftelse; Stiftelsen Oscar och Lili Lamms Minne; Stiftelsen for Zoologisk Forskning; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council,"We thank Frank Johansson and Alfredo Nicieza for comments on a previous draft of the manuscript.

In parts of Scotland, harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) have been in decline for 10 years. To evaluate the contributions of different proximate causes (survival, fecundity, observation artefacts) to this decline, we collated behavioural, demographic and population data from one intensively studied population in part of the Moray Firth (north-east Scotland). To these, we fit a state-space model comprising age-structured dynamics and a detailed account of observation errors. After accounting for culling (estimated by our model as 14 % of total mortality), the main driver of the historical population decline was a decreasing trend in survival of young individuals combined with (previously unrecognised) low levels of pupping success. In more recent years, the model provides evidence for considerable increases in breeding success and consistently high levels of adult survival. However, breeding success remains the most volatile demographic component of the population. Forecasts from the model indicate a slow population recovery, providing cautious support for recent management measures. Such investigations of the proximate causes of population change (survival, fecundity and observation errors) provide valuable short-term support for the management of population declines, helping to focus future data collection on those ultimate causal mechanisms that are not excluded by the demographic evidence. The contribution of specific ultimate drivers (e.g. shooting mortality or competitors) can also be quantified by including them as covariates to survival or fecundity.",,,,"Thompson, Paul M/B-6742-2009","Thompson, Paul M/0000-0001-6195-3284; Thompson, David/0000-0003-1546-2876; Matthiopoulos, Jason/0000-0003-3639-8172",,,,,17,17,1,49,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2014,174,1,,,,,151,162,,10.1007/s00442-013-2764-y,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000329624300015,24036987,,,,

In this study, we simulate potential range shifts of 176 plant species to perform a detailed prognosis of critical range decline and extinction in a transformed mediterranean landscape. Particularly, we seek to answer two pivotal questions: (1) what are the general plant-extinction patterns we should expect in mediterranean landscapes during the 21st century? and (2) does dispersal ability prevent extinction under climate change? LocationAndalusia: southern Iberian Peninsula; 87,597km(2); 300 by 520km. MethodsWe gathered information on the dispersal traits of 176 plant species (dispersal vector, average and maximum dispersal distances, shape of the dispersal kernel). We used these data to feed a stochastic dynamic species distribution model (a combination of a cellular automaton with an ensemble of species distribution models) to simulate plant range shift under climate change with realistic dispersal under two different warming scenarios. We compared dispersal and non-dispersal simulations to assess the influence that climate change and species-distribution characteristics exert on plant-extinction patterns. ResultsThe dispersal simulation showed a lower percentage of extinct (-1%) and quasi-extinct species (-19%) than did the non-dispersal simulation. Summer temperatures of 37 degrees C and 33 degrees C, respectively, accelerated the critical range decline and extinction rates. The average elevation of the plant populations was the variable with the highest influence on extinction probability. Main conclusionsStochastic dynamic species distribution models proved to be useful when there was lack of data on dispersal distances and population dynamics.

MethodsWe quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen-Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species. ResultsAs expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion success when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Climate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions. Main conclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that propagule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions.",,,,"Bacher, Sven/F-5431-2010","Bacher, Sven/0000-0001-5147-7165",Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),"This work was supported by a grant of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) to A.

Arkansas River shiner represent a threatened reproductive ecotype considered especially well adapted to the harsh environmental extremes of the Great Plains. Historic (n=163 records) and current (n=47 records) species distribution models were constructed using a vector-based approach in MaxEnt by splitting the available data at a time when Arkansas River shiner dramatically declined. Discharge and stream order were significant predictors in both models; however, the shape of the relationship between the predictors and species presence varied between time periods. Drift distance (river fragment length available for ichthyoplankton downstream drift before meeting a barrier) was a more important predictor in the current model and indicated river segments 375-780km had the highest probability of species presence. Performance for the historic and current models was high (area under the curve; AUC>0.95); however, forecasting and backcasting to alternative time periods suggested less predictive power.

The expansion of human land uses, such as urban and crop cover, typically degrades water quality and reduces freshwater biodiversity, thereby jeopardizing both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Identifying and mitigating future threats to freshwater ecosystems requires forecasting where land use changes are most likely. Our goal was to evaluate the potential consequences of future land use on freshwater ecosystems in the coterminous United States by comparing alternative scenarios of land use change (2001-2051) with current patterns of freshwater biodiversity and water quality risk. Using an econometric model, each of our land use scenarios projected greater changes in watersheds of the eastern half of the country, where freshwater ecosystems already experience higher stress from human activities. Future urban expansion emerged as a major threat in regions with high freshwater biodiversity (e.g., the Southeast) or severe water quality problems (e.g., the Midwest). Our scenarios reflecting environmentally oriented policies had some positive effects. Subsidizing afforestation for carbon sequestration reduced crop cover and increased natural vegetation in areas that are currently stressed by low water quality, while discouraging urban sprawl diminished urban expansion in areas of high biodiversity. On the other hand, we found that increases in crop commodity prices could lead to increased agricultural threats in areas of high freshwater biodiversity. Our analyses illustrate the potential for policy changes and market factors to influence future land use trends in certain regions of the country, with important consequences for freshwater ecosystems. Successful conservation of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services in the United States into the future will require attending to the potential threats and opportunities arising from policies and market changes affecting land use.",,,,"Radeloff, Volker/B-6124-2016; Lewis, David J/I-5700-2013","Radeloff, Volker/0000-0001-9004-221X; Lewis, David J/0000-0002-2161-4189; Pracheil, Brenda/0000-0001-9073-6254",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF);  [DEB-1115025],"We gratefully acknowledge support for this study by the National Science Foundation Coupled Natural-Human Systems Program and DEB-1115025, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative, and a Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering.

LocationMainland Spain. MethodsIberian newts (Triturus pygmaeus and Triturus marmoratus, a recently identified species) were used as examples. Environmental favourability models were performed on the occurrence of the newts according to two taxonomic options: (1) the two species separately; and (2) the two species together, as they were considered a single species by taxonomists until recently. The models were projected to three time periods between 2011 and 2100 within a context of climate change, using two different general circulation models and two emission scenarios. We calculated the discrepancy between forecasts produced with the different taxonomic options and their consistency under the same climate change scenario. ResultsThe model based on the two species together did not distinguish between particular environmental requirements of either of the two species. Discrepancy values between taxonomic options increased over time.

In particular, the role of temporal variability in environmental severity or consumer pressure has been not explored either empirically or theoretically. Here, through a spatially explicit model (i.e. a two-dimensional lattice), we show that variations in the temporal variance of environmental stress can be as important as those in the mean intensity in regulating the spatial distribution and coexistence range of species differing in their relative competitive ability and tolerance to stress, as well as the direction and magnitude of their interactions.

The prototype simulator features the following main components: a level-set-based fire propagation solver that adopts a regional-scale viewpoint, treats wildfires as propagating fronts, and uses a description of the local rate of spread (ROS) of the fire as a function of vegetation, topographical and meteorological properties based on Rothermel's model; a series of observations of the fire front location; and a data assimilation algorithm based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The data assimilation algorithm also features a choice between a parameter estimation (PE) approach in which the estimation targets are the input parameters of the ROS model, and a state estimation (SE) approach in which the estimation targets are the spatial coordinates of the discretized fire front. This study shows the extension of the FIREFLY data-driven simulator to complex terrain topography. The fire propagation is represented by time-evolving two-dimensional fronts along the horizontal plane in order to remain consistent with the formulation of the PE-/SE-based EnKF algorithms that were initially developed for flat terrain configuration. While evaluated on synthetic cases in this study, the performance of the EnKF algorithm is shown to be preserved in the case of complex terrain.

A recent review of dead fuel moisture research by Matthews (2014) concluded that one of the key research and modeling needs is the capacity to represent the complexity of vegetation structure and topography and forecast fuel moisture content across the landscape. Fine fuel moisture content varies at a range of spatial scales due to many factors, however in complex, steep and dissected landscapes, topographic aspect can play a significant role in small-scale (ie. scales in the order of 10's ha) variability. Experimental sites for monitoring microclimate variables and moisture content in litter and in near-surface soils were established at a control site and on four contrasting aspects (north, south, east and west) in southeast Australia. At each of the four microclimate sites sensors are arranged to measure the soil moisture (2 replicates), fine dead surface fuel moisture at 2.5cm depth (12 replicates), precipitation throughfall (3 replicates), radiation (3 replicates), and screen level relative humidity, air temperature, leaf wetness, and wind speed (1 replicate of each). Temperature and relative humidity are also measured within the dead fine surface fuel using Ibutton's (4 replicates). All measurements are logged continuously at 15 min intervals. The moisture content of the fine dead surface fuel is estimated using high-replication of low-cost continuous soil moisture sensors placed at the centre of a 5cm deep sample of fine dead surface fuel, referred to here as ""dead fine fuel packs"". The dead fine fuel packs were constructed from fuels collected from the area surrounding the microclimate site. The initial results show the moisture regime on the forest floor was highly sensitive to the incoming shortwave radiation, which was up to 6 times higher in the north-facing (equatorial) slopes due to slope orientation and the sparse vegetation compared to vegetation on the south-facing (polar facing) slopes. Differences in shortwave radiation resulted in peak temperatures within the litter that were up to 2 times higher on the equatorial-facing site than those on the polar-facing site. For instance, on a day in November 2013 with maximum open air temperature of 35o C, the temperatures within the litter layer at the north-facing and south-facing sites were 54o C and 32o C, respectively, despite air temperature at the two sites differing by less than 2o C. The minimum gravimetric water content in the litter layer on the same day was 21% on the equatorial-facing slope and 85% on the polar-facing slope.

There is no global fire/no fire map, no detection under cloud cover, false negatives are common, and the detection squares are much coarser than the resolution of a fire behavior model. Consequently, current active fire satellite detection products should be used to improve fire modeling in a statistical sense only, rather than as a direct input. We describe a new data assimilation method for active fire detection, based on a modification of the fire arrival time to simultaneously minimize the difference from the forecast fire arrival time and maximize the likelihood of the fire detection data. This method is inspired by contour detection methods used in computer vision, and it can be cast as a Bayesian inverse problem technique, or a generalized Tikhonov regularization.

Accuracy of the fire spread models is evaluated by comparing simulated fire spread perimeters with the reported spatio-temporal distribution of the wildfire event, at three different time steps. Results show good agreement between the simulated and observed burned area perimeters (Sorensen metric). Some differences are found in specific fire propagation time intervals. When simulations are initialized using the reported ignition point, FARSITE progressively shows an underestimation of the fire's time of arrival, whereas HFire shows an overestimation for some time steps. Initializing fire-spread simulations with active-fires ignition points improves time of arrival predictions for some time steps. FARSITE is able to predict abrupt changes in rate of spread and fire line intensity, consistent with the reported information for the wildfire event.

Portugal is already experiencing an increase in the number and extent of wildfires, with records of burnt extent exceeding 400,000ha and 300,000ha in 2003 and 2005, respectively. With the projected future increase in the frequency of large wildfires, those negative impacts and fire suppression difficulties will also likely increase. Spatially explicit wildfire spread models (e.g. FARSITE) are one of the most effective tools to understand complex interactions among topography, vegetation fuel and weather conditions. These models can be used not only to study past fire events but also for forecasting fire spread and behavior. MODIS active fires have a large potential to provide relevant information regarding the spatio-temporal distribution of large wildfire events. When combined with fire spread models, they may provide crucial information to overcome the error propagation that arise when simulating large and long duration wildfire events, which is crucial for monitoring and forecasting fires in an operational fire-fighting context. We investigated nine large wildfires (>=10,000ha) that occurred in Portugal between 2001 and 2012 in order to evaluate if combining fire growth simulations with active fire data improves the accuracy of fire spread predictions. To achieve this goal we propose to: 1) simulate fire growth using FARSITE model in combination with the time and spatial information of the MODIS active fires during the fire event propagation; and 2) assess the performance of fire spread simulations comparing them with the spatio-temporal distribution of the active fires. Additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of key model parameters and variables on fire growth simulations, to understand the main sources of error and identify future work needed to improve the use of combined model-satellite approach in an operational context. Results show that fire growth simulations are improved when satellite-derived active fires were used to reinitialize the simulation while the fires are occurring. Sorensen coefficients obtained for these simulations assisted by MODIS active fires were all above 0.5, showing a significant improvement over full fire growth event simulations. This innovative approach of combining satellite active fires data with fire spread simulations reduces the propagated errors of the large and long duration fire events and improves the forecasting ability of fire spread models.",,,,,"Benali, Akli/0000-0002-4325-3804; Santos, Fabio/0000-0003-3682-5955",,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-989-26-0884-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,811,822,,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6_90,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Forestry,,,WOS:000400252000091,,,,,

First, we will review results of two studies attempting to characterize LAT use between initial attack (IA) and extended attack and/or large fire support (EA) missions. Collectively these studies identified significant LAT use for EA despite a history of prioritizing LATs for IA, and further identified potentially counterintuitive results where fires receiving LAT support during IA were more likely than not to escape IA efforts. These results suggest potential operational efficiencies in LAT use, and that improving success in IA efforts may be in part premised on reducing the time between ignition and LAT arrival on the fire. Here we examine trade-offs between LAT usage for IA and LAT unavailability for IA operations due to EA use. To do so we use a mathematical optimization model to identify efficient LAT air base location and deployment strategies. The model is designed to minimize the total deployment time of meeting LAT IA demand, with demand quantified as a function of a fire weather index. Results indicate, as expected, that model performance degrades as LATs are increasingly unavailable. Results further indicate substantial sensitivity of LAT air base location strategy to LAT availability, with potentially significant implications for air base staffing and capacity decisions, as well as fleet composition decisions.

Fuel discontinuity limits the spread of fire in some eucalypt woodlands under moderate weather conditions, but fires can spread extensively in woodland under severe fire weather conditions. This paper reconstructs the spread of five large fires ignited by lightning that each burnt more than 90 000 ha. Fires remained active for up to 70 days after ignition until they encountered areas of sparse fuel associated with salt lakes and previous burn scars, or were extinguished by rain. Fire perimeters were mapped using daily NOAA AVHRR and MODIS satellite imagery and used to determine periodic growth in fire area. Weather conditions associated with each fire were examined using observations from a limited number of sites. Fire growth was episodic and strongly associated with periods of high temperature, extreme dryness and strong winds. An event of extraordinary fire growth was identified during the 1994 Forrestania fire which increased in area by more than 350 000 ha during a 24 hour period. The influence of weather on fire spread is being examined using re-analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Interim Re-analysis project ERA-1 which provides spatial and temporal data coverage not otherwise available due to the sparse observation network. South-western Australia provides a unique opportunity to examine factors influencing the duration, scale and growth characteristics of fires burning in semi-arid landscapes unimpeded by fire suppression. High intensity fires can cause widespread mortality of mature woodland trees with recovery to a mature structure taking several centuries, and the role of fire in development and persistence of eucalypt woodlands is currently a topic of scientific interest.

Wildfire models and simulators attempt to assist fire responders in gaining understanding of the fire behaviour. The main hurdle to overcome when applying such technologies at operational level is the lack of a complete model that describes wildfire governing physics and the trade-off between accuracy and computing time. A forecasting prediction must be delivered within a positive lead time and current physical models are far beyond this requirement. Inverse modelling and data assimilation techniques offer a great potential of operational applicability in wildfires, coupling fire monitoring and fire behaviour forecast at real time. With this approach, a better description of the processes simulated by the fire behaviour models can be achieved when adding real-state information of the system, since discrepancies between simulated fire behaviour variables and observed variables are minimized. The use of this approach accelerates fire simulations without loss of forecast accuracy. In this paper we explore the adaptation to real fire scenarios of a synthetic-data-based inverse modelling structure for fire behaviour forecast. Improvements are investigated to extrapolate the already existing algorithm to real data assimilation from IR aerial monitoring. The technique explores elliptical Huygens expansion coupled with simple -yet effective-semi-empirical wildfire models. The algorithm assimilates fire fronts positions extracted from airborne thermal imaging and additional available data as wind speed and direction or fuel characteristics. The invariants -set of governing parameters that are mutually independent and constant for a significant amount of time-are resolved by means of forward model and linear tangent minimization. The technique has been adapted to be employed in large-scale mallee-heath shrubland fires experiments conducted in South Australia in 2008. Fires were filmed with a helicopter transported TIR camera. The IR images were processed to obtain the position of the fire perimeter at a maximum frequency of one isochrone every 10 seconds.

FWI is an accumulative index, that is, subindexes values for a day D are used for the calculation of the final index the following day D+1. The procedures for the calculation for Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands were initialized by AEMET in 2008 March, being executed daily without interruption since then. Canarias Islands procedures are being executed since 2013 May. Procedures include analysis for day D and forecasts for day D+1, D+2 and D+3 in a 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees horizontal resolution grid cells with data provided by the HIRLAM numerical weather prediction model. FWI values calculated for a determinate localization have no meaning for themselves. It's necessary to make a correspondence between the danger classes and those FWI values in order to calibrate it. For this, five danger classes split has been calculated only from a climatological point of view. Each class or risk level corresponds with a range of values of FWI between different percentiles. Thus, fire low risk corresponds with FWI values below its percentile 40; moderate risk with FWI values between percentile 40 and 65; high risk between percentile 65 and 85; very high risk between percentile 85 and 95 and extreme fire risk above its percentile 95.

The use of a reliable index of risk among the existing preventive measures is fundamental to a more efficient planning of prevention and an effective action of fight. The work involving the forest fire prevention must use all the tools available since it is a complex task and one that shows great variability in the time of occurrence. One such tool is the degree of danger by means of an index that reflects the probability of fire occurrence. Meteorological indices have shown good results in predicting events and contributing to the work of forecasting fire in forests. The aim of this study was to analyze 4 descriptive fire risk indices for the period from 01/01/2006 to 12/31/2012. Each of them was built with 4 hazard classes of risk. The indices used were Formula de Monte Alegre (FMA), Index of Nesterov, Index of Telicyn and P-EVAP According to the results, the rate of P-EVAP performed better in accuracy of forecasts of occurrences within the class of High Risk, while the FMA was the most effective in the forecast of no occurrence in classes of Low Risk and No Risk. The days classified as Medium Risk in Telicyn indices and P - EVAP presented closest to the average of occurrences in the entire series averages. Knowledge of descriptive classes of indices for predicting fire is valuable to communicate with public, help the actions of awareness, prevent and plan accident.

This objective may be achieved through optimisation of extinguishing activities. The basic requirement of such activities is accurate forecasting of forest fire risk depending on meteorological and physical conditions in forests. The purpose of the research was to prepare a new method of forecasting forest fire risk, which would enable a more precise method of evaluation of the risk of an outbreak of fire in relation to existing and forecast meteorological conditions in forests. Establishing provisional assumptions of the new method accepted: possibility of determining actual fire risk, possibility of forecasting forest fire risk for the afternoon hours in the morning hours of the given day and the following day, possibility of forecasting the moisture content of pine litter (Pinus silvestris L.), preparation of a method enabling limitation of fire prevention system operating costs. To enable drawing up a fire risk forecast (in the morning for the hours of the afternoon and the following day) formulae were drawn up equally enabling calculation of predicted moisture content of pine litter on the basis of its actual current values and forecast meteorological values. The basis for assessment of the proposed method were data relating to the frequency of occurrence of particular degrees of risk, average number of fires in forecast zone depending on the degree of risk and also the average area of fire at the given degree. The drawn up method is based on moisture measurements of flammable material, which has a significant relationship to its precision. Selection of test material-pine litter is adjusted to the specific conditions occurring in the majority of pine stands (Pinus silvestris L.) in Poland. As a result of the work it was possible to create a prognosis method enabling precise establishment of the fire risk in forests according to the accepted assumptions. The results obtained during testing of this method indicate a high accuracy in forecasting fire risk and a satisfactory precision of formulae for calculating moisture content of litter. On this basis it may be stated that the drawn up method enables a decidedly better means to define the actual fire risk, simultaneously providing its forecast for later hours and it is currently introduced for application in fire protection of Polish forests.

We utilized historical fire occurrence data and archived forecasts to assess how well the 7-Day Outlook predicts wildfire ignitions and escaped fires, ultimately to help characterize the effectiveness of this tool for prepositioning national firefighting resources. The historical fire occurrence data track ignitions on all land ownerships; from this dataset, we established number and location of ignitions and final fire size for the years 2009-2011 for Predictive Service Areas (PSAs) within the Northwest and Southwest Geographic Areas. These data were then matched to the corresponding PSA and appropriate forecast for each of the seven days prior to the ignition date. Final fire size was used as a metric to establish whether an ignition escaped initial attack, with fires greater than 121.4 hectares (300 acres) considered escaped. Our results show that 7-Day Outlook values yield better-than-random prediction of large fire activity, although there is wide variation in this relationship among individual PSAs. In addition, the number of escaped fires increased with the number of ignitions, with this relationship showing a distinct regional pattern. Fires were more likely to escape during certain times of the year, with this season being earlier in the Southwest than in the Northwest.

Where they coincide with human populations, they have the potential to have substantial impacts on human values. Consequently, strategies are adopted by land managers to reduce the probability of fire occurrence and, in the event of a fire, reduce subsequent impacts. One such strategy has involved the adoption of fire danger ratings. These are levels of alertness that are applied at a regional level on a daily basis. They are based on preceding and forecast weather and provide an indication of the potential severity of fire behaviour. Danger ratings are generally based on weather derived indices and have limited ability to represent the contribution of landscape attributes to potential impacts, including the properties of vegetation (fuels) and the amount and spatial configuration of vulnerable assets. We propose an alternative method for representing fire danger using fire simulation. An ensemble approach is demonstrated whereby thousands of virtual fires are ignited on a regular grid and simulated on a daily basis using forecast weather with the model PHOENIX RapidFire. Each fire is simulated in succession and burns for a specified period. Fire simulations integrate the contributions of local fuel, topography and weather to fire behaviour. The resultant fires can be aggregated to provide spatially explicit representations of potential spread patterns.

However, recent scientific and technological advances offer a vast number of possibilities towards advanced emergency preparedness during firefighting operations, if integrated in a single on-line platform. In this context, this paper addresses the following question: can models be successfully merged with personal sensors aiming to build an advanced Decision Support System (DSS) focused on the preservation of firefighter's safety, while pursuing an enhanced response to wildfires? The goal of this research is to develop an emergency response support system for firefighting ground-based operations during forest fire events. The target of the under-development computational tool is to provide knowledge-based aid to firefighters at critical decision-making situations, helping with the safe and successful management of fire. This DSS will support the following features: -capture of 'live' sensor data from a set of wearable monitoring equipment that will be based on a previously developed certified medical wearable technology named ""VitalJacket (R)""; -capture of meteorological observations from a mast placed in one of the vehicles; -enable projections of fire progression, smoke levels and critical exposure in a predefined time-step (up to 30 minutes); -interpretation of results in an easy and intuitive form to be used by fire managers or firefighters involved in operations. To achieve this goal hardware technology (e.g. wearable, mobile, communications) was combined with processing/simulation software algorithms that run under a user interactive interface. A data assimilation technique will allow near real-time observations from wearable monitoring equipment to be integrated into the exposure forecast modelling system, increasing the accuracy of the estimates. A first prototype of the DSS, running in off-line mode, will be tested in the terrain during the fire season of 2014. An improved online version of the prototype will be tested in the following autumn in a series of prescribed burns. In conclusion, this work proposes the development and testing (under real conditions) of a DSS intended to provide optimized firefighting efficiency, enhanced hazard awareness, and knowledge-based response to forest fire events. Advances in the computational modelling of fire and smoke behaviour, in conjunction with personal monitoring data, provide near real-time simulation of local fire conditions and short-term smoke exposure forecasts, with the needed advance in time to permit the safe and efficient positioning of crews in the terrain.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,,,,,,978-989-26-0884-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,1386,1394,,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6_152,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Forestry,,,WOS:000400252000153,,,,,

In both 2012 and 2013 large fire suppression exceeded the Agency's budget allocations by over $ 400 million (US$). Despite the scale of this investment relatively little is understood about how suppression actions influence large wildfire spread and those conditions that ultimately lead to containment. There is considerable uncertainty in managing large wildfires including the quality of weather forecasts, complex environmental conditions, variation in the type and quality of suppression resources, and whether or not requested suppression resources will be assigned. In this presentation we review several recent studies that attempt to understand how suppression actions influence fire progression of large wildland fires in the US. Finney et al. (2009) who established the critical importance of quiescent fire growth periods in achieving final fire containment. Holmes and Calkin (2013) used econometric analyses including Cobb-Douglas production functions and production possibility frontiers to examine the effect of different suppression resources and fire characteristics on daily reported fire containment. We extend the Holmes and Calkin (2013) analysis by focusing on geospatially delineated fire progression maps to identify how suppression resources and fire characteristics influenced the amount of fire perimeter that held on a given day. Additionally we review a small sample of large fires where field based data collection allows us to better understand the types of mission and relative efficiency and effectiveness of field based crews. Despite these recent efforts, there remains limited understanding of suppression effectiveness. These results suggest that modelling large fire containment as a production process of fireline construction similar to traditional initial attack models is inappropriate. Improved understanding of large fire management effectiveness and efficiency will require spatially tracking individual resource assignments, activities, and tactics within the broader suite of fire management objectives and strategies.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,,,978-989-26-0884-6,,,,2014,,,,,,,1548,1552,,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6_170,10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Forestry,,,WOS:000400252000171,,,,,

The need to make efficient use of available budgets requires directing funding towards areas with the lowest costs and maximum benefits. Accordingly, incorporating econometric tools enables establishing criteria to optimize budget allocation. Modelling the fire suppression process and budget allocation requires knowing how suppression is managed, how resources are dispatched and how costs are incurred. The methodological approach presented here allows forecasting fire suppression operations productivity, based on suppression difficulty and cost, as well as records from documented fire suppression operation plans from prior fires. On the other side, the value of natural forest resources and the damage and losses from forest fires assessing, help to determining the change net value to estimate the economics fire impacts. For the efficiency analysis of the fire program, is possible using the VISUAL-SEVEIF (Spanish acronym for System for the Economic Evaluation of Wildfires) software tool, to obtain the knowledge of fire behavior and its direct effect on the depreciation of natural resources value, providing the total costs of the losses in the area affected by the wildfire, and the value of the losses for each of the resources identified within the fire perimeter.

Ecosystem-specific tracers of net CO2 uptake and net CO2 release were used to investigate the contributions to the tower signal of key land covers within its footprint, and how contributions varied at seasonal and interannual timescales. In addition, WRF-SPA simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations were compared with two coarse global inversion models, CarbonTrackerEurope and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's CarbonTracker (CTE-CT). WRF-SPA realistically modelled both seasonal (except post harvest) and daily cycles seen in observed atmospheric CO2 at the tall tower (R-2 = 0.67, rmse= 3.5 ppm, bias= 0.58 ppm). Atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the tall tower were well simulated by CTECT, but the inverse model showed a poorer representation of diurnal variation and simulated a larger bias from observations (up to 1.9 ppm) at seasonal timescales, compared to the forward modelling of WRF-SPA. However, we have highlighted a consistent post-harvest increase in the seasonal bias between WRF-SPA and observations. Ecosystem-specific tracers of CO2 exchange indicate that the increased bias is potentially due to the representation of agricultural processes within SPA and/or biases in land cover maps. The ecosystem-specific tracers also indicate that the majority of seasonal variation in CO2 uptake for Scotland's dominant ecosystems (forests, cropland and managed grassland) is detectable in observations within the footprint of the tall tower; however, the amount of variation explained varies between years. The between years variation in detectability of Scotland's ecosystems is potentially due to seasonal and interannual variation in the simulated prevailing wind direction.

Currently, many marine primary producers use HCO3- for photosynthesis, but this is energetically costly. Increasing passive CO2 uptake relative to HCO3- pathways could provide energy savings, leading to increased productivity and growth of marine plants. Inorganic-carbon-uptake mechanisms in the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica were determined using the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (AZ) and the buffer tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS). Amphibolis antarctica seedlings were also maintained in current and forecasted CO2 concentrations to measure their physiology and growth. Photosynthesis of A. antarctica was significantly reduced by AZ and TRIS, indicating utilization of HCO3- -uptake mechanisms. When acclimated plants were switched between CO2 treatments, the photosynthetic rate was dependent on measurement conditions but not growth conditions, indicating a dynamic response to changes in dissolved CO2 concentration, rather than lasting effects of acclimation. At forecast CO2 concentrations, seedlings had a greater maximum electron transport rate (1.4-fold), photosynthesis (2.1-fold), below-ground biomass (1.7-fold) and increase in leaf number (2-fold) relative to plants in the current CO2 concentration. The greater increase in photosynthesis (measured as O-2 production) compared with the electron transport rate at forecasted CO2 concentration suggests that photosynthetic efficiency increased, possibly due to a decrease in photorespiration. Thus, it appears that the photosynthesis and growth of seagrasses reliant on energetically costly HCO3- acquisition, such as A. -antarctica, might increase at forecasted CO2 concentrations. Greater growth might enhance the future prosperity and rehabilitation of these important habitat-forming plants, which have experienced declines of global significance.",,,,"Russell, Bayden D./R-9325-2019; Connell, Sean/A-8874-2008","Russell, Bayden D./0000-0003-1282-9978; Watling, Jennifer/0000-0001-6305-9905; Irving, Andrew/0000-0002-9763-2148; Connell, Sean/0000-0002-5350-6852",ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council,S.D.C. and B.

Here we present a set of analytical tools for synthesizing different levels of distributional and/or demographic data to produce meaningful assessments of invasion potential that can guide management at multiple phases of ongoing invasions, from dispersal to colonization to proliferation. We illustrate the utility of data-synthesis and data-model assimilation approaches with case studies of three well-known invasive speciesa vine, a marine mussel, and a freshwater crayfishunder current and projected future climatic conditions. Results from the integrated assessments reflect the complexity of the invasion process and show that the most relevant climatic variables can have contrasting effects or operate at different intensities across habitat types.

Our results identified and quantified both bottlenecks and windows of opportunity for invasion, mainly related to the role of human uses of the landscape or to disruption of the flow of resources.

Relatively small temperature increases could cause animals to exceed these thresholds more often, resulting in substantial fitness costs or even death. Oviparous species could be especially vulnerable because the maximum thermal tolerances of incubating embryos is often lower than adult counterparts, and in many species mothers abandon the eggs after oviposition, rendering them immobile and thus unable to avoid extreme temperatures. As a consequence, the effects of climate change might become evident earlier and be more devastating for hatchling production in the tropics. Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) have the widest nesting range of any living reptile, spanning temperate to tropical latitudes in both hemispheres. Currently, loggerhead sea turtle populations in the tropics produce nearly 30% fewer hatchlings per nest than temperate populations. Strong correlations between empirical hatching success and habitat quality allowed global predictions of the spatiotemporal impacts of climate change on this fitness trait. Under climate change, many sea turtle populations nesting in tropical environments are predicted to experience severe reductions in hatchling production, whereas hatching success in many temperate populations could remain unchanged or even increase with rising temperatures. Some populations could show very complex responses to climate change, with higher relative hatchling production as temperatures begin to increase, followed by declines as critical physiological thresholds are exceeded more frequently. Predicting when, where, and how climate change could impact the reproductive output of local populations is crucial for anticipating how a warming world will influence population size, growth, and stability.",,,,,,,,,,42,44,7,183,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this study, we compared the body size, condition, and recruitment of polar bears captured in the Chukchi and Bering Seas (CS) between two periods (1986-1994 and 2008-2011) when declines in sea ice habitat occurred. In addition, we compared metrics for the CS population 2008-2011 with those of the adjacent southern Beaufort Sea (SB) population where loss in sea ice habitat has been associated with declines in body condition, size, recruitment, and survival. We evaluated how variation in body condition and recruitment were related to feeding ecology. Comparing habitat conditions between populations, there were twice as many reduced ice days over continental shelf waters per year during 2008-2011 in the SB than in the CS. CS polar bears were larger and in better condition, and appeared to have higher reproduction than SB bears. Although SB and CS bears had similar diets, twice as many bears were fasting in spring in the SB than in the CS. Between 1986-1994 and 2008-2011, body size, condition, and recruitment indices in the CS were not reduced despite a 44-day increase in the number of reduced ice days. Bears in the CS exhibited large body size, good body condition, and high indices of recruitment compared to most other populations measured to date. Higher biological productivity and prey availability in the CS relative to the SB, and a shorter recent history of reduced sea ice habitat, may explain the maintenance of condition and recruitment of CS bears.

Although this has traditionally been achieved through data-driven correlative modelling, robustly extrapolating these models into novel climatic conditions is challenging. Recently, a small number of process-based or mechanistic distribution models have been developed to complement the correlative approaches. However, tests of these models are lacking, and there are very few process-based models for invasive species. We develop a method for estimating the range of a globally invasive species, common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), from a temperature- and photoperiod-driven phenology model. The model predicts the region in which ragweed can reach reproductive maturity before frost kills the adult plants in autumn. This aligns well with the poleward and high-elevation range limits in its native North America and in invaded Europe, clearly showing that phenological constraints determine the cold range margins of the species. Importantly, this is a forward' prediction made entirely independently of the distribution data. Therefore, it allows a confident and biologically informed forecasting of further invasion and range shifting driven by climate change. For ragweed, such forecasts are extremely important as the species is a serious crop weed and its airborne pollen is a major cause of allergy and asthma in humans. Our results show that phenology can be a key determinant of species' range margins, so integrating phenology into species distribution models offers great potential for the mechanistic modelling of range dynamics.",,,,"Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Chapman, Daniel/O-5100-2019; Chapman, Daniel S/C-2900-2008","Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Chapman, Daniel S/0000-0003-1836-4112; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ENV.B2/ETU/2010/0037]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [CEH010021],This research was funded by the European Commission under ENV.B2/ETU/2010/0037.

To formulate a simple mechanistic model using neutral theory that links extinction debt with the species-area relationship (SAR). Location World-wide. Methods We use the neutral model of biodiversity to describe how a community subject to immigration responds to an insular contraction. We investigate the species richness at different times after the habitat-loss event. We compare this with observed species losses in avian studies. Results From the model, two SARs emerge: one with a shallow slope for a habitat area before habitat loss and another with a steeper slope for the habitats that remain after habitat loss. From these curves, the first predicts imminent extinctions while the second predicts total extinctions. The difference between the two curves gives the delayed extinctions, namely the number of species that are lost during the relaxation of the community to equilibrium. The model agrees well with observed relaxation rates in communities of birds. The lag times for relaxation are often very large, with half-lives in the order of thousands of years for remnant areas above 5000 km(2). In many parameter combinations explored, the majority of extinctions are delayed extinctions, and may exceed imminent extinctions by orders of magnitude. Main conclusions Extinction debt is a major reason for failures to observe extinctions following habitat loss. Our modelling approach supports the view that a significant proportion of extinctions are delayed, so that the predictions of SARs (as currently applied) are liable to underestimate total extinctions.

Planning institutions use land use zoning to control and direct such changes. Urban growth models are commonly used to better understand past landscape changes as well as, forecast and plan for future landscape changes. Many of these models, however, do not utilize zoning, information in their deployment because many model designers do not believe zoning to be a relevant, criterion for the prediction of urban growth. This research offers a novel methodology for integrating, zoning information into a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH. It additionally tests the, utility of such information by comparing metrics of fit with past data under different zoning inclusion, conditions in a community of Miami-Dade County, Florida. These conditions include one scenario, where zoning is ignored and three others where it is included. The latter three test different methods, of including zoning data for three generalized zoning categories - arbitrarily guessing, measuring urban, growth in each zoning category for the entire study area, and measuring urban growth in each zoning, category only in those areas more likely to experience growth. Results indicate that this final condition, generates the highest model performance metric and creates a more fair comparison since remote, areas in the study area, less likely to experience growth, exaggerate differences in urban growth rates, across the different zoning categories. We conclude that zoning information, when utilized, appropriately, improves model performance and is therefore relevant for landscape change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the early phase of an outbreak that was developing across a 268,000 km(2) area over a period of 9 years (2003-2011). The territory was subdivided in 225 km(2) cells, and the relative influence of forest composition, elevation, forest age, average degree-days and soil drainage were examined during three development phases of the outbreak: initial epicenter location, relatively long-distance spread (cell-to-cell expansion), and expansion inside individual cells (within-cell expansion). The results indicate that elevation is the most determinant variable for initial epicenter location. Other variables that were identified as important for outbreak development by previous studies, such as forest composition and average degree-days, were not so important during this phase. However, forest composition and average degree-days were important factors during the cell-to-cell and within-cell expansion phases. Separating outbreak development in distinct phases also allowed to integrate phase-specific spatial and temporal covariates that were highly significant in the models, such as distance from previous year defoliations during the cell-to-cell expansion phase, and the proportion of defoliated stands during the preceding year for the within-cell expansion phase. Overall, this study provides limited evidence that patterns of SBW outbreak expansion could be altered by reducing host tree species abundance in the forest [mainly balsam fir (Abies balsamea) in this region]. More generally, this study suggests that the influence of environmental variables on SBW outbreak development is clearly phase-dependent, and that this landscape-level, process-based approach could be useful to forecast insect outbreak development in forest ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,29,29,2,56,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

To evaluate starvation resistance in first-feeding ephyrae of the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita s.l., we determined their point of no return (PNR50), i.e. days of starvation after which 50% of ephyrae die even if they then feed. PNR50 values were 33.8, 38.4 and 58.6 d at 15, 12 and 9 degrees C, respectively. Before reaching PNR50, the ephyrae showed significant body size reduction: ca. 30 and 50% decrease in disc diameter and carbon content, respectively. These PNR50 values are nearly 1 order of magnitude longer than those of larval marine molluscs, crustaceans and fishes, which is attributable to the ephyra's extremely low metabolic (i.e. respiration) rate relative to its copious carbon reserves. Such a strong endurance under prolonged starvation is likely an adaptive strategy for A. aurita ephyrae, the release of which is programmed to occur during the annual period of lowest temperatures, allowing them to cope with the concomitant seasonal food scarcity.

We investigated 179 potential breeding sites in subarctic Finland and subjected the data to detailed bioclimate envelope modelling using three state-of-the-art techniques: generalized additive models, maximum entropy and generalized boosting methods. Moreover, we included local environmental factors in the models to investigate whether they improve model performance. Under all tested climate change projections and irrespective of the modelling method, the suitable habitat for R. temporaria increased in warming climate. The inclusion of local abiotic variables significantly improved the performance of the models. However, June temperature appeared to be the most informative variable in all modelling approaches: a major increase in the extent of suitable habitat occurred when it increased by 1 degrees C.

In a thermal gradient, tadpoles selected temperatures between 16.5-22.2 degrees C (mean, 19.60 +/- 0.6 degrees C). We reared tadpoles in streams colder, warmer, or close to thermal preference. Temperature effects were mediated through algal quantity and quality. Mortality increased with increasing deviation from preferred temperatures, but the effects were ameliorated when tadpole diet was supplemented with algae (Cladophora glomerata with epiphytic nitrogen-rich diatoms, Epithemia spp.) harvested from sun-lit channels. Distribution of frogs in free-flowing and dammed reaches within a northern California watershed was in equilibrium with tadpole thermal preference. Populations were dense (>= 125 breeding females/km) where July water temperatures averaged 17.5-19 degrees C in 2010, a relatively cool summer. Below 16 degrees C, frogs were sparse with open canopy and absent under closed canopy. Integration of thermoregulatory behavior with ecological context can thus be useful to forecast recruitment when the thermal regimes of rivers are altered by anthropogenic factors.

For this reason, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has proposed a shift towards qualitative or mixed models to detect potential risk events, generally of low frequency and high impact, starting with qualitative data from interviews and expert surveys. As yet, the BIS principles are not often used in companies different from those in the banking sector. This paper applies these directives in order to detect operational risks (OpR) in electric utilities. Another aspect considered in this article is the establishment of indicators derived from energy units, which are not affected by macroeconomic factors in order to display data of the OpR in electric enterprises; consequently enabling financial agents to make more reliable forecasts. The BCBS-BIS has shown that the Poisson and log-normal distributions are those that best represent the frequency and impact of the OpR. This article shows that such distributions are also characteristic in the electric sector and can be implemented for data that have qualitative origins. Just as the Operational Value at Risk (OpVaR) is widely used in the banking sector, it is also shown that energy companies can apply it. Among the different methods to obtaining OpVaR, the Montecarlo's method was adopted in order to convolute severity and frequency distributions, and the distribution of losses for different risks in the electricity sector.",,,,"Portela-Garcia, Marta/L-5646-2014; Rodriguez-Monroy, Carlos/H-3594-2016","Portela-Garcia, Marta/0000-0002-4103-0519; Rodriguez-Monroy, Carlos/0000-0002-3402-1876",,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,DEC,2013,38,12,,,,,828,835,,,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000330682900002,,,,,

These models, however, are subject to important assumptions and limitations. By integrating two independent but complementary methods, ensemble SDMs and statistical phylogeography, we addressed key assumptions and created robust assessments of climate change impacts on species distributions while improving the conservation value of these projections. LocationNorth American cordillera. MethodsThis approach was demonstrated using the arctic-alpine plant Rhodiola integrifolia (Crassulaceae). SDMs were fitted to current and past climates using eight models, two thresholds and one to three climate data sets. These projections were combined to create a map of stable climate (refugia) since the Last Interglacial (124,000kya). Five biogeographic hypotheses were developed based on the configuration of refugia and tested using statistical phylogeography. Projection of SDMs into the future was contingent on agreement across approaches; future projections (to 2085) used five climate data sets and two greenhouse gas scenarios. ResultsA multiple-refugia hypothesis was supported by both methods, confirming the assumption of niche conservatism in R.integrifolia and justifying the projection of SDMs onto future climates. Future projections showed substantial loss of climatically suitable habitat. Southern populations had the greatest losses, although the biogeographic scale of modelling may overpredict extinction risks in areas of topographic complexity. Past and future SDMs were assessed for novel values of climate variables; areas of novel climate were flagged as having higher uncertainty. Main conclusionsIntegrating molecular approaches with spatial analyses of species distributions under global change has great potential to improve conservation decision-making. Molecular tools can support and improve current methods for understanding the vulnerability of species to climate change and provide additional data upon which to base conservation decisions, such as prioritizing the conservation of areas of high genetic diversity to build evolutionary resiliency within populations.",,,,,"Bunn, Andrew/0000-0001-9027-2162; Forester, Brenna/0000-0002-1608-1904",Western Washington University; Huxley College; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ARC - 0714232],"B.F. would like to thank Wilfried Thuiller for assistance with modelling questions and Gavin Schmidt, Joy Singarayer and Michel Crucifix for facilitating climate data access.

A general overview of the current wild fire regimes (WRs) and impacts on forest ecosystems and environment is provided. One distinctive feature of WRs is the increasing frequency of disastrous wild fires. The application of various remote sensing instruments has shown that the average vegetation wild fire area in Russia for 1998-2010 accounted for 8.2 +/- 0.8 x 10(6) ha, with about two-thirds of wildfires occurring on forest lands and half on the forested lands. The average annual fire carbon balance during the above period was 121 +/- 28 Tg C yr(-1), including 92 +/- 18 Tg C yr(-1) emitted from the forested land. The forecasts based on the General Circulation Models suggest the dramatic acceleration of fire regimes by the end of the 21st century. Taking into account the increase in the dryness of the climate and the thawing of permafrost, this will likely lead to a dramatic loss of forested area and the impoverishment of the forest cover over a major part of the forest zone. A transition to adaptive forestry would allow a substantial decrease of the expected losses.

Climate change will increase both average temperatures and extreme summer temperatures. Analyses of the fitness consequences of climate change have generally omitted negative fitness and population declines associated with heat stress. 2. Here, we examine how seasonal and interannual temperature variability will impact fitness shifts of ectotherms from the past (1961-1990) to future (2071-2100), by modelling thermal performance curves (TPCs) for insect species across latitudes. 3. In temperate regions, climate change increased the length of the growing season (increasing fitness) and increased the frequency of heat stress (decreasing fitness). Consequently, species at mid-latitudes (20-40 degrees) showed pronounced but heterogeneous responses to climate change. Fitness decreases for these species were accompanied by greater interannual variation in fitness. An alternative TPC model and a larger data set gave qualitatively similar results. 4. How close maximum summer temperatures are to the critical thermal maximum of a species - the thermal buffer - is a good predictor of the change in mean fitness expected under climate change. Thermal buffers will decrease to near or below zero by 2100 for many tropical and mid-latitude species. 5.

Looking at potential spatial aggregation of invasive species, we identify three future hotspots of invasion in Europe, northeastern North America, and Oceania. We also emphasize that some regions could lose a significant number of invasive alien species, creating opportunities for ecosystem restoration. From the list of 100, scenarios of potential range distributions show a consistent shrinking for invasive amphibians and birds, while for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates distributions are projected to substantially increase in most cases.

There is increasing research focus on intermodel variation, but comparisons between mechanistic (MMs) and empirical models (EMs) are rare despite both being used widely in this field. We combined MMs and EMs to project future (2055) changes in the potential distribution (suitability) and productivity of maize and spring wheat in South Africa under 18 downscaled climate scenarios (9 models run under 2 emissions scenarios). EMs projected larger yield losses or smaller gains than MMs. The EMs' median-projected maize and wheat yield changes were -3.6% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to 6.5% and 15.2% for the MM. The EM projected a 10% reduction in the potential maize growing area, where the MM projected a 9% gain. Both models showed increases in the potential spring wheat production region (EM=48%, MM=20%), but these results were more equivocal because both models (particularly the EM) substantially overestimated the extent of current suitability. The substantial water-use efficiency gains simulated by the MMs under elevated CO2 accounted for much of the EM-MM difference, but EMs may have more accurately represented crop temperature sensitivities. Our results align with earlier studies showing that EMs may show larger climate change losses than MMs. Crop forecasting efforts should expand to include EM-MM comparisons to provide a fuller picture of crop-climate response uncertainties.",,,,"Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008","Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971; Tadross, Mark/0000-0002-7018-404X",Princeton Environmental Institutes Grand Challenges Program,"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Princeton Environmental Institutes Grand Challenges Program.

In particular, to test whether the predictive ability of SDMs depends on species traits or the inclusion of land cover and soil type, and whether distributional changes at expanding range margins can be predicted accurately. LocationFinland MethodsUsing 10-km resolution butterfly atlas data from two periods, 1992-99 (t(1)) and 2002-09 (t(2)), with a significant between-period temperature increase, we modelled the effects of climatic warming on butterfly distributions with boosted regression trees (BRTs) and generalized additive models (GAMs). We evaluated model performance by using the split-sample approach with data from t(1) (non-independent validation'), and then compared model projections based on data from t(1) with species' observed distributions in t(2) (independent validation'). We compared climate-only SDMs to SDMs including land cover, soil type, or both. Finally, we related model performance to species traits and compared observed and predicted distributional shifts at northern range margins. ResultsSDMs showed fair to good model fits when modelling butterfly distributions under climate change. Model performance was lower with independent compared with non-independent validation and improved when land cover and soil type variables were included, compared with climate-only models. SDMs performed less well for highly mobile species and for species with long flight seasons and large ranges. When forecasting changes at northern range margins, correlations between observed and predicted range shifts were predominantly low. Main conclusionsSDMs accurately describe current distributions of most species, yet their performance varies with species traits and the inclusion of land cover and soil type variables. Moreover, their ability to predict range shifts under climate change is limited, especially at the expanding edge.

At moderate-to-high population densities, elephants can damage vegetation, especially when enclosed in protected areas. This study examines the effects of elephant browsing on woody trees in Majete Wildlife Reserve (WR), south-western Malawi. Regression analysis is used to assess the associations of six factors known to drive elephant browsing in other areas and determine which ones have the most influence on browsing at Majete WR. Twenty-four per cent of tagged trees had been subject to elephant browsing. The model with vegetation type, stem diameter and distance from permanent water correctly predicted browsing for 80% of the observations. Elephants mostly favoured riparian woodlands, followed by Acacia-dominated woodland and Brachystegia-dominated woodland. Browsing occurrence was negatively related to distance from permanent water and diameter at breast height(DBH). A larger number of trees, sampled at random and covering a larger portion of the reserve would provide more reliable estimates of browsing and related factors. Knowledge of time- and site-specific factors affecting elephant browsing can be used to forecast future habitat transformations and manipulate the range of the elephants within the reserve.

Warming-induced activity restriction has been proposed as a general explanatory mechanism for recent population extinctions in lizards, and has been used to forecast future extinction. Here, I test this hypothesis using globally applied biophysical calculations of the effects of warming and shade reduction on potential activity time and whole-life-cycle energy budgets. These thermodynamic niche' analyses show that activity restriction from climate warming is unlikely to provide a general explanation of recent extinctions, and that loss of shade is viable alternative explanation. Climate warming could cause population declines, even under increased activity potential, through joint impacts on fecundity and mortality rates.

Here we describe a method for calculating shifts in a metapopulation's range-margin based on the geographical centroid of spatially distributed patches, where the population abundance of each patch or each landscape grid cell is used to weight its geographical (X-Y) coordinate. We evaluated our approach against a detailed virtual example and two real-world applications (threatened mountain hare in Britain and invasive European rabbits in Australia). We also investigated smoothing techniques to better portray overall trends in range changes through time. These procedures were implemented in a new user-friendly software tool, which can process the output file of the popular RAMAS Metapop software. We develop a scenario analysis to show how our weighted-centroid approach can be used to recommend species management options that are most important to long-term population viability (e.g., to choose between increasing connectivity, habitat quality or translocation) under different demographic scenarios. We show that calculating a smoothed time series of weighted centroids from a spatially explicit metapopulation model provides: (i) a useful way to identify the demographic momentum, or momentum of population shift, of the metapopulation (rather than just spatial aggregation or individual-patch behaviour) of a species through geographic space in response to climate change; and (ii) an informative metric of range movement that complements predictions of change in range area or total population size, and extirpation or founding of patches.

In this study, we address two important questions related to the ramifications of the statistical assumptions typically made about the model structural error and the prospect of Bayesian calibration to guide the optimization of model complexity. Regarding the former issue, we examine statistical formulations that whether postulate conditional independence or explicitly accommodate the covariance among the error terms for various model endpoints. Our analysis evaluates the differences in the posterior parameter patterns and predictive performance of a limiting nutrient (phosphate)-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (particulate phosphorus) model calibrated with three alternative statistical configurations. The lessons learned from this exercise are combined with those from a second comparative analysis that aims to optimize model structure. In particular, we selected three formulas of the zooplankton mortality term (linear, hyperbolic, sigmoidal) and examine their capacity to determine the posterior parameterization as well as the reproduction of the observed ecosystem patterns. Our analysis suggests that the statistical characterization of the model error as well as the mathematical representation of specific ecological processes can be influential to the inference drawn by a modeling exercise. Our findings could be useful when selecting the most suitable statistical framework for model calibration and/or making informative decisions about model structure optimization. In the absence of adequate prior knowledge, we also advocate the use of Bayesian model averaging for obtaining weighted averages of the forecasts from different model structures and/or statistical descriptions of the process error terms.

Species assemblage along environmental gradients is subject to the interplay of biotic interactions in complement to abiotic filtering and stochastic forces. Accounting for complex biotic interactions for a wide array of species remains so far challenging. Here, we propose using food web models that can infer the potential interaction links between species as a constraint in species distribution models. Using a plant-herbivore (butterfly) interaction dataset, we demonstrate that this combined approach is able to improve species distribution and community forecasts. The trophic interaction network between butterfly larvae and host plant was phylogenetically structured and driven by host plant nitrogen content allowing forecasting the food web model to unknown interactions links. This combined approach is very useful in rendering models of more generalist species that have multiple potential interaction links, where gap in the literature may occur.

By modelling the changes of different indices describing such patterns - trait means, extremes and diversity in communities - as a function of abiotic gradients, we could understand their drivers and build projections of the impact of global change on the functional components of biodiversity. We used five plant functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content and seed mass) and non-woody vegetation plots to model several indices depicting community-level patterns of functional traits from a set of abiotic environmental variables (topographic, climatic and edaphic) over contrasting environmental conditions in a mountainous landscape. We performed a variation partitioning analysis to assess the relative importance of these variables for predicting patterns of functional traits in communities, and projected the best models under several climate change scenarios to examine future potential changes in vegetation functional properties. Not all indices of trait patterns within communities could be modelled with the same level of accuracy: the models for mean and extreme values of functional traits provided substantially better predictive accuracy than the models calibrated for diversity indices. Topographic and climatic factors were more important predictors of functional trait patterns within communities than edaphic predictors. Overall, model projections forecast an increase in mean vegetation height and in mean specific leaf area following climate warming. This trend was important at mid elevation particularly between 1000 and 2000 m a.s.l. With this study we showed that topographic, climatic and edaphic variables can successfully model descriptors of community-level patterns of plant functional traits such as mean and extreme trait values.

In this context, a key, surprisingly understudied question is: when an exotic plant is introduced, which herbivores will adopt this new potential host? Whether the plant is a weed, an ornamental, or a crop, the development versus non-development of a novel plant-insect interaction can have profound effects for both economic and conservation applications. In this paper, we sketch mechanistic and statistical frameworks for predicting these interactions, based on how plant and herbivore traits as well as shared evolutionary history can influence detection, recognition, and digestion of novel plants. By emphasizing mechanisms at each of these steps, we hope to clarify different aspects of novel interactions and why they may or may not occur. We also emphasize prediction and forecasting, as a major goal is to know in advance which interactions will develop from the many plant or insect introductions that occur in natural and man-made systems.",,,,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",USDA regional project [NC7]; NSF-GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD),"We would like to thank Neal Williams, Sarah Dalrymple and Scott Carroll for useful discussion on this manuscript.

In contrast to direct effects of temperature on herbivores, indirect effects mediated via thermal effects on host-plant quality are only poorly understood, despite having the potential to substantially impact performance and thereby to alter responses to the changing climatic conditions. We here use a full-factorial design to explore the direct (larvae were reared at 17 degrees C or 25 degrees C) and indirect effects (host plants were reared at 17 degrees C or 25 degrees C) of temperature on larval growth and life-history traits in the temperate-zone butterfly Pieris napi. Direct temperature effects reflected the common pattern of prolonged development and increased body mass at lower temperatures. At the higher temperature, efficiency of converting food into body matter was much reduced being accompanied by an increased food intake, suggesting compensatory feeding. Indirect temperature effects were apparent as reduced body mass, longer development time, an increased food intake, and a reduced efficiency of converting food into body matter in larvae feeding on plants grown at the higher temperature, thus indicating poor host-plant quality. The effects of host-plant quality were more pronounced at the higher temperature, at which compensatory feeding was much less efficient. Our results highlight that temperature-mediated changes in host-plant quality are a significant, but largely overlooked source of variation in herbivore performance. Such effects may exaggerate negative effects of global warming, which should be considered when trying to forecast species' responses to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,39,40,2,150,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this study, we use ecological niche models to infer the current and future distribution of New Caledonian Parakeets (Cyanoramphus saisseti), Horned Parakeets (Eunymphicus cornutus), and Ouvea Parakeets (Eunymphicus uvaeensis) in New Caledonia. In addition, we present a new method of assessing the population size of each species based on the relationship between local abundance and modelled habitat suitability. According to our estimates, there are 5708 (5048-6174) New Caledonian Parakeets on the main island of New Caledonia, distributed over an area of 2783 km(2), of which 1939 km(2) is forested. We estimate there to be 8690(7934-9445) Horned Parakeets, and their distribution extends over 3482 km(2), including 2162 km(2) of forest. In comparison, the Ouvea Parakeet has a very restricted range of 34 km(2) (most of which is forested), and a population estimated at 1730 (963-3203) individuals. Projections involving simulated climate change suggest that populations of New Caledonian Parakeets and Horned Parakeets may recede into areas at higher altitudes in the future, primarily along the central mountain chain of the mainland. It is difficult to predict how the Ouvea Parakeet will respond to the climatic changes forecast for Ouvea, as the species is expected to face climatic conditions in the future that are different from any of those currently experienced on the island. Our research demonstrates that the current reserve system in New Caledonia is unlikely to provide sufficient protection for parakeets. Hence, we believe that existing Important Bird Areas (IBAs) should be evaluated for their current and future potential as reserves. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We illustrated the method by forecasting suitable habitat for bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in the Interior Columbia River Basin, USA, under recent and projected 2040s and 2080s climate conditions.

But the rate of change is hard to predict, even across a set of published laboratory predator-prey experiments, and very similar trait changes can result from very different molecular mechanisms, even within one species. Evolutionary rescue (adaptive response to a detrimental environmental change) is common, but not always effective. The full range is observed, from little to almost complete compensation for environmental change. Cases of limited compensation show that strong selection is necessary, but not sufficient for rapid adaptation. The response of the copepod Onychodiaptomus sanguineus to fluctuating predation shows that the time-scale of environmental variation is important. The response of Daphnia galeata to eutrophication shows that life-history trade-offs and constraints can prevent evolution from buffering the entire life history against environmental changes. Eco-evolutionary dynamics are harder to predict when traits affecting multiple interactions evolve. Theory predicted, and experiments confirmed, a much larger range of possible evolutionary outcomes when a prey species evolves defences against two predators rather than one. These and other recent findings suggest that the devil is in the details: many subtle factors, such as how trade-offs depend on resource availability, can have large effects on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Ecologists are increasingly engaged in predicting the ecological effects of human impacts such as species introductions and climate change. Forecasting evolutionary responses is part of that challenge. One implication of the newest synthesis' is that rapid adaptation to changing conditions is nothing new, so the past and present can tell us a lot about the future. If prediction is our goal, then developing predictive theory for eco-evolutionary dynamics, and testing it in tractable model systems, should be a priority. Lay Summary",,,,,,Andrew W.

However, forecasts of climate change impacts on species' geographic distributions rarely incorporate a demographic understanding of species' responses to climate. Because many biotic and abiotic factors at multiple scales control species' range limits, experimentation is essential to establish underlying mechanisms. We used a manipulative climate change experiment embedded within a natural climate gradient to examine demographic responses of 12 prairie species with northern range limits within the Pacific Northwest, USA. During the first year, warming decreased recruitment of species even at the coolest edge of their current ranges, but this effect disappeared when they were moved poleward beyond their current ranges. This response was largely driven by differences in germination rates. Other vital rates responded in unique and sometimes opposing ways (survivorship vs. fitness) to species' current ranges and climate change, and were mediated by indirect effects of climate on competition and nutrient availability. Our results demonstrate the importance of using regional-scale climate manipulations and the need for longer-term experiments on the demographic responses that control species' distributions.",,,,"Little, Chelsea J./H-8676-2019; Bridgham, Scott/R-1557-2017","Little, Chelsea J./0000-0003-2803-7465; Bridgham, Scott/0000-0003-0614-2678","Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research; BER), U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-09ER604719]; University of Oregon Library","We thank The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Center for Natural Lands Management (CNLM), and The Deer Creek Center for site use; TNC, CNLM, the City of Eugene, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and Joint Base Lewis-McChord (U.S. Army) for native seed donations; Timothy Tomaszewski, Cody Evers, Hannah Wilson, Dani Fagan, Aryana Ferguson, Sean McKenzie, Belle Tegner, and numerous undergraduate volunteers for assistance with laboratory and field work; Ed Alverson for compiled lists of PNW prairie species and fidelity class; and Bruce Kimball for assistance with the heating technology.

Species composition and the distribution of functional traits - traits that define species in terms of their ecological roles - within riparian plant communities are rapidly changing in response to various global change drivers. Here, we present a conceptual framework illustrating how changes in dependent wildlife communities and ecosystem processes can be predicted by examining shifts in riparian plant functional trait diversity and redundancy (overlap). Three widespread examples of altered riparian plant composition are: shifts in the dominance of deciduous and coniferous species; increases in drought-tolerant species; and the increasing global distribution of plantation and crop species.

Currently, the methods used to generate these predictive maps generally focus on deterministic processes and omit stochasticity and other uncertainty in model outputs. Here we present a novel approach to model the means and variance of assemblage properties. LocationThe western Swiss Alps. MethodsWe propose a new approach to processing probabilistic predictions derived from stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) in order to predict and assess the uncertainty in predictions of community properties. We compare the utility of our novel approach with that of a traditional threshold-based approach. We used data sampled in 2009 and 2010 from 192 sites in total for mountain butterfly communities spanning a large elevational gradient as a case study and evaluated the ability of our approach to model the species richness and phylogenetic diversity of communities within an ensemble forecasting framework. ResultsOur approach allowed mapping of the variability in species richness and phylogenetic diversity projections, in addition to the mean, for 78 butterfly species. S-SDMs reproduced the observed decrease in phylogenetic diversity and species richness with elevation, a consequence of environmental filtering. The prediction accuracy of community properties varied along environmental gradients: at low elevations, variability was higher for predictions of species richness while it was the opposite for phylogenetic diversity. Main conclusionsThe use of our probabilistic approach to process species distribution model outputs in order to reconstruct communities provides an improved picture of the range of possible assemblage realizations under similar environmental conditions given modelling uncertainty, and helps to inform managers of the usefulness of modelling results.",,,,"Ferrier, Simon/C-1490-2009; Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020","Ferrier, Simon/0000-0001-7884-2388; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [FP6 2006 GOCE 036866]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A-125145]; Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [12-126430]; SNSFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PBNEP3-140192]; Vital-IT facilities of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics,"We thank Alexander Von Ungern, Virginie Favre, Valery Udry, Yannick Chitarro, Sarah Giovanettina, Vanessa Rion, Christian Purro and Saskia Godat for field assistance.

In particular, we were interested in whether the two approaches were congruent and identified the same glacial refugia. LocationSouth-western European Alps. MethodsFor the phylogeographical analysis we included 352 individuals from 28 populations of P.marginata and 172 individuals from 15 populations of P.latifolia and used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). For palaeodistribution modelling, species distribution models (SDMs) were based on extant species occurrences and then projected to climate models (CCSM, MIROC) of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), c.21ka. ResultsThe locations of the modelled LGM refugia were supported by various indices of genetic variation. The refugia of the two species were largely geographically isolated, overlapping only 6-11% of the species' total LGM distribution. This overlap decreased when the position of the glacial ice sheet and the differential elevational and edaphic distributions of the two species were considered. Main conclusionsThe combination of phylogeography and palaeodistribution modelling proved useful in locating putative glacial refugia of the two alpine species of Primula. The phylogeographical data allowed us to identify those parts of the modelled LGM refugial area that were likely source areas for recolonization. The use of SDMs predicted LGM refugial areas substantially larger and geographically more divergent than could have been predicted by phylogeographical data alone.",,,,"Pearman, Peter/C-6298-2011; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011","Pearman, Peter/0000-0002-0794-101X; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [110000],"Special thanks go to E.

Location South Australia. Methods We assessed the ability of 20 GCMs to simulate observed seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) between 1980-1999, globally, and regionally for the Indian and Pacific Oceans south of the Equator. We used model rankings to characterize a set of representative climate futures, using three different-sized GCM ensembles and two individual GCMs (the Parallel Climate Model and the Community Climate System Model, version 3.0). Ecological niche models were then coupled to physiological information to compare forecast changes in area of occupancy, population size and harvest area based on forecasts using the various GCM selection methods, as well as different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and climate sensitivities. Results We show that: (1) the skill with which climate models reproduce recent SST records varies considerably amongst GCMs, with multimodel ensemble averages showing closer agreement to observations than single models; (2) choice of GCM, and the decision on whether or not to use ensembleaveraged climate forecasts, can strongly influence spatiotemporal predictions of range, abundance and fishing potential; and (3) comparable hindcasting skill does not necessarily guarantee that GCM forecasts and ecological and evolutionary responses to these forecast changes, will be similar amongst closely ranked models. Conclusion By averaging across an ensemble of seven highly ranked skilful GCMs, inherent uncertainties stemming from GCM differences are incorporated into forecasts of change in species range, abundance and sustainable fishing area. Our results highlight the need to make informed and explicit decisions on GCM choice, model sensitivity and emission scenarios when exploring conservation options for marine species and the sustainability of future harvests using ecological niche models.",,,,"Bradshaw, Corey J.A./A-1311-2008; Mellin, Camille/X-9161-2019; Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013; Mellin, Camille/AAB-1768-2019; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Caley, Julian/A-4042-2008","Bradshaw, Corey J.A./0000-0002-5328-7741; Mellin, Camille/0000-0002-7369-2349; Fordham, Damien A/0000-0003-2137-5592; Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Caley, Julian/0000-0001-5739-749X","Australian Research Council Discovery ProjectAustralian Research Council [DP1096427, DP120101019, FS110200051, FT100100200]; Marine Biodiversity Hub; Australian Government National Environmental Research ProgramAustralian Government","Funded by Australian Research Council Discovery Project grants DP1096427 (D.A.F., B.W.B.) and DP120101019 (B.W.B., C.J.A.B.), Super Science Fellowship FS110200051 (D.A.F.) and Future Fellowship FT100100200 (B.W.B.).

In this study, we estimated the vulnerability of three endangered Malagasy baobab species (Adansonia grandidieri Baill., Adansonia perrieri Capuron and Adansonia suarezensis H. Perrier) to climate change and the effectiveness of the protected area network (PAN) for the future conservation of these species. To estimate the environmental niche of the species, we used an original data-set based on satellite image analysis to detect species presence and an ensemble modelling approach using three species distribution models (GLM, GAM and MaxEnt). We projected the species distribution in 2050 and 2080 using an ensemble forecasting approach combining the three species distribution models and three global circulation models for climate projections. Measures of connectivity were employed to assess the present and future effectiveness of the existing PAN. Among the three baobab species studied, two are severely threatened by climate change (A. perrieri and A. suarezensis), in part because the present PAN does not overlap with future species distribution areas. Recently, strong efforts have been made in designing an optimised PAN to conserve Madagascar outstanding biodiversity. Nevertheless, its future effectiveness is questioned by the potential shifts in species distributions due to predicted changes in climate. In the context of climate change, alternative strategies such as ecological restoration would also have to be adopted to conserve biodiversity in Madagascar. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated how well data on 82 populations of 20 species of plants spanning 3 continents explained and predicted plant population dynamics. We parameterized stage-based matrix models with demographic data from individually marked plants and determined how well these models forecast population sizes observed at least 5 years into the future. Simple demographic models forecasted population dynamics poorly; only 40% of observed population sizes fell within our forecasts' 95% confidence limits. However, these models explained population dynamics during the years in which data were collected; observed changes in population size during the data-collection period were strongly positively correlated with population growth rate. Thus, these models are at least a sound way to quantify population status. Poor forecasts were not associated with the number of individual plants or years of data. We tested whether vital rates were density dependent and found both positive and negative density dependence. However, density dependence was not associated with forecast error. Forecast error was significantly associated with environmental differences between the data collection and forecast periods. To forecast population fates, more detailed models, such as those that project how environments are likely to change and how these changes will affect population dynamics, may be needed. Such detailed models are not always feasible. Thus, it may be wiser to make risk-averse decisions than to expect precise forecasts from models. Habilidad de los Modelos Matriciales para Explicar el Pasado y Predecir el Futuro de las Poblaciones de Plantas Resumen La incertidumbre asociada con el pronostico ecologico ha sido reconocida durante un largo tiempo pero rara vez se cuantifica su seguridad. Evaluamos que tan bien la informacion de 82 poblaciones de 20 especies de plantas a lo largo de 3 continentes explica y predice la dinamica de poblacion de las plantas. Realizamos parametros con modelos matriciales con base en estadios con datos demograficos a partir de plantas marcadas individualmente y determinamos que tan bien estos modelos pronostican el tamano de las poblaciones al menos 5 anos en el futuro. Los modelos demograficos simples pronosticaron pobremente las dinamicas de poblacion; solamente el 40% de las poblaciones observadas cayo dentro de los limites de confianza de 85% de nuestros pronosticos. Estos modelos sin embargo explicaron la dinamica de poblacion a lo largo de los anos en los que se colectaron datos; los cambios observados en el tamano de la poblacion durante el periodo de colecta de datos estuvieron positivamente correlacionados con la tasa de crecimiento de la poblacion. Asi, estos modelos son por lo menos una manera segura de cuantificar el estado de la poblacion. Los pronosticos debiles no estuvieron asociados con el numero de plantas individuales o con los anos de datos. Probamos si las tasas vitales dependian de la densidad y encontramos que existe dependencia hacia la densidad tanto positiva como negativa, sin embargo la dependencia de densidad no se asocio con el error de pronostico. El error de pronostico estuvo significativamente asociado con diferencias ambientales entre la recoleccion de datos y los periodos de pronostico. Para predecir el destino de las poblaciones se necesitan modelos mas detallados, como aquellos que proyectan los cambios probables en el ambiente y como estos cambios afectaran a la dinamica de las poblaciones. Tales modelos tan detallados no siempre son factibles. Por ello puede ser mejor tomar decisiones aversas a riesgos que esperar pronosticos precisos de los modelos.",,,,"Thorpe, Andrea/AAH-2684-2020; Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F/F-7263-2013; Williams, Jennifer/AAG-9660-2019; Oostermeijer, Johannes GB/N-8909-2013; Williams, Jennifer L/H-1717-2011; Valverde, Teresa/M-1596-2019","Thorpe, Andrea/0000-0002-0670-4135; Williams, Jennifer/0000-0002-4497-4961; Williams, Jennifer L/0000-0002-4497-4961; Ehrlen, Johan/0000-0001-8539-8967","National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0553768]; University of California, Santa BarbaraUniversity of California System; State of California","This work was conducted as a part of the Testing Matrix Models Working Group supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a Center funded by the National Science Foundation (grant#EF-0553768), the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the State of California.",,,72,72,7,188,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.",,,,"Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/O-8956-2019; Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009; Kraft, Nathan J.

(2013, Freshwater Biology, 58, 463-482) forecasted changes in plankton dynamics in temperate, polar and tropical regions resulting from climate change. For tropical regions, they predicted an increase in precipitation intensity that would increase nutrient loading, increasing phytoplankton biomass and select for plankton adapted to flushing. 2. We do not agree with these predictions, as regional projections from the IPCC did not forecast a major increase in precipitation in tropical regions. The only regions where a slight increase in precipitation was projected were eastern Africa and South-East Asia. In eastern Africa, the major freshwater bodies are large, deep lakes that have very long residence times and are unlikely to be affected by flushing. Moreover, nutrient inputs from their catchment represent a small fraction of their total nutrient loading. 3. Several independent studies carried out in this region have provided evidence of a decrease in primary productivity in some of these large tropical lakes due to climate change. The major process providing nutrients to the euphotic layer is internal loading, which has been reduced as warming of the surface waters has increased the temperature gradient and the water column stability. Moreover, reduced velocity of trade winds during the dry season has affected the mixed layer depth and decreased internal nutrient fluxes. Therefore, the trend for large tropical lakes in a warming climate is oligotrophication, not eutrophication. 4. In tropical South America, the rainfall increase is not the dominant scenario; thus, the predicted changes in plankton dynamics do not stand. 5. Therefore, we believe that the predictions presented in the paper for tropical systems under a changing climate are invalid for most tropical systems.",,,,"Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Amado, Andre/A-9906-2008; Amado, Andre/H-8727-2013","Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992; Amado, Andre/0000-0002-7736-8802; Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I003266/1],,,,16,17,1,62,,,,0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

World-wide declines in amphibian populations are often attributed to loss of habitat and exploitation; additionally, climate change may play an important role in future declines. Despite protection of habitat, amphibians relying on temporary habitats, such as vernal pools, may need active management to maintain their populations under forecasts of warming temperatures and more variable precipitation. However, few studies have examined the factors influencing where these species choose to breed (breeding occurrence) and the conditional likelihood of successful metamorphosis, while accounting for imperfect detection. 2. We developed an occupancy model and estimated parameters within a Bayesian framework to investigate the factors influencing probabilities of wood frog Lithobates sylvatica breeding and successful metamorphosis at Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland, USA. Our objectives were to obtain estimates of breeding occurrence and metamorph occupancy and evaluate the success of current management actions. 3. The probabilities of wood frog breeding and successful metamorphosis varied by year and were positively related to the pond's typical hydroperiod length and annual precipitation. Contrary to our predictions, previous occupancy states had little effect on breeding and metamorph occupancy probabilities, which is likely to be due to high correlation of occupancy with hydroperiod length. Additionally, we did not observe a relationship between breeding occupancy probabilities and the spatial arrangement of pools. Although sample sizes were small, management actions resulted in an increase in both breeding and metamorph occupancy probabilities. 4. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that management actions targeting short-hydroperiod pools favourably influence both components of breeding success. However, continued monitoring is needed to determine whether managed pools remain suitable for wood frogs. With predicted changes in climate and a positive relationship between breeding occupancy and winter precipitation, a proactive focus on active management of vernal pools may provide a means to maintain wood frog populations in the future.",,,,"Grant, Evan/N-5160-2014; Bailey, Larissa/A-2565-2009; Green, Adam/AAH-2892-2019","Grant, Evan/0000-0003-4401-6496; ",US Geological Survey ARMI,"We would like to thank all north-east Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) field personnel for the collection of the data and the Patuxent Research Refuge Youth Conservation Corps for assistance with installation of pool liners.

Understanding whether range shifts will be accompanied by increased exposure to other threats is crucial to predicting when and where new populations could successfully establish. If species overlap to a greater extent with human development under climate change, this could form ecological traps which are attractive to dispersing individuals, but the use of which substantially reduces fitness. Until recently, the core nesting range for the Critically Endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) was ca. 1000km of sparsely populated coastline in Tamaulipas, Mexico. Over the past twenty-five years, this species has expanded its range into populated areas of coastal Florida (>1500km outside the historical range), where nesting now occurs annually. Suitable Kemp's ridley nesting habitat has persisted for at least 140000years in the western Gulf of Mexico, and climate change models predict further nesting range expansion into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and northern Atlantic Ocean. Range expansion is 6-12% more likely to occur along uninhabited stretches of coastline than are current nesting beaches, suggesting that novel nesting areas will not be associated with high levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Although the high breeding-site fidelity of some migratory species could limit adaptation to climate change, rapid population recovery following effective conservation measures may enhance opportunities for range expansion. Anticipating the interactive effects of past or contemporary conservation measures, climate change, and future human activities will help focus long-term conservation strategies.",,,,,,,,,,19,20,4,220,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

It has been suggested that the use of ensemble forecasts, where a variety of model algorithms are used to generate consensus predictions, are preferred to individual SDMs by avoiding bias or prediction error inherent in a single modeling approach. Whereas several studies have assessed the performance of ensemble predictions using cross-validation or data-partitioning approaches, few studies have assessed the predictive accuracy of ensemble forecasts under climate change by using temporally independent model validation data. We used five SDM approaches to develop consensus forecasts of distributions of 145 vascular plant species from California in the 1930s and tested their projections against current distributions, a span of approximately 75 years. When evaluated with a portion of the model training data, consensus forecasts were highly accurate with an average AUC value of 0.97. False positive and false negative error rates were also low, exhibiting similar performance to random forest models. However, when evaluated with temporally independent data, the accuracy of consensus forecasts was similar to that of generalized linear and generalized additive models, with an average AUC value of 0.83. Our results suggest that the high levels of predictive accuracy exhibited by consensus forecasts when using data partitioning approaches may not reflect their performance when predicting temporally independent data. We contend that consensus forecasts may not represent the best approach for predicting species distributions under future climatic change, as they may not provide superior predictive accuracy in novel temporal domains compared to traditional modeling approaches that more readily lend themselves to ecological interpretation of model structure.

For this study, the AQUATOX model was implemented using 18 pelagic and benthic populations derived from field data obtained at Baiyangdian Lake between April 2009 and March 2010. The model was evaluated to examine its utility in assessing the ecological risk of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in aquatic ecosystems. Model parameters were calibrated to simulate the complex seasonal patterns of Baiyangdian Lake biomass populations. Sensitivity analysis revealed the potential importance of indirect effects and demonstrated the vital role of parameter values in determining the biomass of each trophic level. The model was highly sensitive to parameters related to temperature limitations and respiration rates. Moreover, it was effective in estimating risks associated with the direct toxic PCB effects of each population and the indirect ecological effects distributed through the coupled pelagic-benthic food web. Benchmarks derived from AQUATOX-Baiyangdian were approximately one order of magnitude less than the benchmarks derived from NOEC in a report by the United States of America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Comparison analysis determined the model could provide a good basis in ascertaining ecological protection levels of ""chemicals of concern"" for aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, AQUATOX can potentially be used to provide necessary information corresponding to early warning and rapid forecasting of pollutant transport and fate in the management of chemicals that put aquatic ecosystems at risk.

There are two different classes of adaptive explanation for associations between early-life adversity and accelerated reproduction, both based on the idea of predictive adaptive responses (PARs). According to external PAR hypotheses, early-life adversity provides a 'weather forecast' of the environmental conditions into which the individual will mature, and it is adaptive for the individual to develop an appropriate phenotype for this anticipated environment. In internal PAR hypotheses, early-life adversity has a lasting negative impact on the individual's somatic state, such that her health is likely to fail more rapidly as she gets older, and there is an advantage to adjusting her reproductive schedule accordingly. We use a model of fluctuating environments to derive evolveability conditions for acceleration of reproductive timing in response to early-life adversity in a long-lived organism. For acceleration to evolve via the external PAR process, early-life cues must have a high degree of validity and the level of annual autocorrelation in the individual's environment must be almost perfect. For acceleration to evolve via the internal PAR process requires that early-life experience must determine a significant fraction of the variance in survival prospects in adulthood. The two processes are not mutually exclusive, and mechanisms for calibrating reproductive timing on the basis of early experience could evolve through a combination of the predictive value of early-life adversity for the later environment and its negative impact on somatic state.",,,,,"Nettle, Daniel/0000-0001-9089-2599",,,,,113,115,5,159,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

I employ nearly a century of vegetation monitoring data from three North American deserts to demonstrate an approach to determine plant species responses to climate and critical points over a range of climatic conditions at which plant species shift from increases to decreases in abundance (climate pivot points). I assess these metrics from a site to regional scale and highlight how these indicators of plant performance can be modified by the physical and biotic environment. For example, shrubs were more responsive to drought and high temperatures on shallow soils with limited capacity to store water and fine-textured soils with slow percolation rates, whereas perennial grasses were more responsive to precipitation in sparse shrublands than in relatively dense grasslands and shrublands, where competition for water is likely more intense. The responses and associated climate pivot points of plant species aligned with their lifespan and structural characteristics, and the relationship between responses and climate pivot points provides evidence of the trade-off between the capacity of a plant species to increase in abundance when water is available and its drought resistance.",,,,,,"U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; Status and Trends Program; Climate and Land Use Program; Mendenhall Research Fellowship Program; National Park Service; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0080412, DEB-0620482, DEB0618210]; U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; University of Arizona, and data provided from Canyonlands and Arches National Parks","I thank Brad Butterfield, Dawn Browning, and Rick Meinzer for their critical reviews of earlier drafts of this paper and Heath Weaver for editorial assistance.

As a case-study, the dataset of Flanders was used, which consisted of 4289 samples containing mayflies (presences) and 3315 samples from waters where mayflies were never encountered (absences). For all techniques, data were randomly divided in a training set (two thirds) and a test set (one third). Models were calibrated using a tenfold cross-validation on the training set and subsequently validated using the test set. All techniques delivered good models that were able to discriminate sites with and without mayflies and performance (expressed as percent correctly classified instances and kappa-statistics) was in all cases similar for the training and the test set. Artificial neural networks and random forests performed slightly better compared to the other techniques. Samples with mayflies contained significantly more oxygen, a better developed river structure, higher values for sinuosity and steeper slopes, while samples without mayflies had significantly higher values for ammonium, nitrite, Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorous, orthophosphate, biological and chemical oxygen demand, pH and conductivity. Also land use differed significantly, with mayflies usually present in forests but absent in industrial areas. The prevalence of mayflies gradually increased during the nineties from about 20 to 40%, which corresponded with an improvement of the chemical water quality. During the last decade, however, water quality did not further improve and as a result, mayflies prevalence did not continue to increase. Based on the planned measures, an ensemble forecast using the five mentioned modelling techniques predicted that mayflies prevalence will increase to 46% by 2015 and to 72% by 2027. To meet the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive, which states that all surface waters should obtain a good ecological quality, extra efforts will be needed to decrease nutrient concentrations and to improve habitat quality.

Results on the reliability and usefulness of such models are missing in literature. The present study compares habitat suitability models for the invasive amphipod species Dikerogammarus villosus developed based on data gathered in recently invaded rivers and channels in Flanders (Belgium), with similar models developed on the basis of long-term colonised systems in Croatia. The models were tested on their reliability in both regions. Two techniques, logistic regressions (LR) and classification trees (CT) were used to analyse the habitat preference of this species based on physical-chemical and morphological habitat characteristics. It was found that in Flanders, D. villosus prefers rivers with a non-natural bank structure, high oxygen saturation, low conductivity and good chemical water quality, which could be related to its distribution in large rivers and canals. In Croatian rivers, high oxygen saturation was the most important prerequisite for the species to be present. Despite the longer history of invasion in Croatia, the species seemed to have similar habitat preferences in both invaded regions. Both data-driven approaches yielded similar results, but CT performed somewhat better based on the used performance criteria (% Correctly Classified Instances, Kappa and Area Under Curve) and were easier to interpret compared to the LR. The CT models developed based on the data of Flanders performed moderately when applying on the data of Croatia, but had a lower performance when applied vice versa. The LR models did not perform well when applying on a dataset of another geographic area. Extrapolation of the logistic regression model seemed to be more difficult compared to classification tree models. Our results indicate that it is possible to determine the habitat preference of an invasive species and that these models could be applied to other regions in Europe in order to take preventive measures to control the further spread of invasive species. However, a major concern is that the models are developed based on a representative range of all relevant variables reflecting the stream conditions and that accurate data are important.

Forage growth potential (FGP), the fraction of historical average production, is predicted as a weighted average of monthly precipitation from January through June. We calibrated and evaluated the DC tool in the Great Plains of the United States, using FGP and precipitation data from Colorado (CO), North Dakota (ND), and Wyoming (WY). In CO, FGP was most sensitive to precipitation in April and May, in ND to precipitation in April and June, and in WY to precipitation in April, May, and June. Weights in these months ranged from 0.16 to 0.52. Prediction was better for CO and WY than for ND. When January June precipitation was used, the tool correctly predicted 83% of the years with FGP reduced by drought for CO, 82% for WY, and only 67% for ND. Positive values of the True Skill Statistic (0.53 for CO, 0.42 for WY, and 0.17 for ND) indicate that FGP was classified as above or below average better than random selection. Predicting FGP earlier than April in CO and WY will require accurate forecasts of April June precipitation. Use of the DC is most limited by insufficient forage data to determine the site-specific relationships between FGP and monthly precipitation. Even so, the decision tool is useful for discriminating drought effects on FGP classification being above or below the long-term average, and it provides a quantitative prediction to producers for their destocking decisions in drought years.",,,,,"Green, Timothy/0000-0002-1441-8008",USDA-Risk Management Agency; National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research program (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0823405],"Research was funded in part by the USDA-Risk Management Agency.; Data sets for Colorado site were provided by the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research group, a partnership between Colorado State University, the US Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural Research Service, and the U.S. Forest Service Pawnee National Grassland.

We paired repeat measurements of plant canopy cover with climate at multiple sites across the Chihuahuan Desert over the last century to determine which plant species and functional types may be the most sensitive to climate change. We found that the dominant perennial grass, Bouteloua eriopoda, and species richness had nonlinear responses to summer precipitation, decreasing more in dry summers than increasing with wet summers. Dominant shrub species responded differently to the seasonality of precipitation and drought, but winter precipitation best explained changes in the cover of woody vegetation in upland grasslands and may contribute to woody-plant encroachment that is widespread throughout the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Temperature explained additional variability of changes in cover of dominant and subdominant plant species. Using a novel empirically based approach we identified climate pivot points that were indicative of shifts from increasing to decreasing plant cover over a range of climatic conditions. Reductions in cover of annual and several perennial plant species, in addition to declines in species richness below the long-term summer precipitation mean across plant communities, indicate a decrease in the productivity for all but the most drought-tolerant perennial grasses and shrubs in the Chihuahuan Desert.

However, models often fail when extended to new locales, and such instances have been used as evidence of a change in physiological tolerance, that is, a fundamental niche shift. We explore an alternative explanation and propose a method for predicting the likelihood of failure based on physiological performance curves and environmental variance in the original and new environments. We define the transient event margin (TEM) as the gap between energetic performance failure, defined as CTmax, and the upper lethal limit, defined as LTmax. If TEM is large relative to environmental fluctuations, models will likely fail in new locales. If TEM is small relative to environmental fluctuations, models are likely to be robust for new locales, even when mechanism is unknown. Using temperature, we predict when biogeographic models are likely to fail and illustrate this with a case study. We suggest that failure is predictable from an understanding of how climate drives nonlethal physiological responses, but for many species such data have not been collected. Successful biogeographic forecasting thus depends on understanding when the mechanisms limiting distribution of a species will differ among geographic regions, or at different times, resulting in realized niche shifts.

However, ENMs do not directly account for important biological and landscape processes likely to affect range dynamics at a variety of spatial scales. Recent advances to link ENMs with population models have focused on the fundamental step of integrating dispersal and metapopulation dynamics into forecasts of species geographic ranges. Here we use a combination of novel analyses and a synthesis of findings from published plant and animal case studies to highlight three seldom recognised, yet important, advantages of linking ENMs with demographic modelling approaches: 1) they provide direct measures of extinction risk in addition to measures of vulnerability based on change in the potential range area or total habitat suitability. 2) They capture life-history traits that permit population density to vary in different ways in response to key spatial drivers, conditioned by the processes of global change. 3) They can be used to explore and rank the cost effectiveness of regional conservation alternatives and demographically oriented management interventions. Given these advantages, we argue that coupled methods should be used preferentially where data permits and when conservation management decisions require intervention, prioritization, or direct estimates of extinction risk.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013; Akcakaya, H.

One strategy to improve forecasts is to evaluate how species responded to climatic variation in the past. We used 22 years of capture-recapture data for Sonoran desert tortoises (Gopherus morafkai) collected from 15 locations across their geographic range in Arizona to evaluate how environmental factors affected spatial and temporal variation in survival. Although rates of annual survival were generally high ( = 0.92), survival of adults decreased with drought severity, especially in portions of their range that were most arid and nearest to cities. In three locations where large numbers of carcasses from marked tortoises were recovered, survival of adults was markedly lower during periods of severe drought ( = 0.77-0.81) compared to all other periods ( = 0.93-0.98). Assuming continued levels of dependency of humans on fossil fuels, survival of adult tortoises is predicted to decrease by an average of 3 % during 2035-2060 relative to survival during 1987-2008 in 14 of the 15 populations we studied.

However, predictions regarding parasitism's impacts often fail to account for the likely variability in host distribution and how this may alter parasite occurrence. Here, we investigate potential distributional shifts in the meningeal worm, Parelaphostrongylosis tenuis, a protostrongylid nematode commonly found in white-tailed deer in North America, whose life cycle also involves a free-living stage and a gastropod intermediate host. We modelled the distribution of the hosts and free-living larva as a complete assemblage to assess whether a complex trophic system will lead to an overall increase in parasite distribution with climate change, or whether divergent environmental niches may promote an ecological mismatch. Using an ensemble approach to climate modelling under two different carbon emission scenarios, we show that whereas the overall trend is for an increase in niche breadth for each species, mismatches arise in habitat suitability of the free-living larva vs. the definitive and intermediate hosts. By incorporating these projected mismatches into a combined model, we project a shift in parasite distribution accounting for all steps in the transmission cycle, and identify that overall habitat suitability of the parasite will decline in the Great Plains and southeastern USA, but will increase in the Boreal Forest ecoregion, particularly in Alberta. These results have important implications for wildlife conservation and management due to the known pathogenicity of parelaphostrongylosis to alternate hosts including moose, caribou and elk. Our results suggest that disease risk forecasts which fail to consider biotic interactions may be overly simplistic, and that accounting for each of the parasite's life stages is key to refining predicted responses to climate change.",,,,,,Canadian Bureau of International Education,This research was funded by a postdoctoral research fellowship awarded to R.S.A.

Bioclimatic envelope model predictions of current and future distributions were contrasted with those from models that used biotic indicators of suitable habitat as predictors rather than climate. Location Temperate grassy woodlands of South Australia. Methods We modelled the distribution of two native grassland plant species, key habitat indicators of the endangered and geographically restricted pygmy bluetongue lizard (Tiliqua adelaidensis), using climate and landscape variables with aggregated boosted regression trees. We forecast annual changes in the plant species distributions from 2000 to 2100 under a no-climate-policy ` Reference' scenario (high global greenhouse gas emissions) and a climate stabilization 'Policy' scenario. We compared current and future predicted distributions of the lizard estimated directly using bioclimatic envelope models with those derived indirectly from climate-driven changes in habitat suitability of the grassland plant species with which the lizard has a strong association (termed plant-habitat models). Results Both coupled plant-habitat models and bioclimatic envelope models described the current distribution of the pygmy bluetongue lizard almost equally well; however, future projections of changes in the species range were markedly more pessimistic (i. e. greater range contraction) for bioclimatic envelope models. Further, bioclimatic envelope models that included interactions among variables projected rapid increases in area of occupancy that are unlikely to be attainable given dispersal constraints, but no such increases were projected from plant-habitat models.

The development of predictive models is still not only an actual unsolved problem of mathematical epidemiology but also is very important for safety of public health. Here we show that SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model accurately enough reproduces real curves of flu activity. It contains variable reaction rate, which is a function of mean daily temperature. The proposed alternation of variables represents SIRS equations as the second-order ODE with an outer excitation. It reveals an origin of such predictive efficiency and explains analytically the 1:1 dynamical resonance, which is known as a crucial property of epidemic behavior. Our work opens the perspectives for the development of instant short-time prediction of a normal level of flu activity based on the weather forecast, and allows to estimate a current epidemic level more precisely. The latter fact is based on the explicit difference between the expected weather-based activity and instant anomalies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Location Atlantic Ocean and Global Ocean Methods Using phytoplankton size composition data, nutrient concentrations (nitrite+nitrate, phosphate, and silicate), irradiance, temperature and zooplankton abundances of the Atlantic Meridional Transect programme, we derived and tested an environmental classification method of phytoplankton size distribution with a k-means clustering technique. We then used principal component and Dirichlet multivariate regression analyses to disentangle the relative influence of different environmental conditions on the phytoplankton size composition. Subsequently, we evaluated different probabilisitic models and selected the most parsimonious one to estimate the global phytoplankton size distributions in the world oceans based on global climatology data of the World Ocean Atlas 2009. Results Based only on prevailing environmental conditions and without a priori knowledge concerning, for example, the position of oceanic fronts, the primary productivity, the distribution of organisms or any geographical information, our classification method captures the size structures of phytoplankton communities across the Atlantic. We find a strong influence of temperature and nitrite+nitrate concentration on the prevalence of the different size classes, and we present evidence that both factors may act independently on structuring phytoplankton communities. While at low nitrite+nitrate concentrations temperature has a major structuring impact, at high nitrite+nitrate concentrations its influence is reduced. Finally, we show that the global distribution of phytoplankton community size structure can be predicted by a probabilistic model based only on temperature and nitrite+nitrate.

Although behavioral plasticity has buffered some species against HIREC, maladaptive behavioral scenarios called 'evolutionary traps' are increasingly common, threatening the persistence of affected species. Here, we review examples of evolutionary traps to identify their anthropogenic causes, behavioral mechanisms, and evolutionary bases, and to better forecast forms of HIREC liable to trigger traps. We summarize a conceptual framework for explaining the susceptibility of animals to traps that integrates the cost benefit approach of standard behavioral ecology with an evolutionary approach (reaction norms) to understanding cue response systems (signal detection). Finally, we suggest that a significant revision of conceptual thinking in wildlife conservation and management is needed to effectively eliminate and mitigate evolutionary traps.",,,,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",Bard College; Smithsonian Conservation Biology InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [WSC-1204762]; Florida Coastal Everglades Long-term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program [NSF DBI-0620409],B.A.R. was supported by funding from Bard College and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.

We investigated the impact and the interplay of future (2050) climate and land use change on plant diversity in Burkina Faso, which covers the major bioclimatic gradient in West Africa. Thus, regions with different levels of species richness can be investigated. The LandSHIFT model was adapted for this study to derive novel future (2050) land use simulations. One-class support vector machines (SVMs) were performed with these land use simulations together with current and future (2050) climate projections at a 0.1 degrees resolution. Our modeling results show that the flora of Burkina Faso will be primarily negatively impacted by future climate and land use changes. However, we found contrasting latitudinal patterns. The more humid regions in Southern Burkina Faso would be more affected in terms of species loss than the Sahel. Climate change is more important than land use change under the assumption of technological stagnation in the agricultural sector. Our results suggest that, in general, the plant diversity in dry and humid regions of the tropics might respond differently to climate and land use change. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As surface elevation change did not differ significantly from accretion over the 10 year study period in the mangrove and saltmarsh (p = 0.4104), the accretion model was regarded as a reliable estimate of elevation change. Using the current rate of sea-level rise (3.65 mm y(-1)), a rate deemed to be relatively moderate, a landscape elevation model was developed by applying the accretion model to a LiDAR-derived digital elevation model at annual increments to 2050. Based on current rates of sea-level rise and the intertidal elevation that currently supports mangrove and saltmarsh, the landscape elevation model projected a 16% increase in the area within the elevation range suitable to support mangrove and saltmarsh. This contrasts 'bathtub modelling', which projected a 6% decline in wetland extent. Bathtub modelling fails to account for the ability of mangrove and saltmarsh to accommodate sea-level rise through processes of accretion, shrink-swell of sediments and the accumulation of organic material. Results from the landscape elevation model suggest that planning for sea-level rise should be directed towards facilitating wetland adaptation by promoting tidal exchange to mangrove and saltmarsh and providing land for wetland migration.

Marine and coastal ecosystems are highly susceptible to the impacts of global climate change and also produce significant ecosystem services. The effects of global climate change on coastal and marine ecosystems involve a much wider array of effects than the usual temperature, sea level rise, and precipitation. This paper is an overview for a collection of 12 papers that examined various aspects of global climate change on marine ecosystems and comprise this special issue. We summarized the major features of the models and analyses in the papers to determine general patterns. A wide range of ecosystems were simulated using a diverse set of modeling approaches. Models were either 3-dimensional or used a few spatial boxes, and responses to global climate change were mostly expressed as changes from a baseline condition. Three issues were identified from the across-model comparison: (a) lack of standardization of climate change scenarios, (b) the prevalence of site-specific and even unique models for upper trophic levels, and (c) emphasis on hypothesis evaluation versus forecasting. We discuss why these issues are important as global climate change assessment continues to progress up the food chain, and, when possible, offer some initial steps for going forward.

It identifies farmland bird trends and uses them as a proxy for wider farmland biodiversity health. This study analyzed the potential impacts of future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) land uses on the abundances of the 20 farmland bird species included in the French FBI. Four agricultural policy scenarios were studied using the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact analysis (CAPRI) agricultural model. These four scenarios describe the most likely changes in crop areas and include regional bird population data from the French Breeding Bird Survey. A habitat association model was used to predict the potential effects that changes to five crop categories, as well as the total arable area, would have on species indices and the FBI. Our study demonstrates that the relative abundances of specialist farmland bird species depend on both crop cover type and the total crop area. Model predictions show a general decline in the abundance of farmland birds between 2007 and 2020. However, the loss of farmland birds is predicted to be less pronounced in the 'CAP Greening' scenario, although the predicted FBI values have relatively large errors. Moreover, whatever the forecasted CAP, such uniform agricultural changes do not affect bird populations or the FBI equally across all regions. The FBI's geographical variability in response to applied agricultural changes clearly indicates that a nationwide policy will not yield equal results but will instead depend on where in the country the agricultural changes occur. To optimize the effectiveness of the CAP on biodiversity at the national and continental levels, policies should be tested at smaller spatial levels, such as regions or farmlands, and then, the policies that represent the best options for biodiversity at these sublevels should be combined to create a national plan.

Partitioning anthropogenic impacts among species that have positive versus negative effects on plants may improve our ability to forecast the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these alterations in communities. Here, we manipulated the distance of populations of a wild sunflower species (Helianthus annuus texanus) to fields of its domesticated relative (crop sunflowers, H. annuus) and contrasted subsequent shifts in the abundance and community composition of mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (seed predators, folivores) of H. a. texanus. With some exceptions, populations of H. a. texanus near crop sunflowers supported higher numbers of pollinators than those far from crop sunflowers. In contrast, in the majority of cases, populations of H. a. texanus supported more seed predators when located far from crop sunflowers. Folivore damage to plants was greater far from crop sunflowers, and was never greater near crop sunflowers. Contrary to the prediction that proximity to agriculture homogenizes community composition, we found beta-diversity of pollinators (species turnover between populations) was greater near crop sunflowers. Our results demonstrate that mutualists and antagonists of a wild plant species respond differently to the proximity of a related crop species, indicating the potential for both altered population dynamics and complex selection pressures on wild species in agricultural landscapes.",,,,"Whitney, Kenneth D/B-2971-2011","Whitney, Kenneth D/0000-0002-2523-5469",Prairie Biotic Research; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0716868]; Wiess Career Development Chair at Rice University,"We thank the following people for field and lab assistance: Toby Liss, Charles Danan, Morgan Black, and Wael Al Wawi.

Effective management and conservation plans require advances in the accuracy and reliability of species distribution forecasts. Here, we forecast distribution shifts of Salmo trutta based on environmental predictors and examine the effect of using different statistical techniques and varying geographical extents on the performance and extrapolation of the models obtained. Location Watercourses of Ebro, Elbe and Danube river basins (c. 1,041,000 km(2); Mediterranean and temperate climates, Europe). Methods The occurrence of S. trutta and variables of climate, land cover and stream topography were assigned to stream reaches. Data obtained were used to build correlative species distribution models (SDMs) and forecasts for future decades (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under the A1b emissions scenario, using four statistical techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression). Results The SDMs showed an excellent performance. Climate was a better predictor than stream topography, while land cover characteristics were not necessary to improve performance. Forecasts predict the distribution of S. trutta to become increasingly restricted over time. The geographical extent of data had a weak impact on model performance and gain/loss values, but better species response curves were generated using data from all three basins collectively. By 2080, 64% of the stream reaches sampled will be unsuitable habitats for S. trutta, with Elbe basin being the most affected, and virtually no new habitats will be gained in any basin. Main conclusions More reliable predictions are obtained when the geographical data used for modelling approximate the environmental range where the species is present.

However, BEMs are widely applied and have proven to be often useful. Here we investigate, under which conditions evolution of dispersal, local adaptation or interspecific competition may be of minor importance for forecasting future range shifts. Therefore we use individual-based simulations of metapopulations under climate change living in spatial temperature gradients. Scenarios incorporate single-species systems or systems with competing species, respectively. Dispersal rate is evolving and adaptation to local conditions may also evolve in some scenarios. Results show that in single-species scenarios excluding evolutionary adaptation, species either follow optimal habitat conditions or go extinct if habitat connectivity is too low. These simulations are in close accordance to predictions from BEMs. Including evolutionary adaptation qualitatively changes these results. In the absence of competing species the species either completely invades the world or goes extinct. With competitors, results strongly depend on habitat fragmentation. For highly connected habitats the range border may shift as predicted by BEMs, for intermediate connectivity it will lag behind, while species will go extinct if fragmentation is too high. Our results indicate that (simple) BEMs may work well if habitats are well connected and species will not encounter many difficulties in dispersing to new sites. Selection in this case may promote evolution of even higher dispersal activities. We thus show that the presence of biotic interactions may be ignored for predictions of range shifts when high dispersal can be expected.",,,,"Kubisch, Alexander/C-2103-2015","Kubisch, Alexander/0000-0003-1303-4245; Hovestadt, Thomas/0000-0001-7368-6013",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG PO 244/4-1]; project CLIMIT; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR),"AK was supported by a grant from the German Science Foundation (DFG PO 244/4-1), TH within project CLIMIT (Settele and Kuhn 2009) funded by ANR through the FP6 BiodivERsA Eranet.",,,30,30,2,107,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2013,36,8,,,,,873,882,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.00062.x,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000321328100004,,,,,

By the end of the last century, the distribution range of Microtus arvalis in NW Spain greatly expanded to encompass agricultural habitats, with the appearance of crop damaging population outbreaks. The absence of long term vole monitoring data has so far precluded outbreak forecasting, which might help mitigating associated bioeconomic costs. We used non-standard and diverse sources of information, including newspaper and national technical reports, to describe the vole expansion and outbreak dynamics in NW Spain since the late 1960s. We illustrate a rapid (<20 years) and large scale (ca. 5 million ha) colonisation of agricultural lowlands, and suggest a pattern of westward expansion emanating from the peripheral mountains. Crop damaging outbreaks directly followed range expansion and our analyses indicate that they have occurred at approximately 5-year intervals since the early 1980s. This is the first description of long term (>40 years) regional scale vole dynamics reported for the Iberian Peninsula.

We aim to compare suitability and productivity estimates for a well-understood crop species to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of mechanistic versus empirical modelling. Location South Africa. Methods We compared four habitat suitability models for dryland maize based on climate and soil predictors. Two were created using maximum entropy (MAXENT), the first based on national crop distribution points and the second based only on locations with high productivity. The third approach used a generalized additive model (GAM) trained with continuous productivity data derived from the satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The fourth model was a mechanistic crop growth model (DSSAT) made spatially explicit. We tested model accuracy by comparing the results with observed productivity derived from MODIS NDVI and with observed suitability based on the current spatial distribution of maize crop fields. Results The GAM and DSSAT results were linearly correlated to NDVI-measured yield (R-2 = 0.75 and 0.37, respectively). MAXENT suitability values were not linearly related to yield (R-2 = 0.08); however, a MAXENT model based on occurrences of high-productivity maize was linearly related to yield (R-2 = 0.62). All models produced crop suitability maps of similarly good accuracy (Kappa = 0.73-75). Main conclusions These findings suggest that empirical models can achieve the same or better accuracy as mechanistic models for predicting both suitability (i.e. species range) and productivity (i.e. species abundance). While MAXENT could not predict productivity across the species range when trained on all occurrences, it could when trained with a high-productivity subset, suggesting that ecological niche models can be adjusted to better correlate with species abundance.",,,,"Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008; Hole, David/Q-1692-2019","Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971; Tadross, Mark/0000-0002-7018-404X",Princeton Environmental Institute's Grand Challenges Program,"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Princeton Environmental Institute's Grand Challenges Program.

The health of managed and wild honeybee colonies appears to have declined substantially in Europe and the United States over the last decade. Sustainability of honeybee colonies is important not only for honey production, but also for pollination of crops and wild plants alongside other insect pollinators. A combination of causal factors, including parasites, pathogens, land use changes and pesticide usage, are cited as responsible for the increased colony mortality. 2. However, despite detailed knowledge of the behaviour of honeybees and their colonies, there are no suitable tools to explore the resilience mechanisms of this complex system under stress. Empirically testing all combinations of stressors in a systematic fashion is not feasible. We therefore suggest a cross-level systems approach, based on mechanistic modelling, to investigate the impacts of (and interactions between) colony and land management. 3. We review existing honeybee models that are relevant to examining the effects of different stressors on colony growth and survival. Most of these models describe honeybee colony dynamics, foraging behaviour or honeybee - varroa mite - virus interactions. 4. We found that many, but not all, processes within honeybee colonies, epidemiology and foraging are well understood and described in the models, but there is no model that couples in-hive dynamics and pathology with foraging dynamics in realistic landscapes. 5. Synthesis and applications. We describe how a new integrated model could be built to simulate multifactorial impacts on the honeybee colony system, using building blocks from the reviewed models. The development of such a tool would not only highlight empirical research priorities but also provide an important forecasting tool for policy makers and beekeepers, and we list examples of relevant applications to bee disease and landscape management decisions.",,,,"Osborne, Juliet/I-6776-2012",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the UKBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Syngenta; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H00114X/1],This review was written as part of an Industrial Partnership Award cofunded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the UK and Syngenta.,,,84,85,85,728,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Because of potential losses to ecosystem services, forecasting such unexpected shifts would be valuable. Using mathematical models of regime shifts, ecologists have proposed various early warning signals of imminent shifts. However, their generality and applicability to real ecosystems remain unclear because these mathematical models are considered too simplistic. Here, we investigate the robustness of recently proposed early warning signals of regime shifts in two well-studied ecological models, but with the inclusion of time-delayed processes. We find that the average variance may either increase or decrease prior to a regime shift and, thus, may not be a robust leading indicator in time-delayed ecological systems. In contrast, changing average skewness, increasing autocorrelation at short time lags, and reddening power spectra of time series of the ecological state variable all show trends consistent with those of models with no time delays.

These factors make difficult the development of quantitative tools to design and evaluate different management strategies performances by taking into account various form of variability and uncertainty. Pest management could benefit from methods supporting decision making based on models ease of development under scarce data and high uncertainty. Host plants for many agricultural and forest pests are often patchily distributed, therefore population dynamics can be suitably described in terms of metapopulations. Despite the fact that metapopulation models were originally proposed for pests, they remain a widely used tool in conservation biology but receive little attention in large scale pest management. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework allowing the ranking of the efficacy of area-wide pest control strategies, taking into account population spatial distribution in discrete patches. The Kullback-Leibler divergence, well known in Information Theory, Probability and Statistics, is used to measure how far the state of the metapopulation as predicted by a spatially explicit metapopulation model is from a suitable reference state. The method is applied to compare the efficacy of different types of predefined control strategies of the Pine processionary moth (Traumatocampa pityocampa (Den. and Schiff)). The analysis of a dataset on metapopulation dynamics of this moth from a fragmented Mediterranean pine forest allows to derive some rules of thumb for the rational allocation of control effort, in terms of spatial and temporal distribution of the interventions.

We used a multispecies model to predict which processes and species' responses are likely to drive shifts in the composition of a space-limited benthic marine community. Our model was parametrized from experimental manipulations of the community. Model simulations indicated shifts in species dominance patterns as temperatures increase, with projected shifts in composition primarily owing to the temperature dependence of growth, mortality and competition for three critical species. By contrast, warming impacts on two other species (rendering them weaker competitors for space) and recruitment rates of all species were of lesser importance in determining projected community changes. Our analysis reveals the importance of temperature-dependent competitive interactions for predicting effects of changing climate on such communities. Furthermore, by identifying processes and species that could disproportionately leverage shifts in community composition, our results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of climate change impacts, thereby allowing more insightful predictions of future biodiversity patterns.",,,,,,AAUW American Fellowship; California Ocean Protection Council [DOE-ER64982]; Bodega Marine Laboratory,"We thank M.

Results: Maximum resting metabolism and metabolic breadth were significantly different, but optimal temperature was similar, between treatments. Thus, increases in ambient thermal variability caused a reduction in maximum performance at each level of acclimation, with a decrease of almost 50% between the nil variability and +/- 8 degrees C daily variability treatments.

However, an increased understanding of temperature and precipitation influences on cattle weight gains is needed to optimize stocking rates and reduce enterprise risk associated with climatic variability. Yearling steer weight gain data collected at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station at light, moderate, and heavy stocking rates for 30 years (1982-2011) were used to examine the effects of spring (April-June) and summer (July-September) temperature and precipitation, as well as prior-growing-season (prior April-September) and fall/winter (October-March) precipitation, on beef production (kg . ha(-1)). At heavier stocking rates, steer production was more sensitive to seasonal weather variations. A novel finding was that temperature (relatively cool springs and warm summers) played a large predictive role on beef production. At heavier stocking rates, beef production was highest during years with cool, wet springs and warm, wet summers, corresponding to optimum growth conditions for this mixed C-3-C-4 plant community. The novelty and utility of these findings may increase the efficacy of stocking rate decision support tools. The parsimonious model structure presented here includes three-month seasonal clusters that are forecasted and freely available from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration up to a year in advance.

While the inclusion of physical disturbances into models of species geographic ranges is widely recommended, no studies have yet tested the utility of field-quantified geomorphological disturbances for terrestrial species distribution modelling. Here we apply generalized additive models and boosted regression trees to examine if the explicit inclusion of terrestrial and fluvial geomorphological variables alters species distribution models for 154 vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species in north European mountain tundra. The inclusion of these disturbances significantly improved both the explanatory and predictive power of distribution models, with consistent results for all three species groups. Spatial distribution predictions changed considerably for some species after the inclusion of disturbance variables, with fluvial disturbances generating strongly linear features for species influenced by erosion or sediment deposition. As a consequence, models incorporating geomorphological variables produced markedly more refined distribution maps than simpler models. Predictions of species distributions will thus benefit strongly from the inclusion of fine-scale geomorphological variables, particularly in areas of active earth surface processes, enabling more accurate forecasting of future species ranges under changing conditions.",,,,"Virtanen, Risto/G-1810-2010; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011; Luoto, Miska/E-6693-2014","Virtanen, Risto/0000-0002-8295-8217; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [1140873],We acknowledge funding from the Academy of Finland (project no. 1140873).,,,28,28,1,58,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JUL,2013,36,7,,,,,800,808,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07922.x,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000320468900006,,,,,

The recent development of metapopulation modeling allows the estimation of dispersal kernels based on the colonization pattern but the accuracy of these estimates compared with direct estimates of the seed dispersal kernel has rarely been assessed. In this study, we used recent genetic methods based on parentage analysis (spatially explicit mating models) to estimate seed and pollen dispersal kernels as well as seed and pollen immigration in fragmented urban populations of the plant species Crepis sancta with contrasting patch dynamics. Using two independent networks, we documented substantial seed immigration and a highly restricted dispersal kernel. Moreover, immigration heterogeneity among networks was consistent with previously reported metapopulation dynamics, showing that colonization was mainly due to external colonization in the first network (propagule rain) and local colonization in the second network. We concluded that the differences in urban patch dynamics are mainly due to seed immigration heterogeneity, highlighting the importance of external population source in the spatio-temporal dynamics of plants in a fragmented landscape.

However, the key determinants of mangrove species distribution across the intertidal zone are not well understood. We aimed to quantify the relationship between species' dominance and the hydroperiod (defined as the duration of inundation in a year), soil salinity and the salinity of inundating water for three dominant species, Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora stylosa and Ceriops tagal. Location An extensive (20,000 ha), largely intact mangrove forest in northern Australia, of some note as mangrove forests are threatened globally. Methods We related species dominance to the explanatory variables by applying two statistical modelling approaches: generalized linear models (GLMs), where a set of competing models were evaluated; and boosted regression tree models (BRTs), an approach that automatically captures interactions and nonlinear relationships between variables. Results Both GLM and BRT models achieved strong predictive performance for all species based on cross-validation, with receiver operating characteristics above 0.85 for all species, and 88% of deviance explained for S.alba, 42% for R.stylosa and 35% for C.tagal. All models indicated that the hydroperiod was the key variable influencing distribution, followed by soil salinity. The salinity of inundating water was the least informative variable in the models. Ecological space, determined by gradients in hydroperiod and soil salinity, was partitioned between the three species with little overlap.

The effort to identify universal characteristics that predict which species become invasive has faltered in part because of the diversity of taxa and systems considered. Here, we use an alternative approach focused on the spread stage of invasions. F-ST, a measure of alternative fixation of alleles, is a common proxy for realized dispersal among natural populations, summarizing the combined influences of life history, behaviour, habitat requirements, population size, history and ecology. We test the hypothesis that population structure in the native range (FST) is negatively correlated with the geographical extent of spread of marine species in an introduced range. An analysis of the available data (29 species, nine phyla) revealed a significant negative correlation (R-2 = 0.245-0.464) between FST and the extent of spread of non-native species. Mode FST among pairwise comparisons between populations in the native range demonstrated the highest predictive power (R-2 = 0.464, p < 0.001). There was significant improvement when marker type was considered, with mtDNA datasets providing the strongest relationship (n = 21, R-2 = 0.333-0.516). This study shows that FST can be used to make qualitative predictions concerning the geographical extent to which a non-native marine species will spread once established in a new area.",,,,"Gaither, Michelle/J-3137-2015; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019","Gaither, Michelle/0000-0002-0371-5621; Toonen, Rob/0000-0001-6339-4340","University of Hawai'i Sea [NA05OAR4171048]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA0554657, OCE-0929031, OCE-1260169]; NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries Program (MOA) [2005-008/66882]; University of Hawai'i Sea Grant Program [UNIHI-SEAGRANT-JC-10-35]","This study was supported by University of Hawai'i Sea Grant no.

Understanding these dynamics and a population's sensitivity to them informs conservation planning, policy decisions, recovery criteria and management triggers, especially when management actions are expensive or risky. Therefore, to inform management and conservation of the only wild, migratory population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana), we modeled its 73-year time-series of abundances and simulated future growth using Monte Carlo forecasting. We estimated the probability of the population reaching downlisting criteria. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine this population's sensitivity to periods of negative growth (i.e., annual growth rate (r) = -0.025, -0.050, -0.100, or -0.150 for 1-3 consecutive years). We found this population exhibiting periodic declines on a 10-year cycle. We show it is unlikely to go extinct assuming conditions remain similar to the past. Our forecasts suggested the population will contain >400 birds by 2025. We found >= 3 consecutive years of r <= -0.1 or >= 2 consecutive years of r <= -0.15 must occur to significantly reduce abundance from the current trajectory and delay recovery. Favorably, the probability of reaching 400 birds by 2040 was 0.892 for the worst scenario. Such a scenario has only occurred once in 73 years of monitoring. Our simulations provide managers and policy makers information for evaluating recovery timelines, while forecasts aid setting habitat conservation targets. By describing how the population responds to periods of negative growth (natural or manmade), we identify management triggers, while informing monitoring frequency. Furthermore, our analyses pro: vide a framework for moving discussions away from short-term, reactive decisions such as supplemental feeding, aquaculture, or small-scale freshwater provisioning, to long-term conservation approaches.

Carr.) with hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae) has caused widespread mortality of this key canopy species throughout much of the southern Appalachian Mountains in the past decade. Because eastern hemlock is heavily concentrated in riparian habitats, maintains a dense canopy, and has an evergreen leaf habit, its loss is expected to have a major impact on forest processes, including transpiration (E-t). Our goal was to estimate changes in stand-level E-t since HWA infestation, and predict future effects of forest regeneration on forest E-t in declining eastern hemlock stands where hemlock represented 50-60% of forest basal area. We used a combination of community surveys, sap flux measurements, and empirical models relating sap flux-scaled leaf-level transpiration (E-L) to climate to estimate the change in E-t after hemlock mortality and forecast how forest E-t will change in the future in response to eastern hemlock loss. From 2004 to 2011, eastern hemlock mortality reduced annual forest E-t by 22% and reduced winter E-t by 74%. As hemlock mortality increased, growth of deciduous tree species-especially sweet birch (Betula lenta L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), and the evergreen understory shrub rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum L.)-also increased, and these species will probably dominate post-hemlock riparian forests. All of these species have higher daytime E-L rates than hemlock, and replacement of hemlock with species that have less conservative transpiration rates will result in rapid recovery of annual stand E-t. Further, we predict that annual stand E-t will eventually surpass E-t levels observed before hemlock was infested with HWA. This long-term increase in forest E-t may eventually reduce stream discharge, especially during the growing season. However, the dominance of deciduous species in the canopy will result in a permanent reduction in winter E-t and possible increase in winter stream discharge. The effects of hemlock die-off and replacement with deciduous species will have a significant impact on the hydrologic flux of forest transpiration, especially in winter. These results highlight the impact that invasive species can have on landscape-level ecosystem fluxes.",,,,,"Miniat, Chelcy/0000-0002-3266-9783","USDA Forest Service, Southern Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0218001, DEB0823293]","This study was supported by the USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station and by NSF grants DEB0218001 and DEB0823293 to the Coweeta LTER program at the University of Georgia.

Bioclimatic niche models provide compelling evidence that many species will experience range shifts under scenarios of global change, yet these broad, macroecological perspectives lack specificity at local scales, where unique combinations of environment, biota, and history conspire against generalizations. We explored how these idiosyncrasies of place affect the climate-distribution relationship of the American pika (Ochotona princeps) by replicating intensive field surveys across bioclimatic gradients in eight U.S. national parks. At macroecological scales, the importance of climate as a constraint on pika distribution appears unequivocal; forecasts suggest that the species' range will contract sharply in coming decades. However, the species persists outside of its modeled bioclimatic envelope in many locations, fueling uncertainty and debate over its conservation status. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we modeled variation in local patterns of pika distribution along topographic position, vegetation cover, elevation, temperature, and precipitation gradients in each park landscape. We also accounted for annual turnover in site occupancy probabilities. Topographic position and vegetation cover influenced occurrence in all parks. After accounting for these factors, pika occurrence varied widely among parks along bioclimatic gradients. Precipitation by itself was not a particularly influential predictor. However, measures of heat stress appeared most influential in the driest parks, suggesting an interaction between the strength of climate effects and the position of parks along precipitation gradients. The combination of high elevation, cold temperatures, and high precipitation lowered occurrence probabilities in some parks, suggesting an upper elevational limit for pikas in some environments. Our results demonstrate that the idiosyncrasies of place influence both the nature and strength of the climate-distribution relationship for the American pika. Fine-grained, but geographically extensive, studies replicated across multiple landscapes offer insights important to assessing the impacts of climate change that otherwise may be masked at macroecological scales. The hierarchical approach to modeling provides a coherent conceptual and technical framework for gaining these insights.",,,,"Ray, Chris/AAI-1002-2019","Ray, Chris/0000-0002-7963-9637; Rodhouse, Thomas/0000-0001-5953-9113",National Park Service Climate Change Response Program; U.S. Geological Survey Park-Oriented Biological Support (POBS) Program [G11AC20397],"We are extremely grateful to all of the National Park Service staff and cooperators, university researchers, and field technicians who have contributed to this project.

To plan efficient climate change mitigation programs (such as REDD+, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), reliable forecasts of deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions are necessary. Although population density has been recognized as a key factor in tropical deforestation, current methods of prediction do not allow the population explosion that is occurring in many tropical developing countries to be taken into account. Here, we propose an innovative approach using novel computational and statistical tools, including R/GRASS scripts and the new phcfM R package, to model the intensity and location of deforestation including the effect of population density. We used the model to forecast anthropogenic deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions in five large study areas in the humid and spiny-dry forests of Madagascar. Using our approach, we were able to demonstrate that the current rapid population growth in Madagascar (+3.39% per year) will significantly increase the intensity of deforestation by 2030 (up to +1.17% per year in densely populated areas). We estimated the carbon dioxide emissions associated with the loss of aboveground biomass to be of 2.24 and 0.26 tons per hectare and per year in the humid and spiny-dry forest, respectively. Our models showed better predictive ability than previous deforestation models (the figure of merit ranged from 10 to 23). We recommend this approach to reduce the uncertainty associated with deforestation forecasts. We also underline the risk of an increase in the speed of deforestation in the short term in tropical developing countries undergoing rapid population expansion.",,,,"Vieilledent, Ghislain/D-8323-2011","Vieilledent, Ghislain/0000-0002-1685-4997; Grinand, Clovis/0000-0003-2650-2829",Cirad; Air France,"Support for this research work was provided by Cirad.

Despite the potential pitfalls of this approach, few historically based population models have been experimentally validated. We conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment to test population models fit to observational data collected from the 1930s to the 1970s for six prairie forb species. We used the historical population models to predict experimental responses to the precipitation manipulations, and compared these predictions to ones generated by a statistical model fit directly to the experimental data. For three species, a sensitivity analysis of the effects of precipitation and grass cover on forb population growth showed consistent results for the historical population models and the contemporary statistical models. Furthermore, the historical population models predicted population growth rates in the experimental plots as well or better than the statistical models, ignoring variation explained by spatial random effects and local density-dependence. However, for the remaining three species, the sensitivity analyses showed that the historical and statistical models predicted opposite effects of precipitation on population growth, and the historical models were very poor predictors of experimental responses. For these species, historical observations were not well replicated in space, and for two of them the historical precipitation-demography correlations were weak. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of observational and experimental approaches, and increase our confidence in extrapolating historical relationships to predict population responses to climate change, at least when the historical correlations are strong and based on well-replicated observations.",,,,"Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009",,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1054040]; Utah State University; Utah Agriculture Experiment Station (UAES), Utah State University; Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research (SGS LTER) site [NSF DEB 1027319]; Nature Conservancy Nebraska Chapter's J.E.

This study compares different methods for including interspecific interactions in distribution models for bees, their brood parasites, and the plants they pollinate. Hostparasite interactions among bumble bees (genus Bombus: generalist pollinators and brood parasites) and specialist plantpollinator interactions between Centris bees and Krameria flowers were used as case studies. We used 7 different modelling algorithms available in the BIOMOD R package. For Bombus, the inclusion of interacting species distributions generally increased model predictive accuracy. The improvement was better when the interacting species was included with its raw distribution rather than with its modeled suitability. However, incorporating the distributions of non-interacting species sometimes resulted in similarly increased model accuracy despite their being no significance of any interaction for the distribution. For the Centris-Krameria system the best strategy for modelling biotic interactions was to include the interacting species model-predicted values. However, the results were less consistent than those for Bombus species, and most models including biotic interactions showed no significant improvement over abiotic models.

In Polar regions, the magnitude of such climatic changes is even larger than in temperate and tropical biomes. This amplified response is particularly worrisome given that the so-far moderate warming is already impacting Arctic ecosystems. Predicting species responses to rapid warming in the near future can be informed by investigating past responses, as, like the rest of the planet, the Arctic experienced recurrent cycles of temperature increase and decrease (glacialinterglacial changes) in the past. In this study, we compare the response of two important prey species of the Arctic ecosystem, the collared lemming and the narrow-skulled vole, to Late Quaternary climate change. Using ancient DNA and Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM), we show that the two species, which occupy similar, but not identical ecological niches, show markedly different responses to climatic and environmental changes within broadly similar habitats. We empirically demonstrate, utilizing coalescent model-testing approaches, that collared lemming populations decreased substantially after the Last Glacial Maximum; a result consistent with distributional loss over the same period based on ENM results. Given this strong association, we projected the current niche onto future climate conditions based on IPCC 4.0 scenarios, and forecast accelerating loss of habitat along southern range boundaries with likely associated demographic consequences. Narrow-skulled vole distribution and demography, by contrast, was only moderately impacted by past climatic changes, but predicted future changes may begin to affect their current western range boundaries. Our work, founded on multiple lines of evidence suggests a future of rapidly geographically shifting Arctic small mammal prey communities, some of whom are on the edge of existence, and whose fate may have ramifications for the whole Arctic food web and ecosystem.",,,,"Hofreiter, Michael/A-3996-2017","Hofreiter, Michael/0000-0003-0441-4705; Prost, Stefan/0000-0002-6229-3596; Waltari, Eric/0000-0001-6930-9645",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [047.019.007]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society; Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [11-04-00426]; Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution,"We like to thank A.

As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses.

Drylands, however, are one of the most susceptible biomes to degradation. International programmes widely recognize dryland restoration as key to combating global dryland degradation and ensuring future global sustainability. While the need to restore drylands is widely recognized and large amounts of resources are allocated to these activities, rates of restoration success remain overwhelmingly low. Advances in understanding the ecology of dryland systems have not yielded proportional advances in our ability to restore these systems. To accelerate progress in dryland restoration, we argue for moving the field of restoration ecology beyond conceptual frameworks of ecosystem dynamics and towards quantitative, predictive systems models that capture the probabilistic nature of ecosystem response to management. To do this, we first provide an overview of conceptual dryland restoration frameworks. We then describe how quantitative systems framework can advance and improve conceptual restoration frameworks, resulting in a greater ability to forecast restoration outcomes and evaluate economic efficiency and decision-making. Lastly, using a case study from the western United States, we show how a systems approach can be integrated with and used to advance current conceptual frameworks of dryland restoration. Synthesis and applications. Systems models for restoration do not replace conceptual models but complement and extend these modelling approaches by enhancing our ability to solve restoration problems and forecast outcomes under changing conditions.

Current distributions were modelled using climate, geology, soils, land use, landform and flow variables thought to be important to lotic crayfish. Potential changes in the distribution were forecast by using models trained on current conditions and projecting onto the landscape predicted under climate-change scenarios. 3.The modelled distribution of the four species closely resembled the perceived distribution of each species but also predicted populations in streams and catchments where they had not previously been collected. Soils, elevation and winter precipitation and temperature most strongly related to current distributions and represented 6587% of the predictive power of the models. Model accuracy was high for all models, and model predictions of new populations were verified through additional field sampling. 4.Current models created using two spatial resolutions (1 and 4.5km2) showed that fine-resolution data more accurately represented current distributions. For three of the four species, the 1-km2 resolution models resulted in more conservative predictions. However, the modelled distributional extent of Orconectes leptogonopodus was similar regardless of data resolution. Field validations indicated 1-km2 resolution models were more accurate than 4.5-km2 resolution models. 5.Future projected (4.5-km2 resolution models) model distributions indicated three of the four endemic species would have truncated ranges with low occurrence probabilities under the low-emission scenario, whereas two of four species would be severely restricted in range under moderatehigh emissions. Discrepancies in the two emission scenarios probably relate to the exclusion of behavioural adaptations from species-distribution models. 6.These model predictions illustrate possible impacts of climate change on narrow-range endemic crayfish populations. The predictions do not account for biotic interactions, migration, local habitat conditions or species adaptation. However, we identified the constraining landscape features acting on these populations that provide a framework for addressing habitat needs at a fine scale and developing targeted and systematic monitoring programmes.",,,,"Worthington, Thomas/N-5121-2015; Worthington, Thomas/H-2025-2019","Worthington, Thomas/0000-0002-8138-9075; Worthington, Thomas/0000-0002-8138-9075; Bergey, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7160-6590",Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation,"This research is a contribution of the Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (U.S. Geological Survey, Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, Oklahoma State University, and Wildlife Management Institute cooperating).

In this study, we used an integrative approach to forecast the impact of future ocean conditions on larval purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) from the northeast Pacific Ocean. In laboratory experiments that simulated ocean warming and ocean acidification, we examined larval development, skeletal growth, metabolism and patterns of gene expression using an orthogonal comparison of two temperature (13 degrees C and 18 degrees C) and pCO(2) (400 and 1100 mu atm) conditions. Simultaneous exposure to increased temperature and pCO(2) significantly reduced larval metabolism and triggered a widespread downregulation of histone encoding genes. pCO(2) but not temperature impaired skeletal growth and reduced the expression of a major spicule matrix protein, suggesting that skeletal growth will not be further inhibited by ocean warming. Importantly, shifts in skeletal growth were not associated with developmental delay.

However, empirical support for the altruistic punishment hypothesis depends on results from experiments that are vulnerable to potentially important experimental artefacts. Here, we searched for evidence of altruistic punishment in an experiment that precluded these artefacts. In so doing, we found that victims of unfairness punished transgressors, whereas witnesses of unfairness did not. Furthermore, witnesses' emotional reactions to unfairness were characterized by envy of the unfair individual's selfish gains rather than by moralistic anger towards the unfair behaviour. In a second experiment run independently in two separate samples, we found that previous evidence for altruistic punishment plausibly resulted from affective forecasting error-that is, limitations on humans' abilities to accurately simulate how they would feel in hypothetical situations. Together, these findings suggest that the case for altruistic punishment in humans-a view that has gained increasing attention in the biological and social sciences-has been overstated.",,,,,,Air Force Office of Scientific ResearchUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-12-1-0179]; Arsht Research on Ethics and Community Programme at the University of Miami; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Max Burton-Chellow, Steven Pinker, Stuart A.

In the United States, recent conservation efforts by The Nature Conservancy and partners have identified and mapped the nation's Areas of Biodiversity Significance (ABS), representing the best remaining habitats for the full diversity of native species and ecosystems, and thus the most important and suitable areas for the conservation of native biodiversity. Our goal was to understand the potential consequences of future land use changes on the nation's ABS, and identify regions where ABS are likely to be threatened due to future land use expansion. For this, we used an econometric-based model to forecast land use changes between 2001 and 2051 across the conterminous U. S. under alternative scenarios of future land use change. Our model predicted a total of similar to 100,000 to 160,000 km(2) of natural habitats within ABS replaced by urban, crop and pasture expansion depending on the scenario (5% to 8% habitat loss across the conterminous U.S.), with some regions experiencing up to 30% habitat loss. The majority of the most threatened ABS were located in the Eastern half of the country. Results for our different scenarios were generally fairly consistent, but some regions exhibited notable difference from the baseline under specific policies and changes in commodity prices. Overall, our study suggests that key areas for conserving United States' biodiversity are likely threatened by future land use change, and efforts trying to preserve the ecological and conservation values of ABS will need to address the potential intensification of human land uses.",,,,"Radeloff, Volker/B-6124-2016; Lewis, David J/I-5700-2013","Radeloff, Volker/0000-0001-9004-221X; Lewis, David J/0000-0002-2161-4189",National Science Foundation's Coupled Natural-Human System Program,"This research was supported through a grant from the National Science Foundation's Coupled Natural-Human System Program.

So far, most projections of vegetation distribution rely on correlative species distribution models (SDMs). Yet, process-based or hybrid models based on explicit physiological description may be more robust to extrapolation under future climatic conditions. Differences between model projections may be wide, leading to scepticism among environmental stakeholders. Here, we propose to combine outputs of several distribution models based on physiological responses, to produce both consensual maps of occurrences and maps of associated uncertainty. The consensus map relies on the conditional projections of each SDM. Because the models used are based on processes, their errors are likely to vary consistently with climate as some processes not implemented in a model might be important under a given set of climatic conditions. Uncertainty of the consensus model is thus assessed through multimodel regression of deviance maps with respect to current climatic conditions, and can be extrapolated to forecast climates. We illustrate this approach using three SDMs, on three widely distributed European trees (Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus robur L. and Pinus sylvestris L.), and project their distributions under two scenarios. The conditional consensus outperforms classical methods of model consensus (i.e. to use the mean, the median or a weighted average of individual SDM outputs) in projecting current occurrences. Consistently, with the results of individual SDMs, the conditional consensus projects that the suitable areas for F. sylvatica and Q. robur will expand towards north-eastern Europe, while that of P. sylvestris will contract. Projections of future occurrence are most uncertain towards the margins of the distribution (particularly the trailing edge). Our approach can help modellers identify the limitations of each SDM and stakeholders pinpoint the regions of models agreement and highest certainty.",,,,"Massol, Francois/D-9872-2013","Massol, Francois/0000-0002-4098-955X; Duputie, Anne/0000-0003-2213-7940; Gritti, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7119-1287","Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-05-BDIV-009 QDiv, ANR-2009-PEXT-001105 SCION]; Marie Curie IOF grant within European Commission's FP7 [TRECC-2009-237228]","The authors thank the EMBERS group of Lund University for providing STASH and LPJ models, the ATEAM project for providing climatic datasets, and the GDR CNRS 2968 Observatoire Des Saisons (www.gdr2968.cnrs.fr), the ONF-RENECOFOR Network, the ONF-Seed Service Secherie de la Joux and the French Public Arboreta Network for providing the phenological observations used to parameterize PHENOFIT.

The system collects information in much the same way as other similar systems (e.g. HealthMap, BioCaster). However, the information collected undergoes minimal automated analysis, and analysis is largely left to AquaticHealth.net's users. The result is an automated system of intelligence gathering, combined with a manual system of intelligence analysis. This approach relies on a large number of users, and so AquaticHealth.net relies on an open-intelligence analysis method: any user can publish their own analyses for all to see and analyse further. By combining automated data collection and human analysis, AquaticHealth.net will provide fast and accurate forecasts, accompanied with nuanced explanations. These methods can be applied to other areas of biosecurity and disease surveillance. Location Canberra, Australia; College Park, Maryland, USA; Melbourne, Australia. Methods Automated: AquaticHealth.net performs hourly scans of an array of RSS feeds, blogs, social networks and news sites. It analyses this information and removes redundancies and applies taxonomy and geospatial tags. The information is then pushed to the Daily Scan, where users then analyse it further. Manual: Users assess the information for inaccuracies and its importance. They decide whether an article should be adisease alert, which is emailed to all users. Users can change tags, edit reports, add commentary, apply rankings, change search terms and summarize issues in the Emerging Issues blog (formerly a wiki). Results AquaticHealth.net publishes seven daily reports and 2weekly disease alerts (on average). Ninety per cent of CEFAS's (www.cefas.defra.gov.uk) Emerging Disease Updates cite AquaticHealth.net. The Australian Sub-Committee for Aquatic Animal Health (SCAAH) uses the system to compile quarterly reports. The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) uses AquaticHealth.net to make forecastsfor example, used aquaculture equipment is a high-risk pathway for OsHV. AquaticHealth.net's users forecasted an increase in emerging marine finfish disease outbreaks in Southeast Asia and are actively watching this issue. Main conclusions AquaticHealth.net's open-intelligence approach has proven to be an effective and flexible biosecurity forecasting method.",,,,,,"Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis; Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry","This work was financially supported by the Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis and the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

As a result of about a decade of support by the US Congress and through a few Federal agencies, notably the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, robust Oceans and Human Health (OHH) research and application activities are now relatively widespread, although still small, in a number of agencies and academic institutions. OHH themes and issues have been incorporated into comprehensive federal ocean research plans and are reflected in the new National Ocean Policy enunciated by Executive Order 13547. In just a decade, OHH has matured into a recognized ""metadiscipline,"" with development of a small, but robust and diverse community of science and practice, incorporation into academic educational programs, regular participation in ocean and coastal science and public health societies, and active engagement with public health decision makers. In addition to substantial increases in scientific information, the OHH community has demonstrated ability to respond rapidly and effectively to emergency situations such as those associated with extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods) and human-caused disasters (e.g., the Deep Water Horizon oil spill). Among many other things, next steps include development and implementation of agency health strategies and provision of specific services, such as ecological forecasts to provide routine early warnings for ocean health threats and opportunities for prevention and mitigation of these risks.",,,,"yu, jian/C-1280-2009",,,,,,3,3,0,58,,,,0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.
