Climate change and associated global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, combined with the expansion of generalist -invasive species are two of the main threats. Niche-based models (NBMs) are becoming inevitable tools in invasive species risk assessment and in conservation decision-making. Lithobates catesbeianus is an invasive species globally known for its adverse ecological impacts on native amphibians and biodiversity. To assess species current and future climatic suitable areas at the global and European scales we used an ensemble forecasting approach. We considered six climatic variables, three timeframes (current, 2050, and 2070), and two CO2 emission scenarios. Temperature seasonality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and precipitation in the driest month were the most important variables predicting bullfrog occurrence. Globally currently 3.8% of land area is suitable for bullfrog and an increase of up to 5.2% in 2070 is expected. Increase in suitable areas is expected at higher latitudes, especially in North America and central Europe. Currently, 3.45% of total Natura 2000 area is suitable, and a predicted range gain of up to 355.93% (12.28%) is expected in the highest concentration scenarios predictions. This can indicate that the 64 native amphibian species present in the Natura 2000 network could be at increased risk. The choice of Natura 2000 for a geographic detailed analysis of the possible effects on native amphibians is due to its importance for habitats and wildlife conservation.

Quantifying patterns and developing models of spread are central to understanding drivers of invasion and forecasting future invasions. We investigated the utility of models for characterizing and predicting spread of emerald ash borer (EAB), quantified temporal dynamics of spread and identified correlates of county-level invasion risk. We estimated rates and frequency of EAB spread and length of long-distance jumps throughout the contiguous USA from 1997 to 2018 and compared observed patterns with model predictions. A time-to-event model was then developed at the county level to assess the influence of habitat characteristics and propagule pressure on invasion risk. The final model was used to forecast invasion risk across the contiguous USA. Range expansion by EAB accorded well with model predictions. Following the initial establishment phase, range expansion rates were biphasic, shifting to a faster, linear pattern around 2002 and then declining from 2015 onwards. From 2003 onwards, EAB invaded 6-134 new counties per year, including a mean of 14 discrete jumps per year averaging 93 +/- 7 SE km. Risk of spread was positively associated with proximity to previously invaded areas, human population density and densities of ash and non-ash trees in rural forests but negatively associated with temperature. Synthesis and applications. At the regional level, the invasion by emerald ash borer appears to be entering the saturation phase, indicating that most high-risk counties in the eastern USA have been invaded. Even though spread has recently slowed, counties in close proximity to invaded areas and that have high densities of humans and trees are at the greatest risk of becoming invaded. Taken together, our findings provide insight into historical and future dynamics of range expansion by emerald ash borer, which can be used to guide risk assessments for potential invaders capable of frequent long-distance dispersal.",,,,,"Fei, Songlin/0000-0003-2772-0166",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We demonstrate a novel approach for quantifying uncertainty when predicting the uptake, movement, and establishment of invasive species by combining mechanistic modeling of the spread process with expert opinion of the demographic factors that govern species performance. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using a case study involving the transfer potential of nonindigenous species (NIS) in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin (GLB). A survey using structured expert judgment was completed by 24 North American taxonomic experts, covering 60 species of NIS established in the GLB. Experts estimated species-specific demographic parameters describing population growth and establishment potential, which were incorporated into an existing mechanistic model of human-mediated spread via ballast water with species-specific spread rates (number of ports or lakes invaded/year) as outputs. Expert judgments within each group varied widely, indicating that generalizable rates of spread across taxa are unlikely and highlighting the value of cross-taxon comparisons. Most species were predicted to establish throughout the GLB within 10 yr, assuming status quo management conditions. Sensitivity analysis for expert performance-based weighting demonstrated that most model outputs were insensitive to weighting (<1% difference over baseline) and shows the robustness of the joint model. Overall, the joint expert opinion and predictive modeling method demonstrates a novel means of handling sparse data when forecasting invasion dynamics. Divergent estimates resulted in a range of likely spread rates, but improved upon traditional best-guess approaches. Incorporating joint methods into ecological decision-making frameworks has clear implications for invasive species management but may also inform other ecological scenarios where data are scarce and conservation action is urgent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,APR,2020,11,4,,,,,,,e03011,10.1002/ecs2.3011,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000536583400022,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying forecast skill in marine ecosystems are often poorly understood, and many forecasts, especially for biological variables, rely on empirical statistical relationships developed from historical observations. Here, we review statistical and dynamical marine ecosystem forecasting methods and highlight examples of their application along U.S. coastlines for seasonal-to-interannual (1-24 month) prediction of properties ranging from coastal sea level to marine top predator distributions. We then describe known mechanisms governing marine ecosystem predictability and how they have been used in forecasts to date. These mechanisms include physical atmospheric and oceanic processes, biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing, and intrinsic characteristics of species themselves. In reviewing the state of the knowledge on forecasting techniques and mechanisms underlying marine ecosystem predictability, we aim to facilitate forecast development and uptake by (i) identifying methods and processes that can be exploited for development of skillful regional forecasts, (ii) informing priorities for forecast development and verification, and (iii) improving understanding of conditional forecast skill (i.e., a priori knowledge of whether a forecast is likely to be skillful).

Climate is a primary determinant of plant growth in semi-arid ecosystems, yet it remains difficult to forecast large-scale vegetation shifts (i.e. biome shifts) in response to climate change. We highlight recent advances from four conceptual perspectives that are improving forecasts of semi-arid biome shifts. Moving from small to large scales, first, tree-level models that simulate the carbon costs of drought-induced plant hydraulic failure are improving predictions of delayed-mortality responses to drought. Second, tracer-informed water flow models are improving predictions of species coexistence as a function of climate. Third, new applications of ecohydrological models are beginning to simulate small-scale water movement processes at large scales. Fourth, remotely-sensed measurements of plant traits such as relative canopy moisture are providing early-warning signals that predict forest mortality more than a year in advance. We suggest that a community of researchers using modeling approaches (e.g. machine learning) that can integrate these perspectives will rapidly improve forecasts of semi-arid biome shifts.

Consequently, it becomes particularly important to ascertain their invasion risk and its determinants since such information can help us formulate more effective preventive or management actions and direct these measures to those areas where they are truly needed so as to ease regulatory burdens. Here, we examined the global invasion risk and its determinants of sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus), one freshwater fish which has a high invasive potential, by using species distribution models (SDMs) and a layer overlay method. Specifically, first an ensemble species distribution model and its basal models (developed from seven machine learning algorithms) were explored to forecast the global habitat-suitability and variables importance for this species, and then a global invasion risk map was created by combining habitat-suitability with a proxy for introduction likelihood (entailing propagule pressure and dispersal constraints) of exotic sharpbelly. The results revealed that (1) the ensemble model had the highest predictive power in forecasting sharpbelly's global habitat-suitability; (2) areas with high invasion risk by sharpbelly patchily spread over the world except Antarctica; and (3) the Human Influence Index (HII), rather than any of the bioclimatic variables, was the most important factor influencing sharpbelly' future invasion.

When extreme precipitation possesses strong spatial dependence, the risk of flooding is amplified due to catchment factors such as topography that cause runoff accumulation. Temporal dependence can also increase flood risk as storm water drainage systems operating at capacity can be overwhelmed by heavy precipitation occurring over multiple days. While transformed Gaussian processes are common choices for modeling precipitation, their weak tail dependence may lead to underestimation of flood risk. Extreme value models such as the generalized Pareto processes for threshold exceedances and max-stable models are attractive alternatives, but are difficult to fit when the number of observation sites is large, and are of little use for modeling the bulk of the distribution, which may also be of interest to water management planners. While the atmospheric dynamics governing precipitation are complex and difficult to fully incorporate into a parsimonious statistical model, non-mechanistic analogue methods that approximate those dynamics have proven to be promising approaches to capturing the temporal dependence of precipitation. In this paper, we present a Bayesian analogue method that leverages large, synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns to make precipitation forecasts. Changing spatial dependence across varying intensities is modeled as a mixture of spatial Student-t processes that can accommodate both strong and weak tail dependence. The proposed model demonstrates improved performance at capturing the distribution of extreme precipitation over Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) 5.2 forecasts.

We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60-65% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-asusual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing-and achieving the benefits of-climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities.",,,,"Garcia Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015; Free, Christopher/N-2813-2013","Garcia Molinos, Jorge/0000-0001-7516-1835; Free, Christopher/0000-0002-2557-8920",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,5-Mar,2020,15,3,,,,,,,e0224347,10.1371/journal.pone.0224347,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000535265600009,,,,,

Here, we evaluate the influence of climatic variability and herbivore density on LHP in semiarid grassland using a unique long-term (80 years: 1939-2018) grazing study with three grazing intensities based on forage utilization (light, moderate and heavy). Seasonal variation in precipitation, but not temperature, was the primary influence on LHP. Winter (October-March) and spring (April-June), but not summer (July-September), precipitation during the current year positively influenced LHP across the 3 grazing intensities, whereas prior growing season (prior April-September) precipitation was consistently a negative influence. Although spring precipitation was the most influential seasonal weather variable for LHP, the effect of winter precipitation closely followed under all three grazing intensities, suggesting that non-growing season precipitation is essential for soil water storage to initiate production of sufficient high-quality forage in the subsequent grazing season, resulting in a positive feedback on LHP. A key finding from our analysis was that the effect of summer precipitation is smaller than the combined effects of winter and spring precipitation. As such, much of the variation in LHP can be predicted by seasonal weather parameters that are known early in the growing season. The magnitude of seasonal precipitation effects on LHP was greatest for heavy grazing; consequently LHP with heavy grazing is more reliant on primary production produced in the current year to increase LHP as forage quantity is more limiting than forage quality. Moreover, stability of LHP across years (range: 7.5 to 34.6 kg ha(-1)) was less with heavy grazing, which results in ""boom-bust"" economics that threaten sustainability of operations. Management adaptations to mitigate climatic variability, therefore, will be most necessary and advantageous when land managers employ heavy grazing intensities. Despite the substantial interannual variability in precipitation that characterizes semiarid grasslands, our results show that proactive flexibility by land managers in adjusting grazing management decisions to seasonal precipitation amounts forecasted for the winter and spring seasons would reduce enterprise risk and improve confidence in decision-making, profitability, production efficiency and environmental sustainability from semiarid grasslands.",,,,"Raynor, Edward James/J-8717-2015","Raynor, Edward James/0000-0003-2483-4694; Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

A total of 18 model runs were performed using each of the selected maps in turn with and without calibration with observed pollen data from 2006. The model results were compared with the pollen observation data at 12 measurement sites located in Finland, Denmark, and Russia. We show that calibration of the maps using pollen observations significantly improved the model performance for all three maps. The findings also indicate the large sensitivity of the model results to the source maps and agree well with other studies on birch showing that pollen or hybrid-based source maps provide the best model performance. This study highlights the importance of including pollen data in the production of source maps for pollen dispersion modelling and for exposure studies.",,,,"Sofiev, Mikhail/F-7606-2016; Kaas, Eigil/M-2590-2014","Sofiev, Mikhail/0000-0001-9542-5746; Skjoth, Carsten Ambelas/0000-0001-5992-9568; Kaas, Eigil/0000-0001-6970-2404",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

High uncertainty in biological processes makes the accurate prediction of the outcomes of management interventions very challenging. Adaptive management (AM) offers solutions to reduce uncertainty and improve predictability so that the outcomes of interventions can continuously improve. We quantitatively assess the extent to which AM is used for managing vertebrates, with a focus on invasive non-native species (INNS). Using the Web of Science, we evaluated 3992 articles returned by the search terms 'adaptive management' or 'adaptive harvest management' against seven recommended elements of AM (engagement with stakeholders, defining objectives, forecasting and estimating uncertainty, implementing management, monitoring populations, adjusting management in response to monitoring, and improving forecasting and reducing uncertainty in response to monitoring populations). The use of AM for vertebrates was reported in 56 (1%) of the evaluated studies; including four for managing INNS. Of these, ten studies excluding INNS and no studies of INNS management implemented all seven recommended elements of AM. Those elements infrequently implemented were as follows: the use of analysis or models to forecast and represent uncertainty (44%) and the feedback of monitoring data to improve forecasting and reduce uncertainty (25%). Complete active AM has rarely been implemented and reported for managing INNS, despite the significant advantages it offers. Among studies purporting to have implemented AM, most did not use analyses or models to forecast and represent uncertainty, while most defined objectives, implemented management, and monitored populations. Improvements to ongoing control programmes and much broader adoption of the AM approach are required to increase the efficiency and success of INNS management campaigns and reduce their negative impacts on native species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,APR,2020,50,2,,,SI,,147,156,,10.1111/mam.12182,,Feb-20,,Ecology; Zoology,,,WOS:000511234300001,,,,,

Therefore, the detection and prediction of HABs has become an important issue. Machine learning has been increasingly used to predict HABs at home and abroad. However, few of them can capture the sudden change of Chl-a in advance and handle the long-term dependencies appropriately. In order to address these challenges, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based spatial-temporal attentions model for Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration prediction is proposed, a model which can capture the correlation between various factors and Chl-a adaptively and catch dynamic temporal information from previous time intervals for making predictions. The model can also capture the stage of Chl-a when values soar as red tide breaks out in advance. Due to the instability of the current Chl-a concentration prediction model, the model is also applied to make a prediction about the forecast reliability, to have a basic understanding of the range and fluctuation of model errors and provide a reference to describe the range of marine disasters. The data used in the experiment is retrieved from Fujian Marine Forecasts Station from 2009 to 2011 and is combined into 8-dimension data. Results show that the proposed approach performs better than other Chl-a prediction algorithms (such as Attention LSTM and Seq2seq and back propagation). The result of error prediction also reveals that the error forecast method possesses established advantages for red tides prevention and control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FUTURE INTERNET,Future Internet,FEB,2020,12,2,,,,,,,34,10.3390/fi12020034,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems",,,WOS:000519112500017,,,,,

However, harvesting carnivores creates its own set of conflicts in both society and among conservation professionals, where one consequence is a need to demonstrate that management is sustainable, evidence-based, and guided by science. Furthermore, because large carnivores often also have high degrees of legal protection, harvest quotas have to be carefully justified and constantly adjusted to avoid damaging their conservation status. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to support adaptive management of Eurasian lynx harvesting in Scandinavia. The model uses data from the annual monitoring of lynx abundance and results from long-term field research on lynx biology, which has provided detailed estimates of key demographic parameters. We used the model to predict the probability that the forecasted population size will be below or above the management objectives when subjected to different harvest quotas. The model presented here informs decision makers about the policy risks of alternative harvest levels. Earlier versions of the model have been available for wildlife managers in both Sweden and Norway to guide lynx harvest quotas and the model predictions showed good agreement with observations. We combined monitoring data with data on vital rates and were able to estimate unobserved additional mortality rates, which are most probably due to poaching. In both countries, the past quota setting strategy suggests that there has been a de facto threshold strategy with increasing proportion, which means that there is no harvest below a certain population size, but above this threshold there is an increasing proportion of the population harvested as the population size increases. The annual assessment of the monitoring results, the use of forecasting models, and a threshold harvest approach to quota setting will all reduce the risk of lynx population sizes moving outside the desired goals. The approach we illustrate could be adapted to other populations of mammals worldwide.",,,,,"Broseth, Henrik/0000-0003-3795-891X; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

However, models generate great uncertainty when they are used to predict or forecast ecosystem responses to global change. This uncertainty is partly due to parameterization, which is an essential procedure for model specification via defining parameter values for a model. The classic doctrine of parameterization is that a parameter is constant. However, it is commonly known from modeling practice that a model that is well calibrated for its parameters at one site may not simulate well at another site unless its parameters are tuned again. This common practice implies that parameter values have to vary with sites. Indeed, parameter values that are estimated using a statistically rigorous approach, that is, data assimilation, vary with time, space, and treatments in global change experiments. This paper illustrates that varying parameters is to account for both processes at unresolved scales and changing properties of evolving systems. A model, no matter how complex it is, could not represent all the processes of one system at resolved scales. Interactions of processes at unresolved scales with those at resolved scales should be reflected in model parameters. Meanwhile, it is pervasively observed that properties of ecosystems change over time, space, and environmental conditions. Parameters, which represent properties of a system under study, should change as well. Tuning has been practiced for many decades to change parameter values. Yet this activity, unfortunately, did not contribute to our knowledge on model parameterization at all. Data assimilation makes it possible to rigorously estimate parameter values and, consequently, offers an approach to understand which, how, how much, and why parameters vary. To fully understand those issues, extensive research is required. Nonetheless, it is clear that changes in parameter values lead to different model predictions even if the model structure is the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Methods: The information of observed Iranian new cases from 19th Feb to 30th Mar 2020 was used to predict the number of patients until 29th Apr. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were applied for prediction. The data was prepared from daily reports of Iran Ministry of Health and open datasets provided by the JOHN Hopkins. To compare models, dataset was separated into train and test sets. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was the comparison criteria. Results: Both algorithms forecasted an exponential increase in number of newly infected patients. If the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 7872 and 9558 by 29th Apr, respectively by ANN and ARIMA.

Statistical models are most commonly used for near-term HAB forecasting and resource management, but statistical models are not well suited for longer-term projections as forcing conditions diverge from past observations. Process-based models are more complex, difficult to parameterize, and require extensive calibration, but can mechanistically project HAB response under changing forcing conditions. Nevertheless, process-based models remain prone to failure if key processes emerge with climate change that were not identified in model development based on historical observations. We review recent studies on modeling HABs and their response to climate change, and the various statistical and process-based approaches used to link global climate model projections and potential HAB response. We also make several recommendations for how the field can move forward: 1) use process-based models to explicitly represent key physical and biological factors in HAB development, including evaluating HAB response to climate change in the context of the broader ecosystem; 2) quantify and convey model uncertainty using ensemble approaches and scenario planning; 3) use robust approaches to downscale global climate model results to the coastal regions that are most impacted by HABs; and 4) evaluate HAB models with long-term observations, which are critical for assessing long-term trends associated with climate change and far too limited in extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,HARMFUL ALGAE,Harmful Algae,JAN,2020,91,,,,SI,,,,101729,10.1016/j.hal.2019.101729,,,,Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,WOS:000518705600011,,,,,

Nonlinear dynamics, where a change in the input is not proportional to a change in the output, are often found throughout nature, for example in biochemical kinetics. Because of the complex suite of interacting abiotic and biotic variables present in ecosystems, animal population dynamics are often thought to be driven in a nonlinear, state-dependent fashion. However, so far these have only been identified in model organisms and some natural systems. Here we show that nonlinear population dynamics are ubiquitous in nature. We use nonlinear forecasting to analyse 747 datasets of 228 species to find that insect population trends were highly nonlinear (74%), followed by mammals (58%), bony fish (49%) and birds (35%). This indicates that linear, equilibrium-based model assumptions may fail at predicting population dynamics across a wide range of animal taxa. We show that faster-reproducing animals are more likely to have nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamics, supporting past ecological theory. Lastly, only a third of time series were predictable beyond two years; therefore, the ability to predict animal population trends using these methods may be limited. Our results suggest that the complex dynamics necessary to cause regime shifts and other transitions may be inherent in a wide variety of animals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NAT ECOL EVOL,Nat. Ecol.

Better understanding the coupled water-carbon cycles and their spatiotemporal evolution can inform management and decision-making efforts regarding carbon uptake, food production, water resources, and climate change. The integration of remote sensing and numeric modeling is an attractive approach to address the challenge. Remote sensing can provide extensive data for a number of variables at regional scale and support models, whereas process-based modeling can facilitate investigating the processes that remote sensing cannot well handle (e.g., below-ground and lateral material movement) and backcast/forecast the impacts of environmental change.

In particular, an equal weighted aggregation of individual judgements and the inclusion of a discussion phase and revised estimate helped to improve calibration, statistical accuracy, and the Classical Model score. Further improvements in precision and information were made via performance weighted aggregation.

Here, we aim to contrast the forecast performance and forecast horizon between a single-site approach and a hierarchical multi-site approach where a single model is fitted to data from multiple-sites, and to investigate how they vary with model complexity. We used 5273 population time series on 84 species from the Swedish breeding bird survey program, and found that simple models on average had better forecast performance and forecast horizon than complex models for both the single- and the multi-site approach. However, the cost of complexity was considerably reduced under the multi-site approach, while the proportion of species for which complex models had better forecast performance than simple models was also much larger than under the single-site approach. This suggests that the multi-site approach is useful for inclusion of more detailed processes which may benefit forecasts for some species and which are of importance for managers.

Given that this variability drives changes in ecologically and economically important living marine resources, predictive skill for regional oceanographic conditions is highly desirable. Here, we assess the skill of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts in the CCS using output from Global Climate Forecast Systems in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), and describe mechanisms that underlie SST predictability. A simple persistence forecast provides considerable skill for lead times up to similar to 4 months, while skill above persistence is mostly confined to forecasts of late winter/spring and derives primarily from predictable evolution of ENSO-related variability. Specifically, anomalously weak (strong) equatorward winds are skillfully forecast during El Nino (La Nina) events, and drive negative (positive) upwelling anomalies and consequently warm (cold) temperature anomalies. This mechanism prevails during moderate to strong ENSO events, while years of ENSO-neutral conditions are not associated with significant forecast skill in the wind or significant skill above persistence in SST. We find also a strong latitudinal gradient in predictability within the CCS; SST forecast skill is highest off the Washington/Oregon coast and lowest off southern California, consistent with variable wind forcing being the dominant driver of SST predictability.

LiDAR point clouds were clipped to birch individuals (mapped in 2012-2014 and in 2019), normalised, filtered, and individual tree crowns higher than 5 m were delineated. Then, the crown surface and volume were calculated and aggregated according to wind direction up to 2 km from the pollen trap. Consistent with LIDAR data, hourly airborne pollen measurements (performed using a Hirst-type, 7-day volumetric trap), wind speed and direction data were obtained in April 2012. We delineated 18,740 birch trees, with an average density of 14.9/0.01 km(2), in the study area. The total birch crown surface in the 500-1500 m buffer from the pollen trap was significantly correlated with the pollen concentration aggregated by the wind direction (r = 0.728, p = 0.04). The individual tree crown delineation performed well (r(2) >= 0.89), but overestimations were observed at high birch densities (> 30 trees/plot). We showed that trees outside forests substantially contribute to the total pollen pool. We suggest that including the vertical dimension and the trees outside the forest in pollen source maps have the potential to improve the quality of pollen forecasting models.",,,,,"Bogawski, Pawel/0000-0002-7240-0500; Dziob, Katarzyna/0000-0001-8894-9226",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FORESTS,Forests,DEC,2019,10,12,,,,,,,1154,10.3390/f10121154,,,,Forestry,,,WOS:000507288400027,,,,,

Surface scum (0-1 m) forms as a result of vertical migration by buoyant Microcystis colonies. Accurate forecasting of bloom and scum development is essential for establishing a reliable alert system and requires understanding the role that physicobiological factors play in the vertical distribution of Microcystis in natural ecosystems. We researched the role of limnological processes on the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies in Lake Kinneret (max depth = 38 m) during a winter-spring bloom. We used measurements from a Laser In situ Scattering and Transmissometry profiler and a plankton image analyser, FlowCAM. Various hydrometeorological conditions were captured during 6 outings from 9 February to 21 March 2017. Thermal stratification and turbulence levels influenced the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies and scum formation. During periods of weak turbulence (e.g., vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity [K-z] <1 cm(2) s(-1)), the volume concentration of Microcystis colonies near the surface abruptly increased. High turbulence levels (e.g., windy conditions) dispersed colonies concentrated near the surface. Simulations of the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies under different turbulence levels showed that the thickness of the surface scum layer increased and colony concentration of scum decreased as turbulence level increased. We demonstrated that K-z >3 cm(2) s(-1), driven by the wind and surface heating/cooling, dispersed the surface layer of concentrated Microcystis colonies. Our results revealed an underlying interdependency between environmental factors and Microcystis colony distribution that can be utilized to accurately forecast scum formation.",,,,"Ostrovsky, Ilia/M-4831-2017","Ostrovsky, Ilia/0000-0002-0247-7844",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INLAND WATERS,Inland Waters,2-Jan,2020,10,1,,,,,51,70,,10.1080/20442041.2019.1637681,,Nov-19,,Limnology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,WOS:000500381800001,,,,,

Ongoing ecological forecasting efforts focus mostly on long-term datasets of continuous variables, such as CO2 fluxes, or more abrupt variables, such as phenological events or algal blooms. Generally lacking from these forecasting efforts is the integration of short-term, opportunistic data concurrent with developing climate extremes such as drought. We posit that incorporating targeted experiments and regional surveys, implemented rapidly during developing extreme events, into current forecasting efforts will ultimately enhance our ability to forecast ecological responses to climate extremes, which are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity. We highlight a project, ""chasing tree die-off,"" in which we coupled an experiment with regional-scale observational field surveys during a developing severe drought to test and improve forecasts of tree die-off. General insights to consider in incorporating this approach include: (1) tracking developing climate extremes in near-real time to efficiently ramp up measurements rapidly and, if feasible, initiate an experiment quickly-including funding and site selection challenges; (2) accepting uncertainty in projected extreme climatic events and adjusting sampling design over-time as needed, especially given the spatially heterogeneous nature of many ecological disturbances; and (3) producing timely and iterative output.

However, despite the availability of phenological data with large spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents, and numerous phenology models, there have been no automated species-level forecasts of plant phenology. This is due in part to the challenges of building a system that integrates large volumes of climate observations and forecasts, uses that data to fit models and make predictions for large numbers of species, and consistently disseminates the results of these forecasts in interpretable ways. Here, we describe a new near-term phenology-forecasting system that makes predictions for the timing of budburst, flowers, ripe fruit, and fall colors for 78 species across the United States up to 6 months in advance and is updated every four days.

Here, we developed SDMs to explore potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability of ichthyoplankton. Location Yangtze Estuary, China. Methods Using long-term ichthyoplankton survey data and a large set of marine predictor variables, we developed ensemble SDMs for five abundant ichthyoplankton species in the Yangtze Estuary (Coilia mystus, Hypoatherina valenciennei, Larimichthys polyactis, Salanx ariakensis and Chelidonichthys spinosus).

Results The ensemble SDMs had good predictive performance and were successful in estimating the known distributions of the five species. Model projections highlighted two contrasting patterns of response to future climates: while C. mystus will likely expand its range, the ranges of the other four species will likely contract and shift northward. Main conclusions According to our SDM projections, the five ichthyoplankton species that we tested in the Yangtze Estuary are likely to respond differently to future climate changes. These projected different responses seemingly reflect the differential functional attributes and life-history strategies of these species.

Here, we assess several existing population modelling approaches and find limitations to both 'correlative' and 'mechanistic' models. We advocate the need for a standardized mechanistic approach for linking individual mechanisms (physiology, behaviour, and evolution) to population dynamics in spatially explicit landscapes. Such an approach is potentially more flexible and informative than current population models. Key to realizing this goal, however, is overcoming current data limitations, the development and testing of eco-evolutionary theory to represent interactions between individual mechanisms, and standardized multi-dimensional environmental change scenarios which incorporate multiple stressors.

As such, prediction models that utilize temperature for estimating future bark beetle locations and consequential tree mortality are critical for informing forest management decision-making in an attempt to mitigate and adapt to pending and current outbreaks. This is especially true for physiological models that account for the effects of overwinter temperatures on bark beetle survival, as seasonal temperatures, specifically during winter months, exert the greatest impact on bark beetle mortality during various stages of life cycle development. Yet, how temperature observations are used to predict bark beetle survival can significantly under- or over-estimate the role that temperature variability plays in annual tree mortality, especially under current climate change trajectories. This study evaluates how representations of winter temperature influence bark beetle survival estimates. Using the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) across the western USA as a case study, single-year to decade-long winter temperature averages were used as inputs into a physiological beetle survival prediction model, the results of which were compared against beetle-induced tree mortality observations using temporal autoregressive models. Results show that using longer-term survival averages of seven to ten years significantly increases the likelihood that temperature alone can predict general levels of beetle survival and hence beetle-induced mortality. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the role of long-term temperature observations when forecasting bark beetle outbreaks, and that year-to-year temperature variability may be constrained in predicting beetle survival during outbreak periods.",,,,,"Bone, Christopher/0000-0003-4159-5197",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FORESTS,Forests,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,866,10.3390/f10100866,,,,Forestry,,,WOS:000498395600043,,,,,

Novel environments are challenging because they can cause maladaptation, increasing the risk of extinction by negative population growth. Animals can avoid extinction by improving the phenotype-environment match through behavioural responses, notably matching habitat choice and learning. However, the demographic consequences of these responses remain insufficiently understood in part because they have not been analysed within a life-history context. By means of an individual-based model, we show here that matching habitat choice and learning interact with life history to influence persistence in novel environments. In maladaptive contexts, the likelihood of persisting is higher for life-history strategies that increase the value of adults over the value of offspring, even at the cost of decreasing reproduction. Such a strategy facilitates persistence in novel environments by reducing the costs of a reproductive failure while increasing the benefits of behavioural responses. Our results reinforce the view that a more predictive theory for extinction risk under rapid environmental changes requires considering behavioural responses and life history as part of a common adaptive strategy to cope with environmental changes.

Given its natural presence in brackish waters, there is a need to develop operational forecast models that can sufficiently predict the bacterium's spatial and temporal variation. This work attempted to develop V. parahaemolyticus prediction models using frequently measured time-indexed and -lagged water quality measures. Models were built using a large data set (n = 1,043) of surface water samples from 2007 to 2010 previously analyzed for V. parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay. Water quality variables were classified as time indexed, 1-month lag, and 2-month lag. Tobit regression models were used to account for V. parahaemolyticus measures below the limit of quantification and to simultaneously estimate the presence and abundance of the bacterium. Models were evaluated using cross-validation and metrics that quantify prediction bias and uncertainty. Presence classification models containing only one type of water quality parameter (e.g., temperature) performed poorly, while models with additional water quality parameters (i.e., salinity, clarity, and dissolved oxygen) performed well. Lagged variable models performed similarly to time-indexed models, and lagged variables occasionally contained a predictive power that was independent of or superior to that of time-indexed variables. Abundance estimation models were less effective, primarily due to a restricted number of samples with abundances above the limit of quantification. These findings indicate that an operational in situ prediction model is attainable but will require a variety of water quality measurements and that lagged measurements will be particularly useful for forecasting. Future work will expand variable selection for prediction models and extend the spatial-temporal extent of predictions by using geostatistical interpolation techniques. IMPORTANCE Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the leading causes of seafood-borne illness in the United States and across the globe. Exposure often occurs from the consumption of raw shellfish. Despite public health concerns, there have been only sporadic efforts to develop environmental prediction and forecast models for the bacterium preharvest. This analysis used commonly sampled water quality measurements of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and clarity to develop models for V. parahaemolyticus in surface water. Predictors also included measurements taken months before water was tested for the bacterium. Results revealed that the use of multiple water quality measurements is necessary for satisfactory prediction performance, challenging current efforts to manage the risk of infection based upon water temperature alone. The results also highlight the potential advantage of including historical water quality measurements. This analysis shows promise and lays the groundwork for future operational prediction and forecast models.",,,,"Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020","Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Davis, Benjamin/0000-0003-4909-2746",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

Understanding, describing (modeling), estimating, and predicting (forecasting) this variation is essential to appropriate stock assessment and fisheries management. Most modern stock assessments estimate annual variation in recruitment, particularly those that include age or size composition data. Changes over time are often partitioned into those related to the spawning biomass due to density dependence (the stock-recruitment relationship) and those related to other factors such as environmental conditions. Several methods have been used to model recruitment inside stock assessment models, and they differ by how recruitment is represented and how statistical inference is conducted. Virtual population analyses make few statistical assumptions about recruitment and instead calculate recruitment as the sum of the mortality-adjusted catches of a cohort while surplus production models generally imply a stock recruitment relationship in their production function. Integrated statistical stock assessment models have modelled recruitment using a stock-recruitment relationship, autocorrelation, a function of covariates, regime shifts, or a combination of these. Statistical inference has typically been conducted using state-space (hierarchical) models, whether using Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods, or inferences are approximated using penalized likelihood approaches, which may not be statistically reliable. All these methods have specific issues that need to be addressed and there are tradeoffs in their use. Future temporal variation also needs to be considered when providing management advice. We review the theory and practice of modelling temporal variation in recruitment in fisheries stock assessment, provide advice on good practices, and recommend important research.",,,,"Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014; Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019","Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,SEP,2019,217,,,,SI,,71,86,,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.12.014,,,,Fisheries,,,WOS:000473841400008,,,,,

We overview important management implications arising from choices and assumptions made when modelling recruitment and propose pragmatic solutions. An age-structured population model is used to highlight some additional considerations including (1) incorrect assumptions about the source of recruits and (2) ways to account for environmental correlates in stock assessment models, either directly or indirectly. Existing stationary approaches ignore the sometimes considerable influence of the environment on population processes such as recruitment, growth and mortality, all of which are expected to shift under changing climate. We show that where environmental relationships are explicitly included in models, they need to be rigorously assessed and model parameterization carefully evaluated. Variability in annual recruitment estimates (specified by the standard deviation sigma(R)) must be adjusted to control the partitioning of total variation into environmental and unexplained variation, as reference point estimates are particularly sensitive to the choice of sigma(R). Finally, we evaluate two recommended solutions to these issues: Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) that are robust to recruitment uncertainty and variability, and empirical HCRs that use pre-season survey inputs as a way to more directly provide forecasts without needing to quantify the complex underlying details of the environmental-recruitment relationships.",,,,"; Plaganyi, Eva/C-5130-2011","Gorton, Rebecca/0000-0002-5290-3506; Plaganyi, Eva/0000-0002-4740-4200; Deng, Roy/0000-0001-9368-1332",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,SEP,2019,217,,,,SI,,169,184,,10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.007,,,,Fisheries,,,WOS:000473841400016,,,,,

Previous research suggests that including environmental drivers of fish recruitment in forecasting is of limited value, concluding that forecasting improvements are minimal while potential spurious relationships were sufficient to advise against inclusion. This review evaluates progress in implementing environmental factors in stock-recruitment projections and Management Strategy Evaluations (MSEs), from the year 2000 through 2017, by reviewing studies that incorporate environmental processes into recruitment forecasting, full-cycle MSEs, or simulations investigating harvest control rules. The only successes identified were for species with a short pre-recruit survival window (e.g., opportunistic life-history strategy), where the abbreviated life-span made it easier to identify one or a limited set of key drivers that directly impact dynamics. Autoregressive methods appeared to perform as well, if not better, for species with a longer pre-recruit survival window (e.g., seasonal, inter-annual) during which the environment could potentially exert influence. This review suggests that the inclusion of environmental drivers into assessments and forecasting is most likely to be successful for species with short pre-recruit survival windows (e.g., squid, sardine) and for those that have bottlenecks in their life history during which the environment can exert a well-defined pressure (e.g., anadromous fishes, those reliant on nursery areas). The effects of environment may be more complicated and variable for species with a longer pre-recruit survival window, reducing the ability to quantify environment-recruitment relationships. Species with more complex early life histories and longer pre-recruit survival windows would benefit from future research that focuses on relevant species-specific spatio-temporal scales to improve mechanistic understanding of abiotic-biotic interactions.",,,,"Haltuch, Melissa/W-7136-2019; Brooks, ELIZABETH/AAD-2502-2020; Payne, Mark/C-6844-2008","Haltuch, Melissa/0000-0003-2821-1267; Payne, Mark/0000-0001-5795-2481; Brooks, Elizabeth N/0000-0002-9142-4372",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,SEP,2019,217,,,,SI,,198,216,,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.12.016,,,,Fisheries,,,WOS:000473841400018,,,,,

However, they rarely include the diversity of individual responses to environmental changes, thus hampering our understanding of demographic mechanisms. We develop an integrated integral projection model (IPM2) that is a combination of an integrated population model (IPMpop) and an integral projection model (IPMind). IPM2 includes interactions between environmental and individual effects on demographic rates and can forecast both population size and individual trait distributions. First, we study the performance of this model using eight simulated scenarios with variable reproductive selective pressures on an individual trait. When the individual trait interacts with the environmental variable and the selective pressure on the individual trait is nonlinear, only IPM2 produces adequate predictions, because IPMind does not link predictions between the population level and observed data and because IPMpop does not include the individual trait. Second, we apply IPM2 to a population of barn swallows. The model accurately predicts trends of the barn swallow population while also providing mechanistic insights. High precipitation negatively influenced population dynamics through delaying laying dates, which lowered reproductive and survival rates. To predict the future of populations, we need to understand their individual drivers and thus include individual responses to their environment while following the entire population. As a consequence, IPM2 will improve our ability to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses and improve the accuracy of population forecasting to aid management programs.",,,,,"Gruebler, Martin U./0000-0003-4468-8292",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

This disease accounts for substantial economic losses in China every year. Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is one of the major vectors by which citrus HLB is spread under natural conditions in China. Research is needed to identify the geographic distribution of D. citri and its major areas of occurrence and to formulate measures for early warning, monitoring, and control of this pest and citrus HLB. Methods: In this study, the ecological niche modelling software MaxEnt (maximum entropy model) was combined with ArcGIS (a geographic information system) to predict the potential geographic distribution of D. citri in China. Key environmental factors and the appropriate ranges of their values were also investigated. Results: Our results show that the training data provided a good forecast (AUC(mean) = 0.988). The highly suitable areas for D. citri in China are mainly concentrated to the south of the Yangtze River, and the total area is 139.83 x 10(4) km(2). The area of the moderately suitable areas is 27.71 x 10(4) km(2), with a narrower distribution than that of the highly suitable area. The important environmental factors affecting the distribution of D. citri were min temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, mean temperature of warmest quarter, precipitation of warmest quarter, max temperature of warmest month, and temperature seasonality. These results provide a valuable theoretical basis for risk assessments and control of D. citri. Discussion: The predicted results showed that there were highly suitable areas for D. citri in Chongqing, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Therefore, the possibility exists for the further spread of D. citri in China in the future. Extreme temperature variables, especially the min temperature of the coldest month, play an important role in the distribution of D. citri and are most closely related to the distribution of D. citri.",,,,"WANG, Rulin/AAE-6849-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,15-Jul,2019,7,,,,,,,,e7323,10.7717/peerj.7323,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000475470400015,,,,,

Although surveillance programs provide useful current and historical information on the scale of the problem, the future emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is uncertain, and quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for guiding decisions about investment in antibiotics and resistance control strategies. Mathematical and statistical models capable of projecting future rates are challenged by the paucity of data and the complexity of the emergence and spread of resistance, but experts have relevant knowledge. We use the Classical Model of structured expert judgment to elicit projections with uncertainty bounds of resistance rates through 2026 for nine pathogen-antibiotic pairs in four European countries and empirically validate the assessments against data on a set of calibration questions. The performance-weighted combination of experts in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom projected that resistance for five pairs on the World Health Organization's priority pathogens list (E. coli and K. pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems and MRSA) would remain below 50% in 2026. In Italy, although upper bounds of 90% credible ranges exceed 50% resistance for some pairs, the medians suggest Italy will sustain or improve its current rates. We compare these expert projections to statistical forecasts based on historical data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). Results from the statistical models differ from each other and from the judgmental forecasts in many cases.

Science-based management is broadly recognized as leading to more effective decisions yet application of models to actively guide disease surveillance and mitigate risks remains limited. Disease-dynamic models are an efficient method of providing information for management decisions because of their ability to integrate and evaluate multiple, complex processes simultaneously while accounting for uncertainty common in animal diseases. Here we review disease introduction pathways and transmission processes crucial for informing disease management and models at the interface of domestic animals and wildlife. We describe how disease transmission models can improve disease management and present a conceptual framework for integrating disease models into the decision process using adaptive management principles. We apply our framework to a case study of African swine fever virus in wild and domestic swine to demonstrate how disease-dynamic models can improve mitigation of introduction risk. We also identify opportunities to improve the application of disease models to support decision-making to manage disease at the interface of domestic and wild animals. First, scientists must focus on objective-driven models providing practical predictions that are useful to those managing disease. In order for practical model predictions to be incorporated into disease management a recognition that modeling is a means to improve management and outcomes is important. This will be most successful when done in a cross-disciplinary environment that includes scientists and decision-makers representing wildlife and domestic animal health. Lastly, including economic principles of value-of-information and cost-benefit analysis in disease-dynamic models can facilitate more efficient management decisions and improve communication of model forecasts. Integration of disease-dynamic models into management and decision-making processes is expected to improve surveillance systems, risk mitigations, outbreak preparedness, and outbreak response activities.",,,,,"Miller, Ryan/0000-0003-3892-0251",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J ANIM SCI,J.

In this study, we use a machine learning model to assess the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay at a monthly time scale. Compared to previous models for dissolved oxygen and hypoxia, our model has the advantages of resolving spatial variability and fitting more flexible relationships between dissolved oxygen and the predictor variables. Using a concise set of predictors with established relationships with dissolved oxygen, we find that dissolved oxygen in a given month can be skillfully predicted with knowledge of stratification and mean temperature during the same month. Furthermore, the predictions generated by the model are consistent with expectations from prior knowledge and basic physics. The model reveals that accurate knowledge or skillful forecasts of the vertical density gradient is the key to successful prediction of dissolved oxygen, and prediction skill disappears if stratification is only known at the beginning of the forecast. The lost skill cannot be recovered by replacing stratification as a predictor with variables that have a lagged correlation with stratification (such as river discharge); however, skill is obtainable in many cases if stratification can be forecast with an error of less than about 1 kg m(-3). Thus, future research on hypoxia forecasting should focus on understanding and forecasting variations in stratification over subseasonal time scales (between about two weeks and two months).",,,,,"Ross, Andrew/0000-0003-1770-893X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ESTUAR COAST SHELF S,Estuar.

Field campaigns were organised in 2015, 2016 and 2017, during which ground measurements were collected. At field level and under rainfed conditions, above ground total dry biomass and field management information (crop density, planting dates, biomass measurements etc.) was collected. Green fractional vegetation cover (fCover) data were retrieved from high spatial and temporal satellite images (DMC-2/ DEIMOS-1 and Sentinel-2). Maximum canopy cover and emergence date were derived from the time series and assimilated into AquaCrop. The model was calibrated with the 2015-2016 dataset and validated with 2017 data. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the biomass assessment was 0.7 ton/ha and the R-2 reached 0.85.

To simultaneously run and evaluate the ensemble of field-level simulations, a semi-automated R-environment was developed.

They also contribute to global economies by directly and indirectly supporting commercial and recreational fisheries. Managing forage fish is problematic due to their high spatial-temporal variation in biomass and strong responses to environmental variability. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain variation in capelin Mallotus villosus biomass, a keystone forage fish in the Northwest Atlantic, including factors influencing cohort strength such as larval abundance and larval food (i.e. Pseudocalanus spp.) availability. Alternately, pre-spawning mortality of capelin may be regulated by the timing of the retreat of sea ice (t(i)(ce)) via its effects on the spring bloom and the availability of food (e.g. Calanus spp.) for adult capelin, or by the condition of adult capelin the previous fall. Here, we used a Bayesian approach in a multimodel inference framework to assess support for a series of hypotheses explaining the population dynamics of capelin. The most parsimonious model included larval abundance, t(i)(ce), and capelin condition in the fall, and explained 68% of the variance in capelin biomass. These results are consistent with much of the literature that suggests capelin in the Northwest Atlantic are driven by bottom-up forces. This model allows us to produce forecasts of capelin biomass 1-2 management cycles in advance, which will be a valuable contribution to the management of this forage fish species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems' intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE-FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data.

We investigated drivers of outbreaks by larch casebearer Coleophora laricella, an invasive defoliator, and eastern larch beetle Dendroctonus simplex, a native, tree-killing bark beetle, on tamarack Larix laricina from 2000 to in Minnesota, USA. We evaluated the utility of temporal, spatial and climatic variables in predicting the presence/absence of outbreaks of each insect in cells of rasterized aerial survey data. The role of defoliation by larch casebearer in outbreaks of eastern larch beetle was also investigated. For both species, the most important predictors of outbreak occurrence were proximity of conspecific outbreaks in space and time. For larch casebearer, outbreak occurrence was positively associated with spring precipitation and warmer growing seasons. Outbreak occurrence of eastern larch beetle was positively associated with warmer and dryer years and was more likely in cells with prior defoliation by larch casebearer.

Temperature and day length are known environmental drivers of the reproductive timing of many species. Hence, reproductive phenology is sensitive to warming and is important to be considered for reliable predictions of species distributions. This is particularly relevant for rapidly spreading non-indigenous species (NIS). In this study, we forecast the future ranges of a NIS, the seaweed Sargassum muticum, including its reproductive phenology. Location Coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere (Pacific and Atlantic oceans). Methods We used ecological niche modelling to predict the distribution of S. muticum under two scenarios forecasting limited (RCP 2.6) and severe (RCP 8.5) future climate changes. We then refined our predictions with a hybrid model using sea surface temperature constraints on reproductive phenology. Results Under the most severe climate change scenario, we predicted northward expansions which may have significant ecological consequences for subarctic coastal ecosystems. However, in lower latitudes, habitats currently occupied by S. muticum will no longer be suitable, creating opportunities for substantial community changes. The temperature constraints imposed by the reproductive window were shown to restrict the modelled future species expansion strongly. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the total range area was expected to increase by 61.75% by 2100, but only by 1.63% when the reproductive temperature window was considered.

It is assumed that the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity of algal blooms is determined by divergence/convergence processes in the fluid medium. To address this issue, three episodes of the dominant spatial patterns of hourly simulated divergence fields of current in Lake Taihu in July of 2012 were analyzed using a hydrodynamic numerical model combined with the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) method. The results showed that, on days that blooms occurred, the first two EOF modes explained 89.4% of the variability and the dominant spatial patterns of stronger convergence zones were in agreement with the regions of bloom occurrence and accumulation. When no blooms occurred, the first EOF mode explained 72.5% of the variability and divergence zones were dominant in the lake. Both the simulated hourly average divergence field and the first EOF mode in the time interval in which blooms occurred further confirmed that blooms accumulate in the current convergence zones.

The timing of algal blooms correlates highly to a summer low-flow period when residence time is long and nutrients are available. Because of complex interactions between physical transport and algal dynamics, it is challenging to predict interannual variations of bloom correctly using a complex eutrophication model without having a high-resolution model grid to resolve complex geometry and an accurate estimate of nutrient loading to drive the model. In this study, an approach using long-term observational data (from 1990 to 2013) and the Support vector machine (LS-SVM) for simulating algal blooms was applied. The Empirical Orthogonal Function was used to reduce the data dimension that enables the algal bloom dynamics for the entire TT to be modeled by one model. The model results indicate that the data-driven model is capable of simulating interannual algal blooms with good predictive skills and is capable of forecasting algal blooms responding to the change of nutrient loadings and environmental conditions. This study provides a link between a conceptual model and a dynamic model, and demonstrates that the data-driven model is a good approach for simulating algal blooms in this complex environment of the James River.

The shape of the response curves of the species for the environmental variables in the nine modelling techniques, together with three biological and ecological traits were used to assess the potential vulnerability of each species to climate change. The joint use of SDMs and trait approach appeared complementary and even though discrepancies were highlighted between SDMs and trait analyses, groups of potential winners and losers were raised out.

Using a modified daily Thornthwaite (TH) equation and temperature forecasts, a method was proposed for ET0 forecasting. Daily meteorological data were obtained from the selected representative stations located in different climate regions in China. Data were collected from 2000 to 2012 to calibrate and validate the modified TH equation against the FAO56 Penman-Monteith (FAO56-PM) equation. Temperatures forecasts for a 7-day forecast period in 2012-2017 were input to the calibrated TH equation to forecast ET0. The results showed that the ET0 forecasting performance with the modified TH equation and temperature forecast was further improved at all stations after month-wise calibration. The average accuracy of forecasted ET0 ranged from 87.3 to 91.2%, the average values of root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.86 to 1.01 mm day ? (1); moreover, the average of regression coefficient (b), determined coefficient (R-2) and modelling efficiency (EF) are greater than 0.82, 0.87 and 0.81. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses show that the percentage change in ET0 forecast was more sensitive to predictions of temperature during the spring-summer period than autumn-winter.

WOODLANDS; GROWTH; DECOMPOSITION,"Mediterranean ecosystems are hotspots for climate change, as the highest impacts are forecasted for the Mediterranean region, mainly by more frequent and intense severe droughts. Plant phenology is a good indicator of species' responses to climate change. In this study, we compared the spring phenology of cork oak trees (Quercus suber), an evergreen species, over 2 contrasting years, a mild year (2004) and a dry year (2005), which was the most severe drought since records exist. We evaluated the timing of occurrence, duration, and intensity of bud development, budburst, shoot elongation, trunk growth, and leaf senescence (phenophases) and assessed the nitrogen resorption efficiency from senescent to green leaves. The temperature was the main driver of budburst. Nevertheless, water had the main role of constraining all the other phenophases by strongly reducing the growing season length (-48 %) and consequently the tree growth. Basal area increment was the most affected growth variable (-36 %), although it occurred at a similar rate in the 2 years. Shoot elongation was also reduced (-21 %), yet elongation occurred at a higher rate in the dry year compared to the mild year. Leaf senescence during the bulk period was higher in the dry year, in which leaves were shed at the same rate over a longer period. Nitrogen concentrations in green and senescent leaves were affected by drought and nitrogen resorption efficiency increased remarkably (+22 %). Our results highlight the importance of studying different phenological metrics to improve our understanding of the ecosystem's responses to climate change. The faster dynamics observed in shoot elongation, while all other phenophases developed at the same rate, indicate that leaf area development is privileged in cork oak. Water availability was the main driver of spring growth in this Mediterranean ecosystem; however, growth may be affected by complex interplays between precipitation and temperature, such as higher temperatures during dry winters or heatwaves during spring, that are likely to result in water stress. Longer studies are needed to disentangle those interplays. Finally, a higher nitrogen resorption efficiency in response to drought appears to be an adaptive trait that mitigates the limitation in nitrogen uptake by the roots during drought and contributes to improving tree fitness in the short term but will probably exert a negative feedback on the nitrogen cycle in the long term, which might affect the ecosystem functioning under the forecasted droughts.",,,,"Caldeira, Maria/D-4107-2013; Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel/D-4570-2013","Caldeira, Maria/0000-0002-3586-8526; Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel/0000-0003-4566-5420",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,27-Mar,2019,16,6,,,,,1265,1279,,10.5194/bg-16-1265-2019,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000462595600002,,,,,

To realize ecological forecasting, we have developed an Ecological Platform for Assimilating Data (EcoPAD, v1.0) into models. EcoPAD (v1.0) is a web-based software system that automates data transfer and processing from sensor networks to ecological forecasting through data management, model simulation, data assimilation, forecasting, and visualization. It facilitates interactive data-model integration from which the model is recursively improved through updated data while data are systematically refined under the guidance of model. EcoPAD (v1.0) relies on data from observations, process-oriented models, DA techniques, and the web-based workflow. We applied EcoPAD (v1.0) to the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental change (SPRUCE) experiment in northern Minnesota. The EcoPAD- SPRUCE realizes fully automated data transfer, feeds meteorological data to drive model simulations, assimilates both manually measured and automated sensor data into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model, and recursively forecasts the responses of various biophysical and biogeochemical processes to five temperature and two CO2 treatments in near-real time (weekly). Forecasting with EcoPAD-SPRUCE has revealed that mismatches in forecasting carbon pool dynamics are more related to model (e.g., model structure, parameter, and initial value) than forcing variables, opposite to forecasting flux variables. EcoPAD-SPRUCE quantified acclimations of methane production in response to warming treatments through shifted posterior distributions of the CH4 : CO2 ratio and the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of methane production towards lower values. Different case studies indicated that realistic forecasting of carbon dynamics relies on appropriate model structure, correct parameterization, and accurate external forcing. Moreover, EcoPADSPRUCE stimulated active feedbacks between experimenters and modelers to identify model components to be improved and additional measurements to be taken. It has become an interactive model-experiment (ModEx) system and opens a novel avenue for interactive dialogue between modelers and experimenters. Altogether, EcoPAD (v1.0) acts to integrate multiple sources of information and knowledge to best inform ecological forecasting.",,,,"Xia, Jianyang/S-9499-2019; Hanson, Paul J.

However, few studies focus specifically on fundamental issues encountered in developing a high-performance statistical crop model for yield prediction. Such issues include: how to select predictors and fitting functions, how to effectively address the spatiotemporal scale issue, weather it is beneficial to include satellite data as explanatory variables, and how to reconcile different model evaluation procedures. In this study, we present our statistical modeling practices for predicting rainfed corn yield in the Midwest U.S. and address the aforementioned issues through comprehensive diagnostic analysis. Our results show that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation at a monthly scale, in spline form with customized knots, define the ""Best Climate-only"" model among alternative climate variables (e.g., air temperature) and fitting functions (e.g., linear or polynomial), with an out-of-sample (leave-one-year out) median R-2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 1.04 t/ha (16.6 bu/acre) from 2003 to 2016. Satellite variables, such as MODIS land surface temperature and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when used as predictors alone, reduce the model's RMSE to 0.93 t/ha (14.8 bu/acre). Adding satellite variables (i.e., EVI in polynomial form) to the ""Best Climate-only"" model gives the ""Best Climate + EVI"" model, which has the highest prediction performance of this study, with a median R-2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.90 t/ha (14.3 bu/acre). Such a model trained using all data (so-called ""global model"") in most cases leads to better predictions than the state-specific trained models. However, the global model's prediction performance exhibits considerable regional and interannual variations. The regional-varying performance is related to states' spatiotemporal variability in yield, where states with larger spatial yield variability show higher R-2, and states with smaller temporal yield variability show lower RMSE. Interannual variations in prediction performance are linked to yield variability and degree of wetness, with higher R-2 in years with larger yield variability but increasingly larger RMSE toward wetter years and extreme dry years. These identified spatial and temporal variations of model's performance, together with inconsistent evaluation practices undermine the comparability between statistical modeling studies. Alleviating such comparability issues requires more transparency and open data practices. The statistical model presented in this study provides a benchmark for further development and can be applied to future research related to yield prediction or assessment of climate change impact.",,,,"Li, Yan/C-3891-2016; Zhao, Lei/S-1855-2019; Guan, Kaiyu/N-5772-2015","Li, Yan/0000-0002-6336-0981; Zhao, Lei/0000-0002-6481-3786; Guan, Kaiyu/0000-0002-3499-6382",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools. These can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, and anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies. Analysis and prediction tools are defined here as ocean circulation models that are coupled to biogeochemical or ecological models. The range of potential applications for these systems is broad, ranging from reanalyses for the assessment of past and current states, and short-term and seasonal forecasts, to scenario simulations including climate change projections. The objectives of this article are to illustrate current capabilities with regard to the three types of applications, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities. Representative examples of global and regional systems are described with particular emphasis on those in operational or pre-operational use. With regard to the benefits and challenges, similar considerations apply to biogeochemical and ecological prediction systems as do to physical systems. However, at present there are at least two major differences: (1) biogeochemical observation streams are much sparser than physical streams presenting a significant hinderance, and (2) biogeochemical and ecological models are largely unconstrained because of insufficient observations. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems will allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, with multiple societal benefits.",,,,"Fennel, Katja/A-7470-2009; Ciavatta, Stefano/AAL-1381-2020; Brown, Christopher W./B-8213-2008","Fennel, Katja/0000-0003-3170-2331; Ciavatta, Stefano/0000-0001-7165-2805; Brown, Christopher W./0000-0002-9905-6391; Friedrichs, Marjorie/0000-0003-2828-7595; COSSARINI, Gianpiero/0000-0001-7803-8568; Gehlen, Marion/0000-0002-9688-0692",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

However, a linear correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causality between them. Here, we apply a recently developed method, convergent cross mapping (CCM), to examine the causal connections between NAM and wintertime surface air temperature (SAT) over Northeast Asia. Our analysis indicates that both NAM and SAT exhibit nonlinear dynamical structure and that NAM information is encoded in the SAT data but not the other way around. This indicates a causality between them in the direction NAMSAT.

This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate ecosystems where the warmest temperatures and greatest moisture availability are seasonally asynchronous. We examined plant phenological responses at both the population and community levels to four climate treatments (control, warming, drought, and warming plus additional precipitation) embedded within three prairies across a 520 km latitudinal Mediterranean climate gradient within the Pacific Northwest, USA. At the population level, we monitored flowering and abundances in spring 2017 of eight range-restricted focal species planted both within and north of their current ranges. At the community level, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured from fall 2016 to summer 2018 to estimate peak live biomass, senescence, seasonal patterns, and growing season length. We found that warming exerted a stronger control than our moisture manipulations on phenology at both the population and community levels. Warming advanced flowering regardless of whether a species was within or beyond its current range. Importantly, many of our focal species had low abundances, particularly in the south, suggesting that establishment, in addition to phenological shifts, may be a strong constraint on their future viability. At the community level, warming advanced the date of peak biomass regardless of site or year. The date of senescence advanced regardless of year for the southern and central sites but only in 2018 for the northern site. Growing season length contracted due to warming at the southern and central sites (similar to 3 weeks) but was unaffected at the northern site. Our results emphasize that future temperature changes may exert strong influence on the timing of a variety of plant phenological events, especially those events that occur when temperature is most limiting, even in seasonally water-limited Mediterranean ecosystems.",,,,"Bridgham, Scott/R-1557-2017; Reed, Paul/AAI-9731-2020","Bridgham, Scott/0000-0003-0614-2678; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Such efforts can help meet many related goals, including habitat creation, ecosystem service provisioning, assisted migration, and the reintroduction of imperiled species following local extirpation. The outcomes of reintroduction efforts, however, are highly variable, with results ranging from local extinction to dramatic population growth; reasons for this variation remain unclear. Here, we ask whether population growth following plant reintroductions is governed by variation at two scales: the scale of individual habitat patches to which individuals are reintroduced, and larger among-landscape scales in which similar patches may be situated in landscapes that differ in matrix type, soil conditions, and other factors. Quantifying demographic variation at these two scales will help prioritize locations for introduction and, once introductions take place, forecast population growth. This work took place within a large-scale habitat fragmentation experiment, where individuals of two perennial forb species were reintroduced into eight replicate similar to 50-ha landscapes, each containing a set of five similar to 1-ha patches that varied in their degree of isolation (connected by habitat corridors or unconnected) and edge-to-area ratio. Using data on individual growth, survival, reproductive output, and recruitment collected one to two years after reintroduction, we developed models to forecast population growth, then compared forecasts to observed population sizes, three and six years later. Both the type of patch (connected and unconnected) and identity of the landscape to which individuals were reintroduced had effects on forecasted population growth rates, but only variation associated with landscape identity was an accurate predictor of subsequently observed population growth rates. Models that did not include landscape identity had minimal forecasting ability, revealing the key importance of variation at this scale for accurate prediction. Of the five demographic rates used to model population dynamics, seed production was the most important source of forecast error in population growth rates. Our results point to the importance of accounting for landscape-scale variation in demographic models and demonstrate how such models might assist with prioritizing particular landscapes for species reintroduction projects.",,,,,"Caughlin, T.

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite-based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale. The analysis is conducted in Spain using a spatially detailed, 12-year (2003-2015) dataset on crop yields, including different types of cereals. Yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), computed at different temporal aggregation levels, and two satellite-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area. Models resting on satellite-based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated. In particular, VCI/TCI models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70% and 40% of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability, respectively. We also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones (instead of models at the national scale) were considered. All the results were cross-validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real-time forecasting exercise. Results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite-based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems (e.g. agricultural drought early warning systems, crop yield forecasting models or water resource management tools) complementing meteorological drought indices derived from precipitation grids.",,,,"Garcia-Leon, David/V-1895-2018; Hunink, Johannes/F-4671-2012; Contreras, Sergio/E-6139-2010","Garcia-Leon, David/0000-0002-3205-7613; Hunink, Johannes/0000-0002-0878-0588; Contreras, Sergio/0000-0003-3991-8241",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

Observations and models of lake carbon pools and fluxes are rarely explicitly combined through data assimilation despite successful use of this technique in other fields. Data assimilation adds value to both observations and models by constraining models with observations of the system and by leveraging knowledge of the system formalized by the model to objectively fill observation gaps. In this article, we highlight the utility of data assimilation in lake carbon cycling research by using the ensemble Kalman filter to combine simple lake carbon models with observations of lake carbon pools and fluxes. We demonstrate that data assimilation helps reduce uncertainty in estimates of lake carbon pools and fluxes and more accurately estimate the true carbon pool size compared to estimates derived from observations alone.

This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.",,,,"Orr, Michael/AAF-7232-2019","Orr, Michael/0000-0002-9096-3008; Riemer, Kristina/0000-0003-3802-3331; Meiners, Joan/0000-0001-9369-9313; White, Ethan/0000-0001-6728-7745; Taylor, Shawn/0000-0002-6178-6903",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2019,100,2,,,,,,,UNSP e02568,10.1002/ecy.2568,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000457618800013,,,,,

Long time-series observations of plant phenology collected at continental scales could clarify latitudinal and regional patterns of plant responses and illuminate drivers of that variation, but few such datasets exist. Here, we use the web tool CrowdCurio to crowdsource phenological data from over 7000 herbarium specimens representing 30 diverse flowering plant species distributed across the eastern United States. Our results, spanning 120 years and generated from over 2000 crowdsourcers, illustrate numerous aspects of continental-scale plant reproductive phenology. First, they support prior studies that found plant reproductive phenology significantly advances in response to warming, especially for early-flowering species. Second, they reveal that fruiting in populations from warmer, lower latitudes is significantly more phenologically sensitive to temperature than that for populations from colder, higher-latitude regions. Last, we found that variation in phenological sensitivities to climate within species between regions was of similar magnitude to variation between species. Overall, our results suggest that phenological responses to anthropogenic climate change will be heterogeneous within communities and across regions, with large amounts of regional variability driven by local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and differences in species assemblages. As millions of imaged herbarium specimens become available online, they will play an increasingly critical role in revealing large-scale patterns within assemblages and across continents that ultimately can improve forecasts of the impacts of climatic change on the structure and function of ecosystems.

This chapter presents a critical review of the current seasonal crop yield forecasting methods found in the scientific literature. Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield forecast, particularly for wheat, maize, rice, barley, and soybean. Yield forecast are mainly based on field surveys, statistical regressions between historical yield and in-season variables (agrometeorological, or remotely sensed data), crop simulation models, or on integration between statistical modeling with dynamic process-based crop simulation models. A low number of studies rely on field surveys as a means to forecast yield, but they remain the main methods of yield forecast and estimation in several countries (i.e., USA).

Faustmann land expectation value (LEV) is a widely used criterion in forestry to evaluate a diversity of decision parameters, such as rotation age and thinning regimes. Most of the predictions and, consequently, expectations are based on emperical knowledge, assuming a steady state in climate and a deterministic forest growth approach. However, the climate may change to potentially different degrees in the coming decades, causing a dynamic and uncertain forest growth and carbon budget. Moreover, carbon economy in forestry, defined as opportunity cost of in situ carbon sequestration, can hardly be analysed using empirical models and calls for process-based forest biomass production models. Process-based models include numerous parameters and processes that embody some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty of these parameters and climate state propagates over time to the final decision about carbon economy and optimal management solutions. Here we quantify this uncertainty using Bayesian inference and apply twelve different climate change scenarios to evaluate the forecasts of the process-based forest model 3-PG, to predict the growth of European beech (Fagus Sylvatica) in central european conditions as an example. The results show a strong influence of the model's parameters uncertainty on the final decisions about timber based and carbon economy. The uncertainty triples if different climate change scenarios are applied as a source of deep uncertainty where no probability can be assigned to any scenario. To deal with deep uncertainty, a robust decision-making approach has been applied to find solutions with minimum regret or maximum value at risk regarding all scenarios. We conclude that communicating uncertainty is a fundamental issue for forestry economics under changing climate conditions, especially if carbon sequestration is an asset. The key message for designing global forest governance policy in the uncertain times of climate change will be the necessity to take into account both the uncertainty on the demand side, that is, socio-economic developments and regional population needs for forest ecosystem services such as wood, but also the uncertainty of the supply side and the inherent ecological uncertainties in predicting the forests' growth, resources, and climatic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J FOREST ECON,J.

Important innovations have been developed in recent years for detection of both invasive and native crayfish, mainly through eDNA, which allows for the detection of the target species even at low abundance levels and when not directly observable. Forecasting models have also moved towards the creation of realistic invasion scenarios, allowing effective management plans to be developed in advance of invasions. The importance of monitoring the spread and impacts of crayfish and pathogens in developing national data and research networks is emphasised; here citizen science can also play a role. Emerging techniques are still being considered in the field of invasive crayfish control. Although for decades the main traditional techniques to manage invasive crayfish were solely based on trapping, since 2010 biological, biocidal, autocidal controls and sexual attractants, monosex populations, RNA interference, the sterile male release technique and oral delivery have all also been investigated for crayfish control. In this review, ongoing methodologies applied to the detection and management of invasive crayfish are discussed, highlighting their benefits and limitations.",,,,"Anastacio, Pedro/B-4716-2008","Anastacio, Pedro/0000-0003-1808-3847; Giulianini, Piero Giulio/0000-0001-5356-7754; REYNOLDS, Julian/0000-0002-1590-5043",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,JAN,2019,11,1,,,,,,,5,10.3390/d11010005,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000459740700005,,,,,

The approximation offers a simple way to create tangent linear and adjoint model codes that are easily maintainable, as only major changes to the nonlinear model formulation necessitate modifications of the tangent linear or adjoint model code. The approach is particularly well suited to marine biogeochemical models and takes advantage of typical features of these types of models to be computationally viable. We illustrate the approximation in a realistic application, using a three-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical 4D-Var data assimilation system, set in the California Current system, in which the approximation is only applied to the 11 state variable biogeochemical model. In this application, the approximation-based model solution tracks the reference solution accurately over thirty 4-day assimilation cycles but leads to a similar to 10% increase in the computational cost compared to the hand-coded reference. Plain Language Summary Data assimilation refers to the process by which computer simulations of the Earth's atmosphere or ocean are constrained by measured data to be closer to the natural system. For example, in weather forecasting, measurements of the atmosphere are used to improve the computer model-generated forecast. Many data assimilation applications require extra computer code to calculate the appropriate adjustments shifting the model toward observations. This data assimilation code is time consuming to build; it must be updated whenever changes are made to the model code. We describe a relatively easy way to automatically generate the data assimilation code using only the underlying model code. Using this method, changes to the model code are automatically propagated to the data assimilation code. Although this approach is simple to construct and maintain, it comes at a cost of increased computer execution time. It is therefore not sensible for all computer models. We show that our approach is useful for marine biological models that simulate biological and chemical interactions in the ocean. For our biological model of the U.S. west coast, the automatically generated data assimilation code takes 10% longer to run than the assimilation code created by hand and results in functionally equivalent results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

We focus on Europe and on two crops, wheat and maize, in the period 1980-2010 under potential and water-limited conditions. In terms of inter-annual yield correlation at the country scale, the reanalysis-driven systems show a very good performance for both wheat and maize (with correlation values higher than 0.6 in almost all EU28 countries) when compared to the observations-driven system. However, significant yield biases affect both crops. All simulations show similar correlations with respect to the FAO reported yield time series.

The system-tested for the main European rice production districts in Italy, Greece, and Spain-performed satisfactorily; > 66% of the inter-annual yield variability was explained in six out of eight combinations of ecotype x district, with a maximum of 89% of the variability explained for the 'Tropical Japonica' cultivars in the Vercelli district (Italy). In seven out of eight cases, the assimilation of RS-derived LAI improved the forecasting capability, with minor differences due to the assimilation technology used (updating or recalibration). In particular, RS data reduced uncertainty by capturing factors that were not properly reproduced by the simulation model (given the uncertainty due to large-area simulations).

We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006-2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006-2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73%. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value < 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems.",,,,,"van der Velde, Marijn/0000-0002-9103-7081",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGR SYST,Agric.

Based on the temperature data, a simplest empirical model called the temperature-based method, was developed to forecast near-future ETo. Although temperature is one of the most influential weather variables in ETo forecasting, wind velocity also has non-ignorable impact on the forecast performance of ETo. Therefore, we employed the Reduced-set Penman-Monteith (RPM) model for short-term ETo forecasting using temperature data derived from public weather forecasts and wind speed data. Four different types of wind speed data were adopted as model inputs, including wind speed assumed as a default value, i.e., u(2) = 2.0 m s(-1) (W1), forecasted wind speed (W2), long-term daily average wind speed (W3) and annual average wind speed (W4). Based on the above-mentioned wind speed inputs, we presented four types of RPM models (RC, RF, RD and RM models respectively corresponding to W1, W2, W3 and W4) to forecast daily ETo for lead times up to 7 days for eight weather stations in China. The results confirmed that the highest precision wind speed input was W3, followed by W4, W1 and W2, and the most accurate ETo forecasts of four RPM models was provided by RC, followed with RD, RM and RF. By comparing with one of the most common used temperature-based models, the Hargreaves-Samani (HS), it was found that the performance of RPM approaches were better than that of HS model for arid and sub-arid regions whereas opposite results were found in sub-tropical area, suggesting inclusion of wind speed parameter makes positive impact on ETo forecast for arid and semi-arid regions. Further, it was found that the greatest type of RPM model, the RC model, was superior to HS method for most climate regions, including arid, humid, sub-arid and sub-humid areas, thus, the W1 wind speed type could be highly recommended for ETo forecasting for most climate regions.",,,,,"Luo, Yufeng/0000-0002-2401-1682",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

However, the modeling procedure was repeated for water salinity forecasting to evaluate the generality of the approach. The ensemble models are employed for forecasting purposes in Hilo Bay, Hawaii. Moreover, the efficacy of the forecasting models for up to three days in advance is investigated. To predict chlorophyll a and salinity with different lead, the previous daily time series up to three lags are decomposed via different wavelet functions to be applied as input parameters of the models. Further, outputs of the different wavelet-ANN models are combined using the least square boosting ensemble and Bates-Granger techniques to achieve more accurate and more reliable forecasts. To examine the efficiency and reliability of the proposed models for different lead times, uncertainty analysis is conducted for the best single wavelet-ANN and ensemble models as well. The results indicate that accurate forecasts of water temperature and salinity up to three days ahead can be achieved using the ensemble models. Increasing the time horizon, the reliability and accuracy of the models decrease.

Species distribution modelling has been regarded as a powerful tool to identify areas that provide suitable environmental conditions for the establishment of invaders. In this study, an ensemble species distribution model was developed for the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), by using 188 worldwide occurrence records and 11 environmental variables to predict its global potential distribution in freshwater habitats. The ensemble model showed high predictive performance and indicated that annual mean temperature was the most important environmental variable that limits the distribution of this invasive crustacean. The model successfully predicted the known distribution of Chinese mitten crab in its native range and invasive ranges and suggested that this invader has not yet fully realized its potential distribution in Europe and North America.

Australia is highly vulnerable to such impacts because of its very high prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitisation to environmental allergens such as certain pollens and fungal spores. This article aims to review published research on the impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases from an Australian perspective. Methods: Research on climate change, allergens and allergy was reviewed. Recent global assessments of the topic were consulted, and supplemented with database searches to identify research published since the assessments were done, as well as research with an Australian focus. The databases used were Web of Science and Scopus. Only research published since the year 2000 was included. Results: The impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases are many and varied. Impacts on pollen include effects on pollen production and atmospheric pollen concentration, pollen seasonality, pollen allergenicity, and the dispersion and spatial distribution of pollen. Similarly, there is evidence for effects on fungal spore production, seasonality and allergenicity. There are also likely effects on indoor moisture and mould growth. Beyond these respiratory allergens, climate change may also affect food allergens, stinging insect allergens and contact allergens. All these changes could affect allergic diseases, in particular allergic respiratory diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Conclusions: A large and sophisticated body of research exists from which to gauge both current and potential future impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases. However, most, if not all, of this is from outside Australia. Australian-focused research is therefore urgently needed. Australia's vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change on allergic diseases is compounded by the precarious nature of aeroallergen monitoring, reporting and forecasting in this country. But Australia has an impressive wealth of relevant experience and expertise, and has the potential to address the challenge of both current and future impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases.",,,,,"Beggs, Paul/0000-0001-9949-1783",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PUBLIC HEALTH RES PR,Public Health Res.

Along urban-to-rural transects in three regions of the northeastern United States, we recorded the presence of ragweed in 308 plots with different land uses: agriculture, developed, and forest. We also analyzed the effects of plot-level soil moisture, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and canopy cover on ragweed occurrence. Ragweed varied among land uses, but the effect of land use depended on the level of urbanization. The probability of ragweed occurrence was highest in urban forests, rural developed areas, and agricultural areas. Plot-level abiotic variables were not related to ragweed occurrence. Our results suggest that ragweed distributions are influenced to a greater extent by landscape-scale processes, such as propagule pressure and disturbance, than by macro-environmental effects of urbanization.

However, over large geographic regions, the most advanced models are often restricted by available computing resource. This limits capacity to undertake uncertainty analysis and prohibits the use of models in real-time ensemble forecasting systems. This study addresses these concerns by presenting an integrated system for the dynamic prediction and assessment of agricultural yield using the top-ranked Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer platform. This system enables parallelization and acceleration for the existing AquaCrop, DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition) and SWAP (Soil Water Atmosphere Plant) models, thus facilitating multi-model ensemble and parameter optimization and subsequent drought risk analysis in multiple regions and at multiple scales. The high computing capability also opens up the possibility of real-time simulation during droughts, providing the basis for more effective drought management. Initial testing with varying core group numbers shows that computation time can be reduced by between 2.6 and 3.6 times. Based on the powerful computing capacity, a county-level model parameter optimization (2043 counties for 1996-2007) by Bayesian inference and multi-model ensemble using BMA (Bayesian Model Average) method were performed, demonstrating the enhancements in predictive accuracy that can be achieved.

We also used remote sensing based vegetation index to extend the approach for early crop yield forecast purposes and to study the added value of proxy data on the predictive power of the statistical models. Using a stepwise linear regression-like method the most appropriate models were selected based on the statistical evaluation of the model fitting. We provided simple equations with well interpretable coefficients that can estimate crop yield with high accuracy. Cross-validated explained variance were 67% for winter wheat, 76% for rapeseed, 81% for maize and 68.5% for sunflower. The modelling exercise showed that positive anomaly of minimum temperature in May has a substantial negative effect on the final crop yield for all four crops. For winter wheat increasing maximum temperature in May has a beneficial effect, while higher-than-usual vapour pressure deficit in May decreases yield. For maize soil water content in July and August is crucial in terms of the final yield. Incorporation of the vegetation index improved the predictive power of the models at country scale, with 10%, 2% and 4% for winter wheat, rapeseed and maize, respectively. At the county level, remote sensing data improved the overall predictive power of the models only for winter wheat. The results provide simple yet robust models for spatially explicit yield forecast as well as yield projection for the near future.",,,,"Lichtenberger, Janos/K-1034-2018; Marjanovic, Hrvoje/C-9640-2017; Barcza, Zoltan/G-3880-2014; Kern, Aniko/M-8361-2014","Lichtenberger, Janos/0000-0001-9175-9255; Marjanovic, Hrvoje/0000-0001-5701-7581; Barcza, Zoltan/0000-0002-1278-0636; Kern, Aniko/0000-0002-3504-1668",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

Similarly, the ability to attach quantitative statements of uncertainty around model forecasts is crucial for model assessment and interpretation and for setting field research priorities. Bayesian methods provide a rigorous data assimilation framework for these applications, especially for problems with multiple data constraints. However, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques underlying most Bayesian calibration can be prohibitive for computationally demanding models and large datasets. We employ an alternative method, Bayesian model emulation of sufficient statistics, that can approximate the full joint posterior density, is more amenable to parallelization, and provides an estimate of parameter sensitivity. Analysis involved informative priors constructed from a meta-analysis of the primary literature and specification of both model and data uncertainties, and it introduced novel approaches to autocorrelation corrections on multiple data streams and emulating the sufficient statistics surface. We report the integration of this method within an ecological workflow management software, Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), and its application and validation with two process-based terrestrial ecosystem models: SIPNET and ED2. In a test against a synthetic dataset, the emulator was able to retrieve the true parameter values. A comparison of the emulator approach to standard ""bruteforce"" MCMC involving multiple data constraints showed that the emulator method was able to constrain the faster and simpler SIPNET model's parameters with comparable performance to the brute-force approach but reduced computation time by more than 2 orders of magnitude. The emulator was then applied to calibration of the ED2 model, whose complexity precludes standard (brute-force) Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Both models are constrained after assimilation of the observational data with the emulator method, reducing the uncertainty around their predictions. Performance metrics showed increased agreement between model predictions and data. Our study furthers efforts toward reducing model uncertainties, showing that the emulator method makes it possible to efficiently calibrate complex models.",,,,"Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; Richardson, Andrew D./F-5691-2011","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; Richardson, Andrew D./0000-0002-0148-6714; fer, istem/0000-0001-8236-303X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,4-Oct,2018,15,19,,,,,5801,5830,,10.5194/bg-15-5801-2018,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000446367500001,,,,,

Through reintroductions and natural dispersals, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have recolonized portions of their former range. Livestock grazing occurs on federal lands in the western United States, including 31% of wolf-occupied areas in Idaho, Montana, and Washington. We investigated characteristics of cattle (Bos taurus) grazing allotments (n = 70) in Idaho (2004-2008), Montana (1991-2008), and Washington (2008-2016) to predict cattle depredation risk on grazing allotments in current and probable wolf-occupied areas of Washington (n = 162). Depredation probability and the predicted number of cattle depredated increased for allotments with higher cattle and wolf abundance. Top models accurately predicted 38% (n = 8) of allotments with verified cattle depredations as >= 61% depredation probability. Assuming pack sizes of five or ten wolves, 10% (n = 16) and 15% (n = 24) of cattle grazing allotments in Washington were forecasted at >= 61% depredation probability, respectively. This preliminary study identified areas in which wildlife and rangeland management agencies can focus proactive depredation prevention measures. However, additional fine-scale data (e.g., GPS locations of depredation locations and wolf core areas, animal husbandry practices, actual number of cattle by age class) are needed to improve model performance and further evaluate cattle depredation risk by wolves on grazing allotments in Washington.

Biomass has been traditionally predicted by multi- and hyperspectral vegetation indices from low- and medium-resolution platforms. This research work aimed to assess the accuracy of the combined use of agro-climatic information and very high-resolution products obtained with RGB cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for biomass predictions in maize (Zea mays L.). Two agro-climatic predictors, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and growing degree days (GDDs), and twelve vegetation indices (VIs) derived from RGB bands were calculated for the entire growing cycle. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model that considers only GDD to estimate total dry biomass (TDB) was 692.7 g m(-2), which was reduced to 509.3 g m(-2) when introducing as predictor variables the VARI and GLI vegetation indices. Difficulties in the radiometric calibration of consumer grade RGB cameras together with sources of error such as the bidirectional reflectance distribution function and the blending algorithms in the photogrammetry processing could decrease the applicability of the obtained relationship and should be further evaluated.

Despite much study about when individual phenophases occur and how they may shift with climate change, little is known about how multiple phenophases relate to one another across an entire growing season. We test the extent to which early phenological stages constrain later ones, throughout a growing season, across 25 angiosperm tree species. We observed phenology (budburst, leafout, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) of 118 individual trees across 25 species, from April through December 2015. Key Results Conclusions We found that early phenological events weakly constrain most later events, with the strongest constraints seen between consecutive stages. In contrast, interphase duration was a much stronger predictor of phenology, especially for reproductive events, suggesting that the development time of flowers and fruits may constrain the phenology of these events. Much of the variation in later phenological events can be explained by the timing of earlier events and by interphase durations. This highlights that a shift in one phenophase may often have cascading effects on later phases. Accurate forecasts of climate change impacts should therefore include multiple phenophases within and across years.",,,,,"Wolkovich, Elizabeth M/0000-0001-7653-893X; Ettinger, Ailene/0000-0002-6228-6732",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AM J BOT,Am.

Invasive tree pests are increasingly threatening forest ecosystems. Understanding and controlling their spread presents a major challenge for managers, researchers, and policy makers. In 1999, the pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, causal agent of pine wilt disease and native to North America, was first detected in Europe, more precisely in south-western Portugal. Since then, it has spread to more than 30% of the country, producing large-scale damages in Portuguese forests. 2. We applied a new spatio-temporal network-based model to predict, at yearly intervals, the natural spread of the PWN on the Iberian Peninsula, as dispersed by the longhorn beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis, its only known vector in Europe. We compared the model predictions with independent observations of the natural spread of pine wilt disease in Portugal between 2005 and 2015. We simulated the effect of potential containment measures on the disease spread. 3. The model predicted the status (infected or non-infected) of forest areas with 93% accuracy, had 93% sensitivity and specificity, and AUC=0.96 (averages for 8 years with validation data). 4. Simulated clear-cut belts stopped the spread only if they were wider than 30 km, although thinner belts delayed invasion. Furthermore, clear-cuts were much more effective in slowing down the invasion when reinforced, in the adjacent areas, by the reduction in the vector beetle population through mass trapping and by the early detection and removal of infected trees. 5. Model projections identified areas through which the nematode is most likely to invade, by natural means, the phytosanitary buffer zone established along the Portuguese border, and Spain. 6. Synthesis and applications. In the absence of effective containment measures, the pine wood nematode may naturally spread into Spain in about 5 years. In less than 10 years, it may reach the major forest and climatic corridors that provide a gateway for subsequent expansion towards the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and, in the longer term, towards other European countries. Our model can considerably support management efforts by forecasting when areas are at highest risk of vector-mediated invasion as well as the effects of specific control measures on the disease spread.",,,,"Saura, Santiago/A-9994-2008","Saura, Santiago/0000-0002-5239-0763",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are an increasingly popular technique to infer interaction strengths between species in a community and to predict the community response to environmental change. The most commonly employed MAR(1) models, with one time lag, can be viewed either as multispecies competition models with Gompertz density dependence or, more generally, as a linear approximation of more complex, nonlinear dynamics around stable equilibria. This latter interpretation allows for broader applicability, but may come at a cost in terms of interpretation of estimates and reliability of both short- and long-term predictions. 2. We investigate what these costs might be by fitting MAR(1) models to simulated 2-species competition, consumer-resource and host-parasitoid systems, as well as a larger food web influenced by the environment. We review how MAR(1) coefficients can be interpreted and evaluate how reliable are estimates of interaction strength, rank, or sign; accuracy of short-term forecasts; as well as the ability of MAR(1) models to predict the long-term responses of communities submitted to environmental change such as PRESS perturbations. 3. The net effects of species j on species i are usually (90%-95%) well recovered in terms of sign or rank, with the notable exception of overcompensatory dynamics. In actual values, net effects of species j on species i are not well recovered when the underlying dynamics are nonlinear. MAR(1) models are better at making short-term qualitative forecasts (next point going up or down) than at predicting long-term responses to environmental perturbations, which can be severely over- as well as underestimated. 4. We conclude that when applying MAR(1) models to ecological data, inferences on net effects among species should be limited to signs, or the Gompertz assumption should be tested and discussed. This particular assumption on density-dependence (log-linearity) is also required for unbiased long-term predictions. Overall, we think that MAR(1) models are highly useful tools to resolve and characterize community dynamics, but we recommend to use them in conjunction with alternative, nonlinear models resembling the ecological context in order to improve their interpretation in specific applications.",,,,"Barraquand, Frederic/G-1599-2011","Barraquand, Frederic/0000-0002-4759-0269",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Here, we develop a forecast for the biomass change in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests of the southeastern United States and evaluate the relative contribution of different forms of uncertainty to the total forecast uncertainty. Specifically, we assimilated observations of carbon and flux stocks and fluxes from sites across the region, including global change experiments, into a forest ecosystem model to calibrate the parameter distributions and estimate the process uncertainty (i.e., model structure uncertainty revealed in the residuals of the calibration). Using this calibration, we forecasted the change in biomass within each 12-digit Hydrologic (H12) unit across the native range of loblolly pine between 2010 and 2055 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Averaged across the region, productivity is predicted to increase by a mean of 31% between 2010 and 2055 with an average forecast 95% quantile interval of +/- 15 percentage units. The largest increases were predicted in cooler locations, corresponding to the largest projected changes in temperature. The forecasted mean change varied considerably among the H12 units (3-80% productivity increase), but only units in the warmest and driest extents of the loblolly pine range had forecast distributions with probabilities of a decline in productivity that exceeded 5%. By isolating the individual components of the forecast uncertainty, we found that ecosystem model process uncertainty made the largest individual contribution. Ecosystem model parameter and climate model uncertainty had similar contributions to the overall forecast uncertainty, but with differing spatial patterns across the study region. The probabilistic framework developed here could be modified to include additional sources of uncertainty, including changes due to fire, insects, and pests: processes that would result in lower productivity changes than forecasted here. Overall, this study presents an ecological forecast at the ecosystem management scale so that land managers can explicitly account for uncertainty in decision analysis. Furthermore, it highlights that future work should focus on quantifying, propagating, and reducing ecosystem model process uncertainty.",,,,"Wynne, Randolph H/A-8966-2009","Wynne, Randolph H/0000-0003-3649-835X; Thomas, R.

Nevertheless, traditional stock-recruitment relationships lack predictive power for these stocks. Current management of Atlantic menhaden explicitly treats recruitment as a random process. However, traditional methods for understanding recruitment variability carry the very specific hypothesis that the effect of adult biomass on subsequent recruitment occurs independently of other ecosystem factors such as food availability and predation. Here, we evaluate the predictability of menhaden recruitment using a model-free approach that is not restricted by these strong assumptions. We find that menhaden recruitment is predictable, but only when allowing for interdependence of stock with other ecological factors. Moreover, while the analysis confirms the presence of environmental effects, the environment alone does not readily account for the complexity of menhaden recruitment dynamics. The findings set the stage for revisiting recruitment prediction in management and serve as an instructive example in the ongoing debate about how to best treat and understand recruitment variability across species and fisheries.",,,,,"Ye, Hao/0000-0002-8630-1458",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FISH FISH,Fish.

We explicitly compare the 5-day forecasting skill of three runs of a physical-biogeochemical model: (a) a free reference run, (b) a run with daily data assimilation (DA) of total surface chlorophyll (ChlTot), and (c) a run with daily PFTs DA. We show that small total chlorophyll model bias hides comparatively large biases in PFTs chlorophyll, which ChlTot DA fails to correct. This is because the ChlTot DA splits the assimilated total chlorophyll into PFTs by preserving their simulated ratios, rather than taking account of the observed PFT concentrations. Unlike ChlTot DA, PFTs DA substantially improves model representation of PFTs chlorophyll. During forecasting the DA reanalysis skill in representing PFTs chlorophyll degrades toward the free run skill; however, PFTs DA outperforms free run within the whole 5-day forecasting period. We validated our results with in situ data, and we demonstrated that (in both DA cases) the DA substantially improves the model representation of CO2 fugacity (PFTs DA more than ChlTot DA). ChlTot DA has a positive impact on the representation of silicate, while the PFTs DA seems to have a negative impact. The impact of DA on nitrate and phosphate is not significant.

This paper presents a method for the short-term forecasting of ETc using a single-crop coefficient approach and public weather forecasts. Temperature forecasts with a 7-day lead time in 2013-2015 were retrieved and entered into a calibrated Hargreaves-Samani model to compute daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) forecasts, while crop coefficient (K-c) empirical values were estimated from both observed ETc value and calculated ET0 values using the Penman-Monteith equation for the period of 2010-2012. Daily ETc forecasts of irrigated double-cropping rice were determined for three growing seasons during the period of 2013-2015 and were compared with ETc values measured by the weighing lysimeters at the Jiangxi experimental irrigation station in southeastern China. During the early rice season, the average mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values of ETc forecasts ranged from 0.95 to 1.06 mm day(-1) and from 1.18 to 1.31 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average correlation coefficient (R) ranged from 0.39 to 0.54; for late rice, the average MAE and RMSE values ranged from 1.01 to 1.09 mm day(-1) and from 1.32 to 1.40 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average R value ranged from 0.54 to 0.58. There could be three factors responsible for errors in ETc forecasts, including temperature forecast errors, K-c value errors and neglected meteorological variables in the HS model, including wind speed and relative humidity. In addition, ETc was more sensitive to changes in temperature than K-c.

Here we explore initializing directly on a model's own attractor, using an analog approach in which model states close to the observed initial state are drawn from a ""library'' obtained from prior uninitialized CGCM simulations. The subsequent evolution of those ""model-analogs'' yields a forecast ensemble, without additional model integration. This technique is applied to four of the eight CGCMs comprising the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) by selecting from prior long control runs those model states whose monthly tropical Indo-Pacific SST and SSH anomalies best resemble the observations at initialization time. Hindcasts are then made for leads of 1-12 months during 1982-2015. Deterministic and probabilistic skill measures of these model-analog hindcast ensembles are comparable to those of the initialized NMME hindcast ensembles, for both the individual models and the multimodel ensemble. In the eastern equatorial Pacific, model-analog hindcast skill exceeds that of the NMME. Despite initializing with a relatively large ensemble spread, model-analogs also reproduce each CGCM's perfect-model skill, consistent with a coarse-grained view of tropical Indo-Pacific predictability. This study suggests that with little additional effort, sufficiently realistic and long CGCM simulations provide the basis for skillful seasonal forecasts of tropical Indo-Pacific SST anomalies, even without sophisticated data assimilation or additional ensemble forecast integrations.

To evaluate benefits, we compared crop growth and net income of this proposed scheme to those of an automated irrigation method using soil water sensors. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.), cv. Kintoki) was grown in 2016 in a sandy field of the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University, Japan under either a non-optimized automated irrigation or the proposed scheme. Under the proposed scheme, 18% less water was applied, yield increased by 19%, and net income was increased by 25% compared with the results of the automated irrigation system.

Recent assimilation efforts have shown that updating model physics alone can degrade biogeochemical fields while only updating biogeochemical variables may not improve a model's predictive skill when the physical fields are inaccurate. Here we systematically investigate whether multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical model states are superior to only updating either physical or biogeochemical variables. We conducted a series of twin experiments in an idealized ocean channel that experiences wind-driven upwelling. The forecast model was forced with biased wind stress and perturbed biogeochemical model parameters compared to the model run representing the ""truth"". Taking advantage of the multivariate nature of the deterministic Ensemble Kalman Filter (DEnKF), we assimilated different combinations of synthetic physical (sea surface height, sea surface temperature and temperature profiles) and biogeochemical (surface chlorophyll and nitrate profiles) observations. We show that when biogeochemical and physical properties are highly correlated (e.g., thermocline and nutricline), multivariate updates of both are essential for improving model skill and can be accomplished by assimilating either physical (e.g., temperature profiles) or biogeochemical (e.g., nutrient profiles) observations. In our idealized domain, the improvement is largely due to a better representation of nutrient upwelling, which results in a more accurate nutrient input into the euphotic zone. In contrast, assimilating surface chlorophyll improves the model state only slightly, because surface chlorophyll contains little information about the vertical density structure. We also show that a degradation of the correlation between observed subsurface temperature and nutrient fields, which has been an issue in several previous assimilation studies, can be reduced by multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical fields.",,,,"Fennel, Katja/A-7470-2009; Bertino, Laurent PV/H-9395-2014","Fennel, Katja/0000-0003-3170-2331; Bertino, Laurent PV/0000-0002-1220-7207; Yu, Liuqian/0000-0002-5492-8213",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCEAN MODEL,Ocean Model.,JUN,2018,126,,,,,,13,28,,10.1016/j.ocemod.2018.04.005,,,,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,,,WOS:000433242000002,,,,,

We developed a hierarchical Bayesian approach to determine variation in the timing and quantity of fruit production. Our analysis accommodates missing censuses and quantifies variation at seasonal and inter-annual scales. The fruiting peak of 22 of 45 species occurred during the peak of the rainy season, which is typical for central and eastern Amazon. The timing and quantity of fruit production varied substantially across years in most species, with greater variation in quantity than in timing. The timing of fruit production varied from continuously fruiting species to mast fruiting species that had two or more consecutive years without fruit production. Fully 40% of species were mast fruiting species. The seasonal timing and inter-annual variation in fruiting were unrelated to seed dispersal mode across species. We saw no evidence for directional change in the level of fruit production, the timing of fruit production, or their variances; however, 10yr is a short record for such analyses.

In large lakes, even extensive monitoring programs leave some of the patterns undiscovered and unresolved. Lake models can complement measurements in higher spatial and temporal resolution. These models require a set of driving data, particularly meteorological input data, which are compulsory to the models but at many locations not available at the desired scale or quality. It remains an open question whether these meteorological input data can be acquired in a sufficient quality by employing atmospheric models. In this study, we used the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data as meteorological forcing for the three-dimensional hydrodynamic General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). With this combination, we modelled the spatio-temporal variation in water temperature in the large, shallow Lake Chaohu, China. The model succeeded in reproducing the seasonal patterns of cooling and warming. While the model did predict diurnal patterns, these patterns were not precise enough to correctly estimate the extent of short stratification events. Nevertheless, applying reanalysis data proved useful for simulating general patterns of stratification dynamics and seasonal thermodynamics in a large shallow lake over the year. Utilising reanalysis data together with hydrodynamic models can, therefore, inform about water temperature dynamics in the respective water bodies and, by that, complement local measurements.",,,,"Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Frassl, Marieke Anna/D-8494-2018","Rinke, Karsten/0000-0003-0864-6722; Frassl, Marieke Anna/0000-0001-8843-8477",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2018,10,5,,,,,,,594,10.3390/w10050594,,,,Water Resources,,,WOS:000435196700060,,,,,

Tests were made on two mesotrophic lakes in the English Lake District, which differ in depth and nutrient regime.

There was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods.

Using ecoregion-scale estimates of North American vegetation activity inferred from remote sensing (1982-2015), we examined seasonal and spatial relationships between land surface phenology and the atmospheric components of five teleconnection patterns over the tropical Pacific, north Pacific, and north Atlantic. Using a set of regression experiments, we also tested for interactions among these teleconnection patterns and assessed predictability of vegetation activity solely based on knowledge of atmospheric teleconnection indices. Autumn-to-winter composites of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were strongly correlated with start of growing season timing, especially in the Pacific Northwest. The two leading modes of north Pacific variability (the Pacific-North American, PNA, and West Pacific patterns) were significantly correlated with start of growing season timing across much of southern Canada and the upper Great Lakes. Regression models based on these Pacific teleconnections were skillful predictors of spring phenology across an east-west swath of temperate and boreal North America, between 40 degrees N-60 degrees N. While the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was not strongly correlated with start of growing season timing on its own, we found compelling evidence of widespread NAO-SOI and NAO-PNA interaction effects. These results suggest that knowledge of atmospheric conditions over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans increases the predictability of North American spring phenology. A more robust consideration of the complexity of the atmospheric circulation system, including interactions across multiple ocean basins, is an important step towards accurate forecasts of vegetation activity.",,,,"Wise, Erika K/A-5858-2012; Dannenberg, Matthew/G-8826-2016","Wise, Erika K/0000-0002-1712-7476; Dannenberg, Matthew/0000-0002-6518-4897",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

This study explored (1) the relative contributions of model forcing data and parameters to uncertainty in forecasting flux- versus pool-based carbon cycle variables and (2) the time points when temperature and CO2 treatments may cause statistically detectable differences in those variables. We developed an online forecasting workflow (Ecological Platform for Assimilation of Data (EcoPAD)), which facilitates iterative data-model integration. EcoPAD automates data transfer from sensor networks, data assimilation, and ecological forecasting. We used the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Experiments data collected from 2011 to 2014 to constrain the parameters in the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, forecast carbon cycle responses to elevated CO2 and a gradient of warming from 2015 to 2024, and specify uncertainties in the model output. Our results showed that data assimilation substantially reduces forecasting uncertainties. Interestingly, we found that the stochasticity of future external forcing contributed more to the uncertainty of forecasting future dynamics of C flux-related variables than model parameters. However, the parameter uncertainty primarily contributes to the uncertainty in forecasting C pool-related response variables. Given the uncertainties in forecasting carbon fluxes and pools, our analysis showed that statistically different responses of fast-turnover pools to various CO2 and warming treatments were observed sooner than slow-turnover pools.

Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure.

While the number of forecasts for biodiversity is increasing, there is little information available on how well these forecasts work. Most biodiversity forecasts are not evaluated to determine how well they predict future diversity, fail to account for uncertainty, and do not use time-series data that captures the actual dynamics being studied. We addressed these limitations by using best practices to explore our ability to forecast the species richness of breeding birds in North America. We used hindcasting to evaluate six different modeling approaches for predicting richness. Hindcasts for each method were evaluated annually for a decade at 1,237 sites distributed throughout the continental United States. All models explained more than 50% of the variance in richness, but none of them consistently outperformed a baseline model that predicted constant richness at each site. The best practices implemented in this study directly influenced the forecasts and evaluations. Stacked species distribution models and ""naive"" forecasts produced poor estimates of uncertainty and accounting for this resulted in these models dropping in the relative performance compared to other models. Accounting for observer effects improved model performance overall, but also changed the rank ordering of models because it did not improve the accuracy of the ""naive"" model. Considering the forecast horizon revealed that the prediction accuracy decreased across all models as the time. horizon of the forecast increased.

We also compared lambda projections for C. guianensis seed and timber harvest scenarios to those from previous MPMs for this economically valuable multiple-use tree species. Changes in the time interval of the MPM resulted in larger changes in lambda than changes in environmental conditions between years. The only exception to this trend was when representing impacts of a 2005 fire. Fire had a more severe impact on lambda when modeled with IPMs. The lambda(IPM) estimated in 2005-9 was 0.8122, almost 0.1 lower than the lambda(MPM) of 0.9115. The management implications of this research were mixed. Both MPM and IPM results indicated declining populations of C. guianensis even before simulated harvests.

The implicit assumption is that this will increase knowledge and, in turn, lead to better decision-making. However, the justification for this assumption remains uncertain, not least because the definition of 'prediction' is unclear. We propose that two types of prediction should be distinguished: corroboratory-prediction is linked to the validation of theories; and anticipatory-prediction is linked to the description of possible futures. We then discuss four families of obstacles to prediction, linked to the specific features of ecosystems: 1) they are historical entities, 2) they are complex, 3) their dynamics are stochastic, and 4) they are influenced by socio-economic drivers. A naive understanding of ecological science suggests that the two types of predictions are simply two phases in a sequence in which scientists first improve their knowledge of ecological systems via corroboratory-predictions, and then apply this knowledge in order to forecast future states of ecosystems via anticipatory-predictions in order to help policy makers taking decisions. This sequence is however not straightforward, partly because corroboration and anticipation are not affected by the obstacles to prediction in the same way. We thus invite to reconsider the role of ecological prediction as a tool in a deliberative model of decision-making rather than as external scientific information aimed at enlightening the political process. Doing so would be beneficial for both the policy-relevance of anticipatory-prediction and the theoretical-relevance of corroboratory-prediction.",,,,"Pradel, Roger/A-8666-2008","Pradel, Roger/0000-0002-2684-9251; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2018,127,2,,,,,171,183,,10.1111/oik.04655,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000423848100001,,,,,

Climate uncertainty is expected to have a severe impact on the economy of West African countries. The use of forecasting in agricultural production has become a priority for those working in the field of development. This article focuses on the early prediction of cotton production levels before harvesting in Senegal, using expertise from the cotton development company, SODEFITEX. Objectives. This paper aims to analyze the knowledge employed to predict yield, given the uncertainty about future climate conditions, and to evaluate the quality of such predictions, depending on the territorial scale of the expertise considered. Method. The methodology used in this study was a statistical analysis of cotton production in Senegal between 2004 and 2015, combined with a survey of 32 SODEFITEX experts. Results. Analysis of the survey of experts revealed that their evaluation of the cotton production was based mainly on the state of the crops and on crop management, with the planting date being the priority. For some experts, the history of production and its organizational and social environments were also important factors. A comparison of forecasts with actual production showed that the experts had systematically overestimated the levels of production when actual yields were below 1,000 kg-ha(-1), under adverse climatic conditions. Conclusions. Within a context of poor scientific documentation of the early estimation of production by experts, the results of the study shed light on the knowledge drawn upon and the performance of the forecasts delivered, thus paving the way for a rational criticism of the expertise employed. The diversity of points of view highlighted by the multi-criteria analysis, between hierarchical levels and between agents at the same level, underlines the need for a closer look at the knowledge being utilized, in order to bring out ""what matters"" in these forecasts and to move towards greater objectivity of expertise in the face of recurrent climate hazards.",,,,,"Loison, Romain/0000-0001-6562-658X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BIOTECHNOL AGRON SOC,Biotechnol.

The gridded Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), gridded maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures, defined on a monthly basis, were used to assess climatic variability. Different vegetation classes were studied separately: grasslands, holm oak and cork oak, shrubland, deciduous forests and other evergreen forests. Type-specific models were developed to represent NDVI variability, using lagged monthly anomalies (up to 6 mo) of SPEI, TX and TN as exploratory variables. For southern Portugal, occupied mainly by grassland and low density woodland, vegetation greenness is very sensitive to precipitation. This sensitivity is particularly clear in February-March and September. Conversely, in the northwestern regions, where shrubland and evergreen/deciduous forests prevail, vegetation greenness is much less sensitive to precipitation seasonality. After cross-validation, the type specific vegetation models explained 50-88% of the observed NDVI variability (relative errors of 3-7%). Models showed that SPEI significantly correlates with vegetation greenness at 3 and 6 mo timescales. At the same timescales, anomalously low TX and, to a much lower extent, anomalously high TN tend to favour vegetation greenness. It is thus possible to predict vegetation greenness in Portugal, up to 3 mo in advance and for different vegetation types, with some accuracy. A thorough understanding of the relationships between vegetation greenness and precipitation variability may promote a better management of forest/agroforestry systems, water resources, ecosystems and landscapes, particularly under changing climates.",,,,"Fernandes, Paulo M./A-6948-2008; Santos, Joao Andrade/G-8805-2011; Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012","Fernandes, Paulo M./0000-0003-0336-4398; Santos, Joao Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078; Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLIM RES,Clim.

However, expert judgements can be prone to contextual biases. Structured elicitation protocols mitigate these biases, and improve the accuracy and transparency of the resulting judgements. Despite this, the elicitation of expert judgement within conservation and natural resource management remains largely informal. We suggest this may be attributed to financial and practical constraints, which are not addressed by many existing structured elicitation protocols. In this paper, we advocate that structured elicitation protocols must be adopted when expert judgements are used to inform science. In order to motivate a wider adoption of structured elicitation protocols, we outline the IDEA protocol. The protocol improves the accuracy of expert judgements and includes several key steps which may be familiar to many conservation researchers, such as the four-step elicitation, and a modified Delphi procedure (Investigate, Discuss, Estimate and Aggregate). It can also incorporate remote elicitation, making structured expert judgement accessible on a modest budget. The IDEA protocol has recently been outlined in the scientific literature; however, a detailed description has been missing. This paper fills that important gap by clearly outlining each of the steps required to prepare for and undertake an elicitation. While this paper focuses on the need for the IDEA protocol within conservation and natural resource management, the protocol (and the advice contained in this paper) is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains, as evidenced by its application to biosecurity, engineering and political forecasting. By clearly outlining the IDEA protocol, we hope that structured protocols will be more widely understood and adopted, resulting in improved judgements and increased transparency when expert judgement is required.",,,,"Hanea, Anca/AAI-5294-2020","Hanea, Anca/0000-0003-3870-5949; Wintle, Bonnie/0000-0003-0236-6906",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Cattle depredation risk increased with cattle abundance and if the pack depredated cattle the previous year.

During the summer grazing season (1 May - 31 October) when most cattle depredations (97%; n = 34) occurred in Washington, cattle east of the Cascade Mountains were often on grazing allotments whereas cattle west of the Cascade Mountains were located on small, private farms. Thus, relative cattle abundance per grazing allotment and county likely represented cattle depredation risk east and west of the Cascade Mountains, respectively. County-wide and allotment cattle abundance forecasted 10.3% and 1.4% of probable wolf-occupied areas at >= 61% cattle depredation risk, respectively.

While the direct effects of environmental drivers on fish early life stage survival can be quantified experimentally, indirect effects in marine ecosystems and the role of adaptation are still highly uncertain. We developed an integrative model for the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the early life stages of Atlantic cod in the Barents Sea, termed SCREI (Simulator of Cod Recruitment under Environmental Influences). Experimental results on temperature and CO2 effects on egg fertilization, egg and larval survival and development times are incorporated. Calibration using empirical time series of egg production, temperature, food and predator abundance reproduces age-0 recruitment over three decades. We project trajectories of recruitment success under different scenarios and quantify confidence limits based on variation in experiments. A publicly accessible web version of the SCREI model can be run under www.oceanchange.uni-bremen.de/SCREI. Severe reductions in average age-0 recruitment success of Barents Sea cod are projected under uncompensated warming and acidification toward the middle to end of this century. Although high population stochasticity was found, considerable rates of evolutionary adaptation to acidification and shifts in organismal thermal windows would be needed to buffer impacts on recruitment. While increases in food availability may mitigate short-term impacts, an increase in egg production achieved by stock management could provide more long-term safety for cod recruitment success. The SCREI model provides a novel integration of multiple driver effects in different life stages and enables an estimation of uncertainty associated with interindividual and ecological variation. The model thus helps to advance toward an improved empirical foundation for quantifying climate change impacts on marine fish recruitment, relevant for ecosystem-based assessments of marine systems under climate change.",,,,"Portner, Hans-O./K-9429-2016; Clemmesen, Catriona/B-1480-2014; Stiasny, Martina/O-4988-2018","Portner, Hans-O./0000-0001-6535-6575; Clemmesen, Catriona/0000-0003-4102-7341; Stiasny, Martina/0000-0001-6365-2610",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

A comprehensive evaluation was developed and applied using Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) tidal turbine site as a case study of a developing industry with no standard monitoring methods. Before-After monitoring datasets that contained change were simulated using normal and non-normal empirical baseline data collected at a MRE site. Thirteen regression models from three classes were evaluated: 6 generalized regression models, 4 time series models, and 3 non parametric models. Intervention Analysis was used to fit models to five change scenarios that included three amplitudes of change and a lag in the onset of change. A power analysis was used to evaluate model ability to detect change. Residual error diagnostics were used to quantify model fit and forecast accuracy. Parametric models that did not include lagged dependent variables were the most capable at detecting change. A comparison of the fit and forecast metric results indicated that deterministic time series models in conjunction with semi-parametric generalized regression models provided a robust and informative quantification of change. Nonparametric models most accurately forecasted change. The results provide insight on model behavior, which is used to recommend specific models to measure change in the case study data. These recommendations form best practices for analyzing monitoring data, which enables comparisons among monitoring sites and reduces uncertainty when quantifying environmental effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach China has been the most populous country for hundreds of years. And this state will be sustained in the forthcoming decade. Obviously, China is confronted with greater pressure on controlling total scale of population than any other country. Meanwhile, controlling population will be beneficial for not only China but also the whole world. This paper first analyzes general development trend of China's population total amount, sex ratio and aging ratio. The mechanism for measurement of the impact effect of a policy shock disturbance is proposed. Linear regression model, exponential curve model and grey Verhulst model are adopted to test accuracy of simulation of China's total population. Then considering the policy shock disturbance on population, discrete grey model, DGM (1, 1), and grey Verhulst model were adopted to measure how China's one-child policy affected its total population between 1978 and 2015. And similarly, the grey Verhulst model and scenario analysis of economic developing level were further used to forecast the effect of adjustment from China's one-child policy to two-child policy. Findings Results show that China has made an outstanding contribution toward controlling population; it was estimated that China prevented nearly 470 million births since the late 1970s to 2015. However, according to the forecast, with the adjustment of the one-child policy, the birth rate will be a little higher, China's total population was estimated to reach 1,485.59 million in 2025. Although the scale of population will keep increasing, but it is tolerable for China and sex ratio and trend of aging will be relieved obviously. Practical implications The approach constructed in the paper can be used to measure the effect of population change under the policy shock disturbance. It can be used for other policy effect measurement problems under shock events' disturbance. Originality/value The paper succeeded in studying the mechanism for the measurement of the post-impact effect of a policy and the effect of changes in China's population following the revision of the one-child policy. The mechanism is useful for solving system forecasting problems and can contribute toward improving the grey decision-making models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2018,47,3,,,,,559,586,,10.1108/K-05-2017-0159,,,,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",,,WOS:000426083200008,,,,,

Thus, monitoring and precise prediction of the occurrence of this disease are important; early prediction of the disease would be especially helpful for prevention. Here, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based model for rice blast disease prediction. Historical data on rice blast occurrence in representative areas of rice production in South Korea and historical climatic data are used to develop a region-specific model for three different regions: Cheolwon, Icheon and Milyang. A rice blast incidence is then predicted a year in advance using long-term memory networks (LSTMs). The predictive performance of the proposed LSTM model is evaluated by varying the input variables (i.e., rice blast disease scores, air temperature, relative humidity and sunshine hours). The most widely cultivated rice varieties are also selected and the prediction results for those varieties are analyzed. Application of the LSTM model to the accumulated rice-blast disease score data confirms successful prediction of rice blast incidence. In all regions, the predictions are most accurate when all four input variables are combined. Rice blast fungus prediction using the proposed LSTM model is variety-based; therefore, this model will be more helpful for rice breeders and rice blast researchers than conventional rice blast prediction models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2018,10,1,,,,,,,34,10.3390/su10010034,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,WOS:000425082600033,,,,,

Previous applications of analog forecasting has been successful at producing robust forecasts for a variety of ecological and physical processes, but it has typically been presented in an empirical or heuristic procedure, rather than as a formal statistical model. The methodology presented here extends the model-based analog method of McDermott and Wikle (Environmetrics, 27, 2016, 70) by placing analog forecasting within a fully hierarchical statistical framework that can accommodate count observations. Using a Bayesian approach, the hierarchical analog model is able to quantify rigorously the uncertainty associated with forecasts. Forecasting waterfowl settling patterns in the northwestern United States and Canada is conducted by applying the hierarchical analog model to a breeding population survey dataset.

This disparity in complexity between ecosystem models and data has created a large gap in ecology between model and data-driven approaches. Here, we explore data assimilation (DA) with the Ensemble Kalman filter to fuse a two-predator-two-prey model with abundance data from a 2600+ day experiment of a plankton community.

Models are therefore required to provide full spatial coverage, and through data assimilation can be combined with observations to create a reanalysis. This can then be used to investigate both observed and non observed variables, including those relating to the carbon cycle. As part of the Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG) within the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, two global marine biogeochemical reanalyses have been produced by assimilating ocean colour-derived chlorophyll data into a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model over the period September 1997 to July 2012. One reanalysis assimilated CCI products, the other assimilated GlobColour products, with a non-assimilative hindcast run for comparison. Each has been validated against independent in situ observations of chlorophyll, nutrients and carbon cycle variables. The assimilation of either source of ocean colour data was found to improve the model's representation of chlorophyll concentration throughout the water column, including the frequency and positioning of deep chlorophyll maxima. The assimilation also resulted in a slight improvement in nutrient concentrations and surface fugacity of carbon dioxide compared with in situ observations, although the overall impact on mean fields was small. This was found to be due in part to cancelling errors within the model, with the assimilation providing information on model biases, which can be used to inform future climate model development. The reanalyses were also able to reproduce expected seasonal cycles, as well as inter-annual variability related to major climate drivers. This study concludes that both CCI and GlobColour products are suitable for assimilation purposes, and that assimilating ocean colour data is of clear benefit.

This is particularly problematic when ecological models are used to make conservation and management plans whose outcomes may depend strongly on model formulation. Nonlinear time series approaches allow us to circumvent this issue by using the observed dynamics of the system to guide policy development. However, these methods typically require long time series from stationary systems, which are rarely available in ecological settings. Here we present a Bayesian approach to nonlinear forecasting based on Gaussian processes that readily integrates information from several short time series and allows for nonstationary dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling methods on simulated from a wide range of ecological scenarios.

To adapt to what the future holds and to manage the impacts of global change, scientists need to predict the expected effects with some confidence and communicate these predictions to policy makers. However, recent reviews found that we currently lack a clear understanding of how predictable ecology is, with views seeing it as mostly unpredictable to potentially predictable, at least over short time frames. However, in applied, ecology-related fields predictions are more commonly formulated and reported, as well as evaluated in hindsight, potentially allowing one to define baselines of predictive proficiency in these fields. We searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields and collected information about modeling approaches, target variables of prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the more predictive fields proficiency is evaluated in different ways. Both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology.

Predicting how increasing rates of global trade will result in new establishments of potentially damaging invasive species is a question of critical importance to the development of national and international policies aimed at minimizing future invasions. Centuries of historical movement and establishment of invading species may have depleted the supply of species available for future invasions, and it has been suggested that the problem of invasions will diminish as a result of this. However, the extent to which source pool depletion affects future invasions remains unclear. 2. Here we describe a mechanistic model that captures the simultaneous effects of depletion of source species pools along with increases in pathway rates (e.g. imports) to predict future numbers of new invasions. We assume that the distribution of species abundance within invasion pathways is positively skewed, which is modelled using a log-normal distribution. Given their high propagule pressure, the most abundant species are likely to invade first, while the many rare species are likely to invade only under high pathway volumes. We apply this model to the case study of bark beetle, Scolytinae, invasions in the USA. 3. Source species pools in Europe and Asia (225 and 655 species of Scolytinae, respectively) are much larger than numbers that have historically established (16 and 32). Parameterization of the model indicates a highly skewed species abundance distribution in the pathway and this is confirmed by species frequencies in port inspection records, thus explaining why only a small fraction of species has historically invaded. 4. Forecasts from the model indicate that with increasing rates of imports, more species from these regions are likely to invade in the future despite the depletion of the most abundant species from source species pools. Previous statistical models tend to underestimate future establishments in the presence of increasing import rates due to their failure to account for key underlying mechanisms. 5. Policy implications. The mechanistic model developed here is widely applicable for predicting future invasions of all taxa and provides insights into how increases in rates of imports counteract the species pool depletion effect, resulting in the continued establishment of new species.",,,,"Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/C-1528-2009","Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/0000-0002-5962-3208",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

To calibrate and validate the gene-expression code, important meteorological data and weather forecast information were collected from the local meteorological station and public weather media, respectively. The GEP algebraic formulation was successfully constructed based only on daily minimum and maximum air temperature using the true FAO56 Penman-Monteith (PM) set as reference values. The performance of the models was then assessed using the correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), root relative squared error (RRSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The study demonstrated that GEP is able to calibrate ETo (all errors <= 0.990 mm/day, R = 0.832-0.866) and forecast the daily ETo with good accuracy (RMSE = 1.207 mm/day, MAE = 0.902 mm/day, RRSE = 0.629 mm/day, R = 0.777).

This optimization approach was conducted by presenting the change of chlorophyll value rather than the base value of chlorophyll as the output variable of the network. Both of the optimized and traditional networks had been applied to a case study. The results of model performance indices show that the optimized network predicts better than the traditional network.

We investigated the climatic drivers of demographic fluctuations in a forest tree defoliator, the pine pro cessionary moth (PPM), in 8 biogeographical regions in France. We studied the effects of precipitation and temperature for both cold and warm periods, in accordance with PPM biology. We trained second-order log linear models of infestation dynamics based on records spanning over 32 years (1981-2014) and 1239 forest plots, and tested their forecast accuracy on two additional years (2013-2014). PPM population growth rate decreased with higher precipitations in 5 regions and increased with increasing temperatures in the cold period in 4 regions. The magnitude and direction of temperature effects in the warm period varied among biogeographical regions. Our results also revealed that PPM population dynamics were largely triggered by density-dependent factors independent from climatic drivers.

When the 10- to 30-day-ahead predicted concentrations of cyanobacteria cells or cyanotoxins exceed pre-defined limit values, an early warning automatically activates an action plan considering in-lake control, e.g. intermittent mixing and ad hoc water treatment in water works, respectively. Case studies of the sub-tropical Lake Wivenhoe (Australia) and the Mediterranean Vaal Reservoir (South Africa) demonstrate that ensembles of inferential models developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA are capable of up to 30 days forecasts of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins using data collected in situ. The resulting models for Dolicospermum circinale displayed validity for up to 10 days ahead, whilst concentrations of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and microcystins were successfully predicted up to 30 days ahead. Implementing the proposed scheme for drinking water reservoirs enhances current water quality monitoring practices by solely utilising in situ monitoring data, in addition to cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin measurements. Access to routinely measured cyanotoxin data allows for development of models that predict explicitly cyanotoxin concentrations that avoid to inadvertently model and predict non-toxic cyanobacterial strains.

Linear approaches are fundamentally based on correlation. Thus, they are ill-posed for dynamical systems, where correlation can occur without causation, and causation may also occur in the absence of correlation. ""Mirage correlation"" (i.e., the sign and magnitude of the correlation change with time) is a hallmark of nonlinear systems that results from state dependency. State dependency means that the relationships among interacting variables change with different states of the system. In recent decades, nonlinear methods that acknowledge state dependence have been developed. These nonlinear statistical methods are rooted in state space reconstruction, i.e. lagged coordinate embedding of time series data. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system but recover the dynamics from time series data, thus called empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). EDM bears a variety of utilities to investigating dynamical systems. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for EDM applications with rEDM, a free software package written in the R language. Using model examples, we aim to guide users through several basic applications of EDM, including (1) determining the complexity (dimensionality) of a system, (2) distinguishing nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems, and quantifying the nonlinearity (i.e. state dependence), (3) determining causal variables, (4) forecasting, (5) tracking the strength and sign of interaction, and (6) exploring the scenario of external perturbation.

The geographical range of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is expanding, both through human mediated vectors and by natural dispersal. The species is now spreading in Scandinavia. In order to optimize the management of the oyster, including targeted monitoring and mitigation activities, knowledge on the present and future distribution and impact on the ecosystem is important. The development of the population and the potential impacts on native ecosystems were analyzed, based on the present scientific knowledge on the distribution in Scandinavia, data on new settlements and existing literature. Data was first evaluated by 14 experts (including the authors) during a workshop, relating the current status of habitats where Pacific oysters are found in Scandinavia (Low energy rock, Littoral sand and mudflats, Littoral biogenic reefs, Sublittoral sand and Sublittoral biogenic reefs) to a predicted development, thereafter assessed in relation to impact on the habitats. The assessment was done as a function of climate change in a longterm IPCC climate scenario (A1B). We conclude that Littoral biogenic reefs are at risk to obtain the highest expected increase, while all other habitats are at risk of low to moderate development of the oyster populations. Accordingly, Littoral Biogenic reefs was assessed as the habitat type at risk of the largest ecosystem effects as high densities of oysters already exist in these areas, and the densities are expected to increase rapidly until reaching a threshold density. Low energy rock and Littoral sand and mud were assessed as being subjected to moderate to high ecosystem effects. Sub-littoral sand and Sub-littoral biogenic reefs were assessed as currently being at risk of moderate ecosystem effects as there are low densities of oysters in these habitats, although densities in sublittoral biogenic reefs has the potential to increase.

Furthermore, due to the inherent spatial variability that exists in the field, combining measurements taken at different locations in the field usually leads to large uncertainty around the mean value. These factors, together with the fact that crop-soil models are strongly non-linear, render assimilation of measurements in crop-soil models non-trivial. This work presents procedures for performing such data assimilation, using the crop model AquaCrop as specific example. The procedures are based on Extended Kalman Filter, with some heuristic adjustments, and enable re-initialisation of state variables and/or adjustments of selected parameters of the model. The uncertainties of the measurements are taken into account explicitly in the proposed assimilation scheme. The procedures were tested with data obtained from experiments conducted with potato in Denmark and cotton in Greece. In both cases the data available consisted of canopy cover and biomass (average and standard deviation on 5-10 days), and a locally calibrated AquaCrop model was used as starting point for the assimilation process. The results demonstrate the soundness of the approach but also emphasise the inherent limitations associated with data assimilation. In particular, assimilation of easy-to-obtain canopy cover measurements did not always improve the predictions of biomass. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The framework is used to make a number of novel predictions and reframe approaches to experimental design, model selection, and hypothesis testing. Next, the quantitative application of the framework to partitioning uncertainties is illustrated using a short-term forecast of net ecosystem exchange.

Despite their wide application in ecology and conservation biology, the inference and projection of these models may be problematic when residual spatial auto correlation (SAC) is found. We aimed to improve the inference and projection of population dynamics models by accounting for residual SAC. We considered three Gompertz models that incorporated density dependence and the effect of wetland habitat to explain and project the abundance of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). We compared a conventional model that did not account for residual SAC (ENV) with two novel models accounting for residual SAC, one incorporating a spatial effect (a spatially autocorrelated process error) that did not vary over time (STA) and the other incorporating a spatial effect that varied over time (DYN). We evaluated model inference using data from 1974 to 1998 and projection using data from 1999 to 2010. We then forecasted Mallard abundance from 2011 to 2100 under different levels of wetland habitat loss. The DYN model eliminated residual SAC and had better model fit than the ENV and STA models (Delta(D) over bar = 2498.3 and 1988.8, respectively). The projection coverage rate of the DYN model was the closest to the nominal value among the three models. The DYN model forecasted smaller areas with decrease in Mallard abundance under future wetland habitat loss than the ENV and STA models. The novel and conventional population dynamics models we considered in this study, combined with the practical model evaluation approach, can provide reliable inference and projection of wildlife abundance, and thus have wide application in ecological studies and conservation practices that aim to understand and project the spatiotemporal variation of wildlife abundance under environmental changes. In particular, when conservation decision-making is based on model projections, the DYN may be used to minimize the risk of reducing conservation effort in areas that still have high conservation value, due to its favorable projection performance.

Macroecology, which deals with biological patterns and processes at a large scale, is ideally suited to address this global phenomenon, thus providing a more general and generalizable understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. To date, a macroecological approach to examining phenological changes based on historical ground observations remains mostly unexplored, as the phenological studies have been conducted at local scales, while the recent new technologies, e.g., remote sensing, can extend phenological study to global scales. Because phenology is probably the most widely used bioindicator of climate change, thus allowing for studies at the macroscale. Some meta-analyses have indeed employed broad-scale, long-term datasets to estimate overall shift rates in the timing of plant and animal phenological events. However, none has provided a convincing macroecological view of current phenological shifts, and few attempts have been made to make global-scale predictions of phenological responses under future climatic scenarios. Understanding spatial variability and clines may be essential for comprehending phenological variations stemming from future climate change.

Two model ensembles have been designed to predict the response of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii to modified flow regimes of the River Nakdong (Korea) by a scenario analysis. Whilst flow-independent predictor variables of growth of Microcystis and Stephanodiscus such as water temperature and pH remain unchanged during the scenario analysis, flow-dependent predictor variables such as turbidity, electrical conductivity, phosphate, nitrate, silica and chlorophyll a are forecasted by inferential models. In the course of scenario analysis, flow-independent and flow-dependent predictor variables feed into the Microcystis and Stephanodiscus models to make sure that both direct and indirect effects of altered flow regimes are taken into account. The eight inferential models that were incorporated into the model ensembles have been developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on 19years of time-series monitored in the River Nakdong between 1993 and 2012. The models achieved good accuracy in terms of timing and magnitudes reflected by coefficients of determination r(2)=0.94 for Microcystis and r(2)=0.83 for Stephanodiscus. The scenario analysis revealed that extreme summer blooms of Microcystis as observed between 1994 and 1997, and winter blooms of Stephanodiscus as observed between 1994 and 1997 and in 2004 can be prevented in the River Nakdong by adaptive management of seasonal water release from adjacent dams.

In recent years niche-based models (NBMs) have been used to predict species distribution and are an important tool for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. In this work, the current and future climatic suitability areas of the invasive species Corbicula fluminea, which has known adverse ecological and economic impacts, were investigated. The species distribution modelling was based on nine algorithms in BIOMOD2, summarized in an ensemble forecasting approach. To model the species distribution, eight climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation variables were considered. Three time frames (current, 2050 and 2070) were modelled using four increasing CO2 emission scenarios. The performance of individual models was excellent according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and good to excellent according to true skill statistics (TSS). Annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important variables predicting C. fluminea occurrence. Of the total continental area, 6.6% was predicted to be suitable for C. fluminea in current conditions. In the future, suitable area will increase from the current value of 6.6% to values from 9.4% to 12.6%, according to the 2050 projections and up to 12.7% in 2070 in high emission scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that climate change will favour the expansion of C. fluminea into new river basins, especially at higher latitudes, and that future climatic scenarios may double the suitable area for Corbicula fluminea.",,,,"Dolbeth, Marina/AAF-7501-2019; de Jesus Andrade e Crespo, Daniel/O-2627-2017; Anastacio, Pedro/B-4716-2008; CIIMAR, BYT/N-6498-2017","Dolbeth, Marina/0000-0002-8775-0351; de Jesus Andrade e Crespo, Daniel/0000-0003-4402-5229; Anastacio, Pedro/0000-0003-1808-3847; CIIMAR, BYT/0000-0002-3703-4402; Gama, Mafalda/0000-0001-8682-1923",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

However, the mechanistic basis for niche shifts during invasion is poorly understood and has rarely been captured within species distribution models. We quantified the consequence of between-population variation in phenology for invasion of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) across Europe. Ragweed is of serious concern because of its harmful effects as a crop weed and because of its impact on public health as a major aeroallergen. We developed a forward mechanistic species distribution model based on responses of ragweed development rates to temperature and photoperiod. The model was parameterized and validated from the literature and by reanalyzing data from a reciprocal common garden experiment in which native and invasive populations were grown within and beyond the current invaded range. It could therefore accommodate between-population variation in the physiological requirements for flowering, and predict the potentially invaded ranges of individual populations. Northern-origin populations that were established outside the generally accepted climate envelope of the species had lower thermal requirements for bud development, suggesting local adaptation of phenology had occurred during the invasion. The model predicts that this will extend the potentially invaded range northward and increase the average suitability across Europe by 90% in the current climate and 20% in the future climate. Therefore, trait variation observed at the population scale can trigger a climatic niche shift at the biogeographic scale. For ragweed, earlier flowering phenology in established northern populations could allow the species to spread beyond its current invasive range, substantially increasing its risk to agriculture and public health. Mechanistic species distribution models offer the possibility to represent niche shifts by varying the traits and niche responses of individual populations. Ignoring such effects could substantially underestimate the extent and impact of invasions.",,,,"Chapman, Daniel S/C-2900-2008; Bullock, James M/F-9997-2011; Chapman, Daniel/O-5100-2019","Chapman, Daniel S/0000-0003-1836-4112; Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2017,98,6,,,,,1671,1680,,10.1002/ecy.1835,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000402299300018,,,,,

Modeling potential distributions of invasive weeds can prioritize locations for monitoring and control efforts, increasing management efficiency. Forecasts of invasion risk at regional to continental scales are enabled by readily available downscaled climate surfaces together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrence records and species distribution modeling techniques. However, predictions at a finer scale and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Contemporary remote sensing (RS) data can enhance predictions by providing a range of spatial environmental data products at fine scale beyond climatic variables only. In this study, we used the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and empirical maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models to model the potential distributions of 14 invasive plant species across Southeast Asia (SEA), selected from regional and Vietnam's lists of priority weeds. Spatial environmental variables used to map invasion risk included bioclimatic layers and recent representations of global land cover, vegetation productivity (GPP), and soil properties developed from Earth observation data. Results showed that combining climate and RS data reduced predicted areas of suitable habitat compared with models using climate or RS data only, with no loss in model accuracy. However, contributions of RS variables were relatively limited, in part due to uncertainties in the land cover data. We strongly encourage greater adoption of quantitative remotely sensed estimates of ecosystem structure and function for habitat suitability modeling. Through comprehensive maps of overall predicted area and diversity of invasive species, we found that among lifeforms (herb, shrub, and vine), shrub species have higher potential invasion risk in SEA. Native invasive species, which are often overlooked in weed risk assessment, may be as serious a problem as non-native invasive species. Awareness of invasive weeds and their environmental impacts is still nascent in SEA and information is scarce. Freely available global spatial datasets, not least those provided by Earth observation programs, and the results of studies such as this one provide critical information that enables strategic management of environmental threats such as invasive species.",,,,,"Andrew, Margaret/0000-0003-3285-3684; Hardy, Giles/0000-0001-7419-5064",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Although large algal blooms can have significant negative impacts on ecosystems and human health, a predictive understanding of these events has eluded science, and many have come to regard them as ultimately random phenomena. However, the highly nonlinear nature of ecological dynamics can give the appearance of randomness and stress traditional methods-such as model fitting or analysis of variance-to the point of breaking. The intractability of this problem from a classical linear standpoint can thus give the impression that algal blooms are fundamentally unpredictable. Here, we use an exceptional time series study of coastal phytoplankton dynamics at La Jolla, CA, with an equation-free modeling approach, to show that these phenomena are not random, but can be understood as nonlinear population dynamics forced by external stochastic drivers (so-called ""stochastic chaos"").

We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants' distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source-sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline.

In the case of seeds with a high economic value, as is the case of ""nuts from the Mediterranean stone pine (Pinus pinea L), predispersal predation can also result in severe economic losses. The insect-seed relationship shows complex spatiotemporal dynamics, including patterns of dependency between fruit availability and fluctuations in insect population, occurrence of insect outbreaks, spatial contagion and masting habit. In the present study, we focus on the damage caused by a native pest, the Dioryctria mendacella Stgr. moth, to cones and seeds of P. pinea, a forest species showing a marked masting habit. We firstly identified those environmental and stand-level factors controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of damage by D. mendacella, as well as the self-regulatory effect that interannual variability in seed production could have on the population dynamics of the moth. In a second phase, we constructed a predictive phenomenological model to forecast the probability of cone damage in a given location, as well as the expected patterns of spatiotemporal spread and dispersion. Our results revealed a strong correlation between the probability of damage and crop size in a given year, pointing to a dependency between feeding resources and predator population. Additionally, the probability of damage is affected by the number of damaged cones observed in the previous year, indicating temporal contagion. Cone and seed damage is also affected by the temperature during different phases of the complex life-cycle of D. mendacella, which suggests that breakout processes are synchronized within the territory and linked to the occurrence of bumper crops and favorable climatic conditions. We detected that the level of infestation at a given location is related to site and environmental conditions, with no significant pattern of contagion/spreading from stands with high resource availability to those with low availability. Damage prediction under warmer climate scenarios reveals a counterbalance among favorable/unfavorable conditions for insect expansion and expected decline in cone production, resulting in only slight changes.

The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set.

Such predictions present opportunities for improved LMR management and industry operations, as well as new research avenues in fisheries science. LMRs respond to climate variability via changes in physiology and behavior. For species and systems where climate-fisheries links are well established, forecasted LMR responses can lead to anticipatory and more effective decisions, benefitting both managers and stakeholders. Here, we provide an overview of climate prediction systems and advances in seasonal to decadal prediction of marine-resource relevant environmental variables. We then describe a range of climate-sensitive LMR decisions that can be taken at lead-times of months to decades, before highlighting a range of pioneering case studies using climate predictions to inform LMR decisions. The success of these case studies suggests that many additional applications are possible. Progress, however, is limited by observational and modeling challenges. Priority developments include strengthening of the mechanistic linkages between climate and marine resource responses, development of LMR models able to explicitly represent such responses, integration of climate driven LMR dynamics in the multi-driver context within which marine resources exist, and improved prediction of ecosystem relevant variables at the fine regional scales at which most marine resource decisions are made. While there are fundamental limits to predictability, continued advances in these areas have considerable potential to make LMR managers and industry decision more resilient to climate variability and help sustain valuable resources. Concerted dialog between scientists, LMR managers and industry is essential to realizing this potential. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-period Landsat-8 OLT images were collected at two different wheat growth stages, and a field campaign was conducted to obtain grain yields at selected sampling sites in 2014. The field data were divided into a calibration database and a testing database. Using calibration data, a cross-validation concept was introduced for the PLSR and ANN model construction to prevent over-fitting. All models were tested using the test data. The ANN yield-prediction model produced R-2, RMSE and RMSE% values of 0.61, 979 kg ha(-1), and 10.38%, respectively, in the testing phase, performing better than the PLSR yield-prediction model, which produced R-2, RMSE, and RMSE% values of 0.39, 1211 kg ha(-1), and 12.84%, respectively.

At present, technologically comprehensive forecasting estimates are generated using process-based ecological models. However, isolation of the ecological factors that cause uncertainty in model behavior is difficult. To solve this problem, this study aimed to construct a meliorization model evaluation framework to explain uncertainty in model behavior with respect to both the mechanisms and algorithms involved in ecological forecasting based on the principle of landsenses ecology. We introduce a complicated ecological driving mechanism to the process-based ecological model using analytical software and algorithms. Subsequently, as a case study, we apply the meliorizationmodel evaluation framework to detect Eucalyptus biomass forest patches at a regional scale (196,158 ha) using the 3PG2 (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) model. Our results show that this technique improves the accuracy of ecological simulation for ecological forecasting and prevents new uncertainties from being produced by adding a new driving mechanism to the original model structure. This result was supported by our Eucalyptus biomass simulation using the 3PG2 model, in which ecological factors caused 21.83% and 9.05% uncertainty in model behavior temporal and spatial forecasting, respectively. In conclusion, the systematic meliorization model evaluation framework reported here provides a new method that could be applied to research requiring comprehensive ecological forecasting.

To decrease the cost of aquatic environmental monitoring and increase the accuracy of bloom forecasting, a novel single-parameter approach combining wavelet analysis with artificial neural networks (WNN) was developed and verified based on daily online monitoring datasets of algal density in the Siling Reservoir, China and Lake Winnebago, U.S.A. Firstly, a detailed modeling process was illustrated using the forecasting of cyanobacterial cell density in the Chinese reservoir as an example. Three WNN models occupying various prediction time intervals were optimized through model training using an early stopped training approach. All models performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial cell density, with the best model predicting cyanobacteria density one-day ahead (r = 0.986 and mean absolute error = 0.103 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)). Secondly, the potential of this novel approach was further confirmed by the precise predictions of algal biomass dynamics measured as chl a in both study sites, demonstrating its high performance in forecasting algal blooms, including cyanobacteria as well as other blooming species. Thirdly, the WNN model was compared to current algal forecasting methods (i.e. artificial neural networks, autoregressive integrated moving average model), and was found to be more accurate. In addition, the application of this novel single-parameter approach is cost effective as it requires only a buoy-mounted fluorescent probe, which is merely a fraction (-15%) of the cost of a typical auto-monitoring system. As such, the newly developed approach presents a promising and cost-effective tool for the future prediction and management of harmful algal blooms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Literature on the bloom prediction and forecasting has been accumulating and the emphasis appears to have been on the relation between the blooms and environmental factors, whilst the complexity of the bloom mechanism makes it difficult to reach adequate output of the models. Rapid development of next generation sequencing techniques provides a way in which comprehensive and quick examination of the microbial community can be achieved, especially for the bloom community structure. This facilitates using of merely the sequence data along with the machine learning techniques to predict and forecast the bloom occurrence. But there has been rare report on this theme in the literature. In this case study, machine learning approaches were applied with the metagenomic data as the only input (rather than with environmental data) to predict the Cyanobacteria blooms. k-NN classification, SVM classification and k-means clustering were applied and their efficiencies were evaluated using relevant indices. Feature selection was performed and the yielded sub datasets were worked on seriatim. In the predicting experiment with k-NN approach, the final year's data among the 8 years OTU time series were used as target data and various combination of the preceding years' data were used as predictor data; the output came with the best values of 1.00 and 100% for the evaluation indices F1score and sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, for the 7 preceding years' predictor input, among the experiment results. This case study demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning approaches in the Cyanobacteria bloom prediction with only metagenomic sequence data, and the importance of feature selection processing in obtaining better output of the machine learning approaches.

Chemical control of this disease remains the most effective rice blast management method. Many attempts have been made to develop models to forecast rice blast. A review of literature of the rice blast forecasting models revealed that 52 studies have been published, with the majority capable of predicting only leaf blast. The most frequent input variable has been air temperature, followed by relative humidity and rainfall. Critical factors for the pathogenesis, such as leaf wetness, nitrogen fertilization and variety resistance have had limited integration in the development of these models. This review reveals low rates of model application due to inaccuracies and uncertainties in the predictions. Five models are part of current operational forecasting systems in Japan, Korea and India.

During a marine heat wave in 2012, the fishery was disrupted by the early warming of spring ocean temperatures and subsequent influx of lobster landings. This situation resulted in a price collapse, as the supply chain was not prepared for the early and abundant landings of lobsters. Motivated by this series of events, we have developed a forecast of when the Maine (USA) lobster fishery will shift into its high volume summer landings period. The forecast uses a regression approach to relate spring ocean temperatures derived from four NERACOOS buoys along the coast of Maine to the start day of the high landings period of the fishery. Tested against conditions in past years, the forecast is able to predict the start day to within 1 week of the actual start, and the forecast can be issued 3-4 months prior to the onset of the high landings period, providing valuable lead-time for the fishery and its associated supply chain to prepare for the upcoming season. Forecast results are conveyed in a probabilistic manner and are updated weekly over a 6-week forecasting period so that users can assess the certainty and consistency of the forecast and factor the uncertainty into their use of the information in a given year. By focusing on the timing of events, this type of seasonal forecast provides climate-relevant information to users at time scales that are meaningful for operational decisions. As climate change alters seasonal phenology and reduces the reliability of past experience as a guide for future expectations, this type of forecast can enable fishing industry participants to better adjust to and prepare for operating in the context of climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Skilful forecasts ranging from seasonal (3 months) to decadal (5-10 years) time scales are now a reality. With the advance of these forecasts of ocean physics, the first generation of marine ecological forecasts has started to emerge. Such forecasts are potentially of great value in the management of living marine resources and for all of those who are dependent on the ocean for both nutrition and their livelihood; however, this is still a field in its infancy. We review the state of the art in this emerging field and identify the lessons that can be learnt and carried forward from these pioneering efforts. The majority of this first wave of products are forecasts of spatial distributions, possibly reflecting the inherent suitability of this response variable to the task of forecasting. Promising developments are also seen in forecasting fish-stock recruitment where, despite well-recognized challenges in understanding and predicting this response, new process knowledge and model approaches that could form a basis for forecasting are becoming available. Forecasts of phenology and coral-bleaching events are also being applied to monitoring and industry decisions. Moving marine ecological forecasting forward will require striking a balance between what is feasible and what is useful. We propose here a set of criteria to quickly identify 'low hanging fruit"" that can potentially be predicted; however, ensuring the usefulness of forecast products also requires close collaboration with actively engaged end-users. Realizing the full potential of marine ecological forecasting will require bridging the gaps between marine ecology and climatology on the one-hand, and between science and end-users on the other. Nevertheless, the successes seen thus far and the potential to develop further products suggest that the field of marine ecological forecasting can be expected to flourish in the coming years.",,,,"Tommasi, Desiree/M-1668-2015; Payne, Mark/C-6844-2008; Liu, Gang/E-7921-2011","Tommasi, Desiree/0000-0003-4027-6047; Payne, Mark/0000-0001-5795-2481; Liu, Gang/0000-0001-8369-6805; Miesner, Anna K./0000-0002-2213-4312; MacKenzie, Brian/0000-0002-4798-0363",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

This poses a challenge for agencies charged with management and conservation of these species. Specialized diets, restricted ranges, or reliance on specific substrates or sites (e.g., for pupping) make many marine mammal populations particularly vulnerable to climate change. High-latitude, predominantly ice-obligate, species have experienced some of the largest changes in habitat and distribution and these are expected to continue. Efforts to predict and project marine mammal distributions to date have emphasized data-driven statistical habitat models. These have proven successful for short time-scale (e.g., seasonal) management activities, but confidence that such relationships will hold for multi decade projections and novel environments is limited. Recent advances in mechanistic modeling of marine mammals (i.e., models that rely on robust physiological and ecological principles expected to hold under climate change) may address this limitation. The success of such approaches rests on continued advances in marine mammal ecology, behavior, and physiology together with improved regional climate projections. The broad scope of this challenge suggests initial priorities be placed on vulnerable species or populations (those already experiencing declines or projected to undergo ecological shifts resulting from climate changes that are consistent across climate projections) and species or populations for which ample data already exist (with the hope that these may inform climate change sensitivities in less well observed species or populations elsewhere). The sustained monitoring networks, novel observations, and modeling advances required to more confidently project marine mammal distributions in a changing climate will ultimately benefit management decisions across time-scales, further promoting the resilience of marine mammal populations.",,,,"Fiechter, Jerome/AAM-7786-2020","Lettrich, Matthew/0000-0003-4749-2260",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

We demonstrate that an existing multi-annual prediction system skillfully forecasts the probability of next year, the next 1-3 years, and the next 1-10 years being warmer or cooler than the 50-year average at the surface in coastal ecosystems. Probabilistic forecasts of upper and lower seas surface temperature (SST) terciles over the next 3 or 10 years from the GFDL CM 2.1 10-member ensemble global prediction system showed significant improvements in skill over the use of a 50-year climatology for most Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) in the North Atlantic, the western Pacific, and Indian oceans. Through a comparison of the forecast skill of initialized and uninitialized hindcasts, we demonstrate that this skill is largely due to the predictable signature of radiative forcing changes over the 50-year timescale rather than prediction of evolving modes of climate variability.

However, little work has focused on the systematic evaluation of how well adult mosquito abundance can be predicted as a function of observational resolutions, aggregation scales, and prediction lead time. We use a state space reconstruction (SSR) approach to compare the predictability of mosquito population dynamics at weekly, biweekly, and monthly scales. We focus on the analysis of Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura populations monitored in Brunswick County (North Carolina, USA) and find that prediction over a 7-d lead time is improved when daily observations are used, compared to the commonly used once-per-week sample. Our results demonstrate that daily observations of mosquito abundance contribute to improving mosquito predictability in two ways: (1) daily observations better capture fluctuations over short timescales, which are missed when sampling at coarser resolutions, and (2) the aggregation of daily abundance observations reduces the impact of noise, thereby increasing the predictability of mosquito population dynamics as the aggregation scale is increased. We show that the evaluation of population dynamical models based on observed and predicted abundance can lead to a spuriously high apparent performance, due to the high autocorrelation in the observations used to update the model state at each successive time step. We show that the comparison of predicted and observed population change, expressed through per capita growth rates, leads to a more informative performance measure.",,,,"Marani, Marco/F-9451-2016; Marani, Marco/S-6125-2019","Marani, Marco/0000-0002-1493-6913; Marani, Marco/0000-0002-1493-6913; SILVESTRI, SONIA/0000-0002-5114-8633",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The forecast time horizon ranges from 24-h ahead (one day) to 168-h ahead (seven days). The proposed OP-ELM model is compared to the standard multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with respect to their capabilities of forecasting DO in the Klamath River at Miller Island Boat Ramp, Oregon, USA. To demonstrate the forecasting capability of OP-ELM and MLPNN models, we used a long-term data set of hourly DO data for a ten-year period, from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2013, collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS Stations No: 420,853,121,505,500 [Top] and 420,853,121,505,501 [Bottom]). For developing the models, we split the data set into a training subset (from 2004 to 2010) that corresponded to 70 %, and a validation (from 2011 to 2013) that corresponded to 30 % of the total data set. We investigated the performance and accuracy of the proposed two models for three different horizons, i.e., short-term, medium-term and long-term forecasting; a total of six different models (FM1 to FM6), having the same data sets as inputs, were developed for short-term (24 h to 48 h), medium-term (72 h to 96 h) and long-term (120 h to 168 h) horizons. Input variables used in the six models were the six antecedent DO concentrations at (t-5), (t-4), (t-3), (t-2), (t-1) and (t). The performance of the OP-ELM and MLPNN models in training and validation sets were compared with the observed data. To get more accurate evaluation of the results of the two models, the following seven statistical performance indices were used: the coefficient of correlation (R), the Willmott index of agreement (d), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the bias error (Bias), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The study reveals that OP-ELM and MLPN provided good results and they were successful in forecasting DO at a high level of accuracy. The reliability of forecasting decreased with increasing the step ahead. The measures of model performance fell within the acceptable ranges for the two stations. Regarding the fact that researches on medium and long-term forecasting are relatively limited, the present work aims to build and provide a good early warning system capable of preventing DO depletion and the associated problems of anoxia and hypoxia in river. Furthermore, the proposed forecasting models, when implemented appropriately, could be reliably used in detecting future change in DO concentration in rivers.",,,,"HEDDAM, SALIM/B-8647-2015","HEDDAM, SALIM/0000-0002-8055-8463",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENVIRON PROCESS,Environ.

Mathematical and statistical models play a critical role in this process by integrating data from multiple sources in a way that is honest about uncertainty. We show the utility of Bayesian hierarchical models for supporting decisions on managing natural resources of national parks. These models can assimilate monitoring data to provide true forecasts, resulting in probabilistic predictions of future states of park ecosystems accompanied by rigorous estimates of uncertainty. We discuss a novel approach for communicating these forecasts to decision makers who need to evaluate the probability that NPS goals will be met given different management actions, including the null model of no action. We illustrate how this approach has been used successfully to inform decisions on the elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population management in Rocky Mountain National Park based on 47 yr of monitoring data. Forecasts from a discrete time, stage-structured population model assimilated with annual census and sex and age classifications are being used annually to help park managers decide on actions needed to meet goals for elk and vegetation. In particular, park managers were able to determine the probability that the elk population would fall within a desired population range, which led to both population reduction actions and no action depending on the year of interest. Moreover, this approach allowed multiple survey methodologies from the last 47 years to be incorporated into a single model with associated estimates of uncertainty.

We forecasted daily 7-day-ahead ETo using the Penman-Monteith (PM) model and public weather forecasts. Public weather forecast data, including daily maximum and minimum temperatures, weather types and wind scales, for six stations located in a wide range of climate zones of China were collected. Weather types and wind scales were converted to sunshine duration and wind speed to forecast ETo. Meanwhile, daily meteorological data for the same period and locations were collected to calculate ETo, which served as reference standard for evaluating forecasting performance. The results showed that the forecasting performance for the minimum temperature was the best, followed by maximum temperature, sunshine duration and wind speed. Also, it was found that using public weather forecasts and the PM model improved the forecasting performance of daily ETo compared to those obtained when using the HS model with temperature forecasts as the only input data, and this improvement was because the weather type and wind scale forecasts also have positive influence on ETo forecasting. Further, the greatest impact on ETo forecasting error was found to be caused by the errors in sunshine duration and wind speed, followed by maximum and minimum temperature forecasts.

Both microalgae are associated with toxic events. Therefore, understanding their population dynamics and predict their occurrence in short-term is crucial for an optimal management of toxic events for the local shellfish production and ecosystem managers. Artificial neural networks have been successfully used to model the complex nonlinear dynamics of phytoplankton. In this study, this approach was applied to predict absence-presence and abundance of Karlodinium and Pseudo-nitzschia microalgae in Alfacs Bay (NW Mediterranean) using biological and/or environmental variables. Neural Interpretation Diagram (NID) and Connection Weight Approach (CWA) methodologies were applied to obtain ecological information from the models. The dataset used was long-term (1990-2015) time series of environmental and phytoplankton variables from different monitoring stations established in Alfacs Bay (Ebre Delta), meteorological data and Ebre River flow rates. Several models were presented. The best ones were achieved for one-week ahead procedures performed with environmental and biological variables using all the available data. A sensitivity analysis showed the larger the data set used, the better the models obtained. However, Karlodinium absence presence models developed with five years of data present high accuracy. The size of the neural networks denotes complex relationships between environmental and phytoplankton variables. The environmental variables had stronger influence on the abundance models while biological variables had more importance in the absence-presence models. These results highlight a complex ecosystem in Alfacs Bay involving anthropogenic, climatic and hydrologic factors forcing phytoplankton dynamics. In addition, a change in the ecosystem dynamics regarding Karlodinium is detected. The configuration and the accuracy achieved with the models allow their use in different real-world applications as automated systems and/or monitoring programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use tree-ring isotope chronologies (delta C-13 and delta O-18) from live and dead trees from four locations in south-central Alaska, USA, to test whether white spruce trees killed by recent spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) outbreaks showed evidence of drought stress prior to death. Trees that were killed were more sensitive to spring/summer temperature and/or precipitation than trees that survived. At two of our sites, we found greater correlations between the delta C-13 and delta O-18 chronologies and spring/summer temperatures in dead trees than in live trees, suggesting that trees that are more sensitive to temperature-induced drought stress are more likely to be killed. At one site, the difference between delta C-13 in live and dead trees was related to winter/spring precipitation, with dead trees showing stronger correlations between delta C-13 and precipitation, again suggesting increased water stress in dead trees. At all sites where delta O-18 was measured, delta O-18 chronologies showed the greatest difference in climate response between live and dead groups, with delta O-18 in live trees correlating more strongly with late winter precipitation than dead trees.

However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models. Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale modeling. Here we define and synthesize the ""Appropriate Complexity Method"" (ACME), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the development of process oriented models across a spectrum of scientific and management objectives. ACME helps modelers efficiently converge upon an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable) to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability, tractability, and generality as functions of computational and representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model objectives, provide further guidance for determining the ""appropriate"" level of complexity for representation of processes in models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.

Comparisons of limnological parameters of the two phases revealed not only a distinct seasonal extension of N-limitation but also higher water temperatures that rose earlier and lasted longer between spring and autumn from 1997 to 2012. These differences were reflected by threshold conditions and sensitivity functions of the cyanobacteria-specific models evolved by HEA for the two phases. Seven-day-ahead forecasts matched well timings of peaking biomass observed for the three cyanobacteria but partially failed to predict accurate magnitudes, whereby coefficients of determination r (2) ranged between 0.48 and 0.76 for models in Phase I and between 0.42 and 0.69 in Phase II. The threshold conditions of the models quantified ranges of key predictor variables such as water temperature and transparency, concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P that were symptomatic for sudden outbreaks of high biomass of the three cyanobacteria.

Climate change alone is frequently considered, but in freshwater ecosystems, hydrology is a key driver of the ecology of aquatic species. At large scale, hydrology is however rarely accounted for, owing to the lack of detailed stream flow data. In this study, we developed an integrated modelling approach to simulate stream flow using the hydrological Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Simulated stream flow was subsequently included as an input variable in SDMs along with topographic, hydrographic, climatic and land-cover descriptors. SDMs were applied to two temporally-distinct surveys of the distribution of the endangered Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) in the French Pyrenees: a historical one conducted from 1985 to 1992 and a current one carried out between 2011 and 2013. The model calibrated on historical data was also forecasted onto the current period to assess its ability to describe the distributional change of the Pyrenean desman that has been modelled in the recent years. First, we found that hydrological and climatic variables were the ones influencing the most the distribution of this species for both periods, emphasizing the importance of taking into account hydrology when SDMs are applied to aquatic species. Secondly, our results highlighted a strong range contraction of the Pyrenean desman in the French Pyrenees over the last 25 years. Given that this range contraction was under-estimated when the historical model was forecasted onto current conditions, this finding suggests that other drivers may be interacting with climate, hydrology and land-use changes. Our results imply major concerns for the conservation of this endemic semi-aquatic mammal since changes in climate and hydrology are expected to become more intense in the future.",,,,"PEREZ, Jose Miguel SANCHEZ/O-7198-2014; sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015; Anthony, Maire/P-6576-2014","PEREZ, Jose Miguel SANCHEZ/0000-0002-5650-4879; sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Anthony, Maire/0000-0003-0920-773X; Buisson, Laetitia/0000-0001-6917-0348",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,28-Jul,2016,11,7,,,,,,,e0159941,10.1371/journal.pone.0159941,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000381516100076,,,,,

However, salinity is difficult to estimate in coastal and estuarine waters at the temporal and spatial resolution required. Retrieving sea surface salinity (SSS) using satellite ocean color radiometry may provide estimates with reasonable accuracy and resolution for coastal waters that could be assimilated into hydrodynamic models to improve SSS forecasts. We evaluated the applicability of satellite SSS retrievals from two algorithms for potential assimilation into National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS) hydrodynamic model. Of the two satellite algorithms, a generalized additive model (GAM) outperformed that of an artificial neural network (ANN), with mean bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.27 and 3.71 for the GAM and 3.44 and 5.01 for the ANN. However, the RMSE for the SSS predicted by CBOFS (2.47) was lower than that of both satellite algorithms. Given the better precision of the CBOFS model, assimilation of satellite ocean color SSS retrievals will not improve CBOFS forecasts of SSS in Chesapeake Bay. The bias in the GAM SSS retrievals suggests that adding a variable related to precipitation may improve its performance. (C) The Authors.

Although bark beetles are indigenous to North American forests, climate change has facilitated the beetle's expansion into previously unsuitable habitats. We used three correlative niche models (maximum entropy [MaxEnt], boosted regression trees, and generalized linear models) to estimate (1) the current potential distribution of the beetle in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, (2) how this distribution has changed since historical outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, and (3) how the distribution may be expected to change under future climate scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the temporal transferability of the niche models by forecasting historical models and testing the model predictions using temporally independent outbreak data from the current outbreak. Our results indicated that there has been a significant expansion of climatically suitable habitat over the past 50 yr and that much of this expansion corresponds with an upward shift in elevation across the study area. Furthermore, our models indicated that drought was a more prominent driver of current outbreak than temperature, which suggests a change in the climatic signature between historical and current outbreaks. Projections under future conditions suggest that there will be a large reduction in climatically suitable habitat for the beetle and that high-elevation forests will continue to become more susceptible to outbreak. While all three models generated reasonable predictions, the generalized linear model correctly predicted a higher percentage of current outbreak localities when trained on historical data. Our findings suggest that researchers aiming to reduce omission error in estimates of future species responses may have greater predictive success with simpler, generalized models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUL,2016,7,7,,,,,,,e01396,10.1002/ecs2.1396,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000380020500009,,,,,

This study aimed to conduct a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of the development, current hotspots, and future directions of Lake Taihu research using a bibliometric analysis of eight well-studied lakes (Lake Taihu, Lake Baikal, Lake Biwa, Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, Lake Superior and Lake Victoria) around the world based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) database.

Western Lake Erie is a large (3000 km(2)), shallow (8 m mean depth), freshwater system. CHABs occur from July to October, when stratification is intermittent in response to wind and surface heating or cooling (polymictic). Existing forecast models give the present location and extent of CHABs from satellite imagery, then predict two-dimensional (surface) CHAB movement in response to meteorology. In this study, we simulated vertical distribution of buoyant Microcystis colonies, and 3-D advection, using a Lagrangian particle model forced by currents and turbulent diffusivity from the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). We estimated the frequency distribution of Microcystis colony buoyant velocity from measured size distributions and buoyant velocities. We evaluated several random-walk numerical schemes to efficiently minimize particle accumulation artifacts. We selected the Milstein scheme, with linear interpolation of the diffusivity profile in place of cubic splines, and varied the time step at each particle and step based on the curvature of the local diffusivity profile to ensure that the Visser time step criterion was satisfied. Inclusion of vertical mixing with buoyancy significantly improved model skill statistics compared to an advection-only model, and showed greater skill than a persistence forecast through simulation day 6, in a series of 26 hindcast simulations from 2011.

Here, we developed a method for wheat yield forecasting based on integrating a wheat growth model (WheatGrow) with a radiative transfer model (PROSAIL). Based on the assimilation algorithm, the PROSAIL model was joined to the coupling model, integrating the remote sensing (RS) and growth models. Wheat VIs (vegetation indices) from different growth periods, which were obtained by fusing high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution images, were used for coupling parameters. Moreover, a LUT (look-up table) was developed between VIs and the measured management parameters (sowing date, sowing rate and nitrogen rate) based on the coupling model. Management parameters including sowing date, sowing rate and nitrogen rate, which are difficult to accurately obtain, were then inverted at the regional scale. Reducing the uncertainty from the input parameters of the WheatGrow model, such as management parameters, improved the accuracy of regional-scale yield prediction. We also used measured data from different years and different ecological sites to determine the optimum coupling VI and coupling frequency based on the integration of RS and crop models. The results show that (1) the three-band VI R-Nir/(R-Red + R-Green) and the two-band VI SAVI (R-Nir,R-Red) are the best coupling VIs; (2) the heading or anthesis stage is the best coupling stage if only one RS image is available; (3) good prediction accuracy can be achieved if three to four high spatial and temporal resolution images from the late jointing to initial filling stages are assimilated. In the study areas, the spatial and temporal distribution of winter wheat growth and productivity parameters were well simulated. The RRMSE of leaf area index and leaf nitrogen accumulation between predicted and measured values were 17.8% and 20.3%, respectively, and the RRMSE of grain yield were less than 10%. The results of this study provide an important theoretical and technical foundation for monitoring and estimating winter wheat growth status on a regional scale and can be extended to other types of crops from varied ecological regions.

Traditional approaches focus on fitting data precisely but less consider such a hidden variable, which would experience formidable barriers when encountering fluctuations in time-serial data. In this study, to address the forecasting problem with a hidden state variable and the problem of early-warning-of-risk, we build a novel integrated framework which is consist of three parts: 1) a forecasting model based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an improved Continuous Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) with adaptive exponential weighting (AEW), where the AEW-CHMM is proposed to forecast both the single-step-ahead concentration for general points and fluctuating points, and the three-step-ahead concentration existing immediately after the fluctuating point; 2) Bayesian hierarchical modeling for a ratio estimation; and 3) revised guidelines for the risk-level grading. The case study tests a real dataset of one shallow lake with the proposed approaches and other supervised machine learning methods. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective to offer an intelligent decision support tool for MC forecasting and early warning of risk by risk-level grading.

In an era of rapidly changing climate, the relationship between the timing of those events and environmental cues such as temperature, snowmelt, water availability, or day length are of particular interest. This article provides an overview of the observer-based plant phenology sampling conducted by the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the resulting data, and the rationale behind the design. Trained technicians will conduct regular in situ observations of plant phenology at all terrestrial NEON sites for the 30-yr life of the observatory. Standardized and coordinated data across the network of sites can be used to quantify the direction and magnitude of the relationships between phenology and environmental forcings, as well as the degree to which these relationships vary among sites, among species, among phenophases, and through time. Vegetation at NEON sites will also be monitored with tower-based cameras, satellite remote sensing, and annual high-resolution airborne remote sensing. Ground-based measurements can be used to calibrate and improve satellite-derived phenometrics. NEON's phenology monitoring design is complementary to existing phenology research efforts and citizen science initiatives throughout the world and will produce interoperable data. By collocating plant phenology observations with a suite of additional meteorological, biophysical, and ecological measurements (e.g., climate, carbon flux, plant productivity, population dynamics of consumers) at 47 terrestrial sites, the NEON design will enable continental-scale inference about the status, trends, causes, and ecological consequences of phenological change.",,,,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012; Miller-Rushing, Abraham/D-5102-2009; Moore, David JP/A-6268-2013; Diez, Jeffrey/AAD-5956-2019","Miller-Rushing, Abraham/0000-0003-3203-0143; Moore, David JP/0000-0002-6462-3288; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,APR,2016,7,4,,,,,,,e01303,10.1002/ecs2.1303,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000377213400010,,,,,

Recent research advances have improved estimates of probability and associated uncertainty. Improvements have come from species-specific trait-based risk assessments (of estimates of introduction, establishment, spread, and impact probabilities, especially from pathways of commerce in living organisms), spatially explicit dispersal models (introduction and spread, especially from transportation pathways), and species distribution models (establishment, spread, and impact). Results of these forecasting models combined with improved and cheaper surveillance technologies and practices [e.g., environmentalDNA( eDNA), drones, citizen science] enable more efficient management by focusing surveillance, prevention, eradication, and control efforts on the highest-risk species and locations.

The use of environmental information to improve our ability to predict recruitment, could contribute considerably to fisheries management. However, the problem remains difficult because the mechanisms behind such complex relationships are often poorly understood; this in turn, makes it difficult to determine the forecast estimation robustness, leading to the failure of some relationships when new data become available. The utility of machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) for solving complex problems has been demonstrated in aquatic studies and has led many researchers to advocate ANNs as an attractive, non-linear alternative to traditional statistical methods. The goal of this study is to design a Baltic cod recruitment model (FishANN) that can account for complex ecosystem interactions. To this end, we (1) build a quantitative model representation of the conceptual understanding of the complex ecosystem interactions driving Baltic cod recruitment dynamics, and (2) apply the model to strengthen the current capability to project future changes in Baltic cod recruitment. FishANN is demonstrated to bring multiple stressors together into one model framework and estimate the relative importance of these stressors while interpreting the complex non-linear interactions between them.

To quantify the potential effects of AC on the food web in Lake Erie, we developed an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) food web model and simulated four AC diet composition scenarios (high, low, and no detritus and low detritus with Walleye Sander vitreus and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens larvae) and two nutrient load scenarios (the 1999 baseline load and 2X the baseline [HP]). We quantified the uncertainty of the potential AC effects by coupling the EwE model with estimates of parameter uncertainty in AC production, consumption, and predator diets obtained using structured expert judgment. Our model projected mean +/- SD AC equilibrium biomass ranging from 52 +/- 34 to 104 +/- 75 kg/ha under the different scenarios. Relative to baseline simulations without AC, AC invasion under all detrital diet scenarios decreased the biomass of most fish and zooplankton groups. The effects of AC in the HP scenario were similar to those in the detrital diet scenarios except that the biomasses of most Walleye and Yellow Perch groups were greater under HP because these fishes were buffered from competition with AC by increased productivity at lower trophic levels. Asian carp predation on Walleye and Yellow Perch larvae caused biomass declines among all Walleye and Yellow Perch groups. Large food web impacts of AC occurred in only 2% of the simulations, where AC biomass exceeded 200 kg/ha, resulting in biomass declines of zooplankton and planktivorous fish near the levels observed in the Illinois River. Our findings suggest that AC would affect Lake Erie's food web by competing with other planktivorous fishes and by providing additional prey for piscivores.

The key determinant that is required for estimating irrigation demand in advance is toward the evapotranspiration forecast. Normally, in rich data environment, current reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is estimated by the well-known FAO56 PM method which requires bunch of observed climatic data. In poor data environment for either current or future estimation, this well-known method application is restricted. Indeed, the correctness of ETo forecast remains a challenging computational task, since inaccurate weather variables can alter the forecast accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to employ artificial neural network (ANN) methodology for forecasting near future ETo values by using restricted climate information messages retrieved from public weather forecast source. Four ANNs learning algorithms including the Generalized Feedforward (GFF), Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) are applied with three sets of inputs combination composed of minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) daily air temperatures, extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) and net solar radiation (Rs) to forecast ETo in Dallas. The coefficient of correlation (CC), mean square error (MSE), normalized mean square error (NMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error skill score (MSESS) were used for the models evaluation. Statistically, in comparison with FA056 PM, the performances of ANNs models using only Tmax and Tmin predictors were inferior to those of Tmax, Tmin and Ra. With Tmax, Tmin and Rs input-sets, MLP yielded the highest accuracies (CC= 0.926; MSE= 0.770 mm/day, NMSE= 0.143 mm/day; MAE= 0.708 mm/day). Tmax is an important ETo forecast predictor, and the performance improvement relies mostly on Rs accuracy. With precise weather forecast information, ANN made ETo forecast possible (Average CC= 0.860, MSESS = 0.738). These results can assist irrigation districts to accommodate in advance their crop water demand to near-future irrigation requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier ay.

Culling or regulated harvest is often used to control overabundant species. These methods are difficult to implement in national parks, other types of conservation reserves, or in residential areas where public hunting may be forbidden by policy. As a result, fertility control has been recommended as a non-lethal alternative for regulating ungulate populations. We evaluate this alternative using white-tailed deer in national parks in the vicinity of Washington, D.C., USA as a model system. Managers seek to reduce densities of white-tailed deer from the current average (50 deer per km(2)) to decrease harm to native plant communities caused by deer. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model using 13 years of population estimates from 8 national parks in the National Capital Region Network. We offer a novel way to evaluate management actions relative to goals using short term forecasts.

Although progress has been made in modeling oxygen dynamics and short-term predictions, there is still a lack of long-term forecasts that incorporate multiple inputs including climatological effects such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In this study, we first develop a hypoxic volume index (HV1) using 26-years of hypoxic volume (<62.5 mu m gl(-1)) measurements from the main-stem of the Chesapeake Bay. Then a cross-wavelet analysis is used to identify and weight input parameters in order to build a neural network model of future hypoxic volume. The time-forward dynamic model uses cross-bay winds along with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), and Susquehanna River flow indexes to predict a hypoxic volume index over the next several years. Wavelet analysis indicates an anti-phase relationship between southwesterly winds and hypoxic volume index, and an 18-month phase lag between Susquehanna River index and hypoxic volume index. The neural network model results yield R-values of 0.99, and 0.91 for training, and validation and an R-2 of 0.68 for predictions illustrating the usefulness and promise of these types of models for long-term predictions of hypoxic volume. Model results could be used as a climatologically based hypoxic volume baseline for comparing actual hypoxic volume response to nutrient load reductions.

The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 degrees C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.",,,,"Bjorkman, Anne/H-2211-2016","Bjorkman, Anne/0000-0003-2174-7800; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

These changes have substantial ecological and economic impacts. However, autumn phenology remains surprisingly little studied. Although the effects of unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., frost, heat, wetness, and drought) on autumn phenology have been observed for over 60 y, how these factors interact to influence autumn phenological events remain poorly understood. Using remotely sensed phenology data from 2001 to 2012, this study identified and quantified significant effects of a suite of environmental factors on the timing of fall dormancy of deciduous forest communities in New England, United States. Cold, frost, and wet conditions, and high heat-stress tended to induce earlier dormancy of deciduous forests, whereas moderate heat- and drought-stress delayed dormancy. Deciduous forests in two eco-regions showed contrasting, nonlinear responses to variation in these explanatory factors. Based on future climate projection over two periods (2041-2050 and 2090-2099), later dormancy dates were predicted in northern areas. However, in coastal areas earlier dormancy dates were predicted. Our models suggest that besides warming in climate change, changes in frost and moisture conditions as well as extreme weather events (e.g., drought- and heat-stress, and flooding), should also be considered in future predictions of autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forests. This study improves our understanding of how multiple environmental variables interact to affect autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems, and points the way to building more mechanistic and predictive models.",,,,"Xie, Yingying/H-7124-2019","Xie, Yingying/0000-0002-7759-6178",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

In this study, the ability of coupled discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with artificial neural network (ANN) and multi linear regression (MLR) (WANN and WMLR), ANN, MLR and genetic algorithm-support vector regression (GA-SVR) models for chlorophyll-a level forecasting applications were considered. The data used to develop and validate the models were monthly chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data recorded from January 1994 to December 2013 were obtained from the NO.36 station located in the South San Francisco bay, USA. In the proposed WANN and WMLR models, the observed time series of Chl-a were decomposed to sub time series at different scales by DWT. Afterwards, the sub time series were used as input data to the ANN and MLR systems to predict the 1 month ahead Chl-a. Also the genetic algorithm was linked to SVR models to search for the optimal SVR parameters. The relative performance of the proposed models was compared together and the results showed that the WANN models were found to provide more accurate monthly Chl-a forecasts compared to the other models. The determination coefficient was 0.87, -0.04, 0.31, -2.36 and 0.24 for the WANN, WMLR, ANN, MLR and GA-SVR models, respectively. In addition, the WANN model predicted extreme Chl-a values precisely. The results indicate that the WANN models are a promising new method for eutrophication level forecasting in bays such as those found in South San Francisco Bay. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of algal abnormal proliferation using as a predictor the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of previous days. For this purpose, some biological parameters (phytoplankton species expressed in biovolume) in addition to the most important chemical and physical-chemical parameters were considered. The implementation of the statistical learning method known as support vector machines (SVMs) allowed us to predict the Chl a concentration, one of the most frequently used estimators of algal biomass, and to study its evolution in the Trasona reservoir (Principality of Asturias, Northern Spain). In the first place, the main goal was to obtain the dependence relationship of chlorophyll concentration as a function of not only several chemical and physical-chemical variables but also the biological ones. This dependence relationship was useful in setting the significance order of the variables involved in the Chl a prediction. Secondly, a model for forecasting the algal abnormal proliferation is obtained. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter.

Daily meteorological data were collected to train and validate the ANNs against the Penman-Monteith (PM) model. And then, the temperature forecasts for 7-day ahead were entered into the validated ANNs to produce ETo forecast outputs. The forecasting performances of models were evaluated through comparisons between the ETo forecasted by ANNs and ETo calculated by PM from the observed meteorological data. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.91, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within +/- 2 A degrees C) ranged from 68.34 to 91.61 %, whereas for the maximum temperature it ranged from 51.78 to 57.44 %.

Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons.

The commonly available prediction models are physically based numerical approach or data-driven approach. However, these models are sometimes restricted by the lack of an explicit representation function or by insufficient data. The present research aimed to develop forecasting models that provide early warning on cyanobacteria outbreaks, as well as understand the ecological thresholds and relationships that determine such events, by means of evolutionary computation. The Lake Taihu, which has been suffering from severe cyanobacteria blooms over the last decades due to eutrophication, was taken as study case. Two modelling approaches were used based on water quality data collected from 31 monitoring sites from 2008 to 2012. First, eight sampling sites representing spatially different environmental conditions across Lake Taihu were selected to develop 2-day ahead forecasting models. The resulting models well-matched the timing and magnitude of the observed cyanobacteria dynamics for all eight sites, which was reflected by coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.62 for eastern site 24 being least favourable to cyanobacteria growth and 0.83 for north-western site 6 being most favourable. The sensitivity analyses revealed inhibitory relationships with nitrate at water temperatures greater than 18 degrees C and excitatory relationships with phosphate at lower water temperatures for most sites, which suggested N-limitation of the lake existed locally in summer and autumn. Second, the aggregated data from all 31 sites were used to develop a generic 2-day ahead forecasting model. When compared with the observed cyanobacteria data of the eight selected sampling sites, the generic model achieved slightly lower coefficients of determination than the site-specific models, with the lowest r(2) value for site 24 (0.36) and the highest r(2) value for site 6 (0.77). The sensitivity analysis for the generic model revealed a much lower water temperature threshold of 13.01 degrees C, above which N-limitation for cyanobacteria growth was indicated. Overall, both the spatially-explicit models and the generic model were suitable for early warning of cyanobacteria blooms at most sampling sites, and specified understanding on the environmental conditions that favour cyanobacteria growth across Lake Taihu.

A significant correlation between fAPAR and official yields (R-2 > 0.6) was found in water-limited yield agro-climatic conditions (e.g. the Black Sea region and the Mediterranean basin) for all three crops studied. In regions where crops experience frequent water stress, most of the yield inter-annual variability is explained by substantial changes in leaf area from one year to another, and can be well captured by regional fAPAR time-series. By contrast, in regions characterized by high yields (e.g. northern Europe) - where water constraints are generally not frequent and, therefore, fAPAR inter-annual variability is low - the correlation between fAPAR and yield is weaker (R-2 < 0.5) as yield variations tend to be explained by multiple factors other than green leaf area. These results confirm the reliability of EO time-series for operational crop yield forecasting at regional level, but also suggest that additional meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration) need to be taken into account to interpret EO products meaningfully. Moreover, specific issues related to the spatial resolution of the EO-products, and the absence of dynamic crop masks, currently impede access to crop-specific time-series in the fragmented agricultural landscapes of Europe, and restrict the use of 1-km biophysical products to major crops.

Areal emission factor was determined from gridded areal fraction of oak trees, which was produced by the analysis of the tree type maps (1: 5000) obtained from the Korea Forest Service.

For the verification of the model, daily observed pollen concentration from 12 sites in Korea during the pollen season of 2014. Although the model showed a tendency of over-estimation in terms of the seasonal and daily mean concentrations, overall concentration was similar to the observation.

These blooms pose potential health risks for recreation, and impact the treatment of drinking water. Understanding the timing and distribution of the blooms may aid in planning by local communities and resources managers. Satellite data provides a means of examining spatial patterns of the blooms. Data sets from MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS (2012-2014) were analyzed to evaluate bloom patterns and frequencies. The blooms were identified using previously published algorithms to detect cyanobacteria (~25,000 cells mL(-1)), as well as a variation of these algorithms to account for the saturation of the MODIS ocean color bands. Images were binned into 10-day composites to reduce cloud and mixing artifacts. The 13 years of composites were used to determine frequency of presence of both detectable cyanobacteria and high risk (>100,000 cells mL(-1)) blooms. The bloom season according to the satellite observations falls within June 1 and October 31. Maps show the pattern of development and areas most commonly impacted during all years (with minor and severe blooms). Frequencies during years with just severe blooms (minor bloom years were not included in the analysis) were examined in the same fashion.

Nevertheless, little is known about long-term variation in salmon migration timing for multiple species across broad regions. We used long-term data for five Pacific salmon species throughout rapidly warming southeast Alaska to describe long-term changes in salmon migration timing, interannual phenological synchrony, relationships between climatic variation and migratory timing, and to test whether long-term changes in migration timing are related to glaciation in headwater streams. Temporal changes in the median date of salmon migration timing varied widely across species. Most sockeye populations are migrating later over time (11 of 14), but pink, chum, and especially coho populations are migrating earlier than they did historically (16 of 19 combined). Temporal trends in duration and interannual variation in migration timing were highly variable across species and populations. The greatest temporal shifts in the median date of migration timing were correlated with decreases in the duration of migration timing, suggestive of a loss of phenotypic variation due to natural selection. Pairwise interannual correlations in migration timing varied widely but were generally positive, providing evidence for weak region-wide phenological synchrony. This synchrony is likely a function of climatic variation, as interannual variation in migration timing was related to climatic phenomenon operating at large- (Pacific decadal oscillation), moderate- (sea surface temperature), and local-scales (precipitation). Surprisingly, the presence or the absence of glaciers within a watershed was unrelated to long-term shifts in phenology. Overall, there was extensive heterogeneity in long-term patterns of migration timing throughout this climatically and geographically complex region, highlighting that future climatic change will likely have widely divergent impacts on salmon migration timing. Although salmon phenological diversity will complicate future predictions of migration timing, this variation likely acts as a major contributor to population and ecosystem resiliency in southeast Alaska.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Despite considerable efforts to divert effluents from the watershed, the cyanobacterial blooms still reoccur and persist throughout summer. To mitigate cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, a large scale integrated monitoring and forecasting system was developed, and a series of emergency response measures were instigated based on early warning. This system has been in place for 2009-2012. With this integrated monitoring system, it was found that the detectable maximum and average cyanobacterial bloom area were similar to that-before drinking water crisis, indicating that poor eutrophic status and cyanobacterial bloom had persisted without significant alleviation. It also revealed that cyanobacterial bloom would occur after the intense storm, which may be associated with the increase in buoyance of cyanobacterial colonies. Although the cyanobacterial blooms had persisted during the monitoring period, there had been a reduction in frequency and intensity of the cyanobacterial bloom induced black water agglomerates (a phenomenon of algal bloom death decay to release a large amount black dissolved organic matter), and there have been no further drinking water crises. This monitoring and response strategy can reduce the cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, but cannot reduce eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms, problems which will take decades to resolve.

Temperature sensitivity was found to differ greatly among vegetation from different environmental conditions. Understanding the large-scale spatial pattern of temperature sensitivity and its underlying determinant will greatly improve our ability to predict spring phenology. In this study, we investigated the temperature sensitivity for natural ecosystems over the North Hemisphere (north of 30 degrees N), based on the vegetation phenological date estimated from NDVI time-series data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the corresponding climate dataset. We found a notable longitudinal change pattern with considerable increases of temperature sensitivity from inlands to most coastal areas and a less obvious latitudinal pattern with larger sensitivity in low latitude area. This general spatial variation in temperature sensitivity is most strongly associated with the within-spring warming speed (WWS; r = 0.35, p < 0.01), a variable describing the increase speed of daily mean temperature during spring within a year, compared with other factors including the mean spring temperature, spring precipitation and mean winter temperature. These findings suggest that the same magnitude of warming will less affect spring vegetation phenology in regions with higher WWS, which might partially reflect plants' adaption to local climate that prevents plants from frost risk caused by the advance of spring phenology. WWS accounts for the spatial variation in temperature sensitivity and should be taken into account in forecasting spring phenology and in assessing carbon cycle under the projected climate warming.

The data assimilation method which combined crop growth model and multi-source observed data has been proven to be the most effective method to simulate the crop growth process and predict crop yields. Based on the observed LAI, the time-series LAI data sets were obtained by using the smooth unequally spaced interpolation. With the support of amount of related data, the crop model of Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)Wheat can be used to simulate the growth of the winter wheat, and the particle filtering-based data assimilation strategy also could be implemented to improve the CERES-Wheat simulation process. Through the assimilation strategy, the incorporation between the observed and modeled LAIs was performed under the dynamic framework of the winter wheat growth process such that the LAI simulation was sequentially optimized, which led to optimal yield estimation. Comparing the measured the data with the assimilation and no assimilation results, it obvious showed that the yield estimations were dramatically improved after assimilation. Then considering the influence of the observed leaf area index on the assimilation process at multi-temporal scale, this paper try to analysis the uncertainty of the assimilation results from three aspects of temporal scale: First, Assimilating the observed LAI data at five kinds of temporal resolution (2day, 4-day, 8-day, 16-day, 32-day), the results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation tended to significantly improve as the temporal resolution of assimilating LAI increased from 32day to 2-day. In addition, as the increasing of the temporal resolution, the computing time increased dramatically. Second, the observed LAI data was applied to assimilation with the four different stages of crop growth (green-jointing, jointing-heading, heading-mature, green-mature). The results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation by assimilating the LAI at the stages of the green-mature (the whole growth phase) is the highest, while the accuracy during the stages from the greenjointing is the lowest. And also the accuracy during the stages from jointing-heading is the second highest. Third, the observed LAI data was used to assimilation with synthesizing the temporal resolution and the stages of crop growth (three kinds of temporal resolution (2, 4, 8 day) and four stages of crop growth). The results showed that on the premise of the optimal efficiency and accuracy, the optimal plan is to select observed LAI by using the temporal resolution of 8 day during the stages from jointingheading. This study will be a better influence on decreasing the calculation time and improving the effect for the crop model data assimilation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT CONF AGRO-GEOINF,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",,,WOS:000380400300080,,,,,

Robust forecasts of landings can also provide a projected baseline for evaluation of proposed management alternatives. We compared generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models in terms of fit, accuracy, and ability to forecast landings of four representative fish stocks that support recreational fisheries in the southeastern United States. All models were useful in developing reliable forecasts to inform management. The GAMs provided the best fit to the observed data; however, the modeling approaches of the SARIMA model and GLM provided the best forecasts for most scenarios. The SARIMA model and GLM also provided the best predictions of the seasonal trend in landings, a desirable feature for in-season quota monitoring. The SARIMA model was more sensitive and the GLM was less sensitive to recent trends, providing a useful ""bookend"" for forecasts. The time span of input data affected forecast accuracy from all model types considered.

We show that the solution of a stochastic advection-diffusion partial differential equation provides a flexible model class for spatiotemporal processes which is computationally feasible also for large data sets. The Gaussian process defined through the stochastic partial differential equation has, in general, a non-separable covariance structure. Its parameters can be physically interpreted as explicitly modelling phenomena such as transport and diffusion that occur in many natural processes in diverse fields ranging from environmental sciences to ecology. To obtain computationally efficient statistical algorithms, we use spectral methods to solve the stochastic partial differential equation. This has the advantage that approximation errors do not accumulate over time, and that in the spectral space the computational cost grows linearly with the dimension, the total computational cost of Bayesian or frequentist inference being dominated by the fast Fourier transform. The model proposed is applied to post-processing of precipitation forecasts from a numerical weather prediction model for northern Switzerland. In contrast with the raw forecasts from the numerical model, the post-processed forecasts are calibrated and quantify prediction uncertainty. Moreover, they outperform the raw forecasts, in the sense that they have a lower mean absolute error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J R STAT SOC B,J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B-Stat.

In this study, recently proposed supervised classification techniques, tested by the machine-learning community, are applied to forecast the recruitment of seven fish species of North East Atlantic (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, horse mackerel, hake, blue whiting and albacore), using spawning, environmental and climatic data. In addition, the use of the probabilistic flexible naive Bayes classifier (FNBC) is proposed as modelling approach in order to reduce uncertainty for fisheries management purposes. Those improvements aim is to improve probability estimations of each possible outcome (low, medium and high recruitment) based in kernel density estimation, which is crucial for informed management decision making with high uncertainty. Finally, a comparison between goodness-of-fit and generalization power is provided, in order to assess the reliability of the final forecasting models.

While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections.

Objective: To analyze the long-term Ambrosia pollen counts and develop a forecasting model to predict the next day's pollen concentration. Methods: Airborne pollen has been collected since December 1986 with a Burkard spore trap at the University of Tulsa. Summary statistics and season metrics were calculated for the 27 years of data. Concentration and previous-day meteorologic data from 1987 to 2011 were used to develop a multiple regression model to predict pollen levels for the following day. Model output was compared to 2012 and 2013 ragweed pollen data. Results: The Tulsa ragweed season extends from the middle of August to late October. The mean start date is August 22, the mean peak date is September 10, and the mean end date is October 20. The mean cumulative season total is 11,599 pollen/m(3), and the mean daily concentration is 197 pollen/m(3). Previous-day meteorologic and phenologic data were positively related to pollen concentration (P < .001). Precipitation was modeled as a dichotomous variable. The final model included minimum temperature, dichotomous precipitation, dew point, and phenology variable (R = 0.7146, P < .001). Analysis of the model's accuracy revealed that the model was highly representative of the 2012 and 2013 seasons (R = 0.680, P < .001). Conclusion: Multiple regression models may be useful in explaining the variability of Ambrosia pollen levels. Further testing of the modeling parameters in different geographical areas is needed.

It has been hypothesized that trees with diffuse-porous xylem anatomy and early successional species may respond most to warming. Within species, northern populations may respond most due to the fact that growing seasons are relatively short. Species most sensitive to spring temperature may show little overall response to warming if reduced chilling in fall/winter offsets accelerated winter/spring development. Because current thermal models consider only highly aggregated variables, for example degree-days or chilling units (temperature sums for a season or year), they may not accurately represent warming effects. We show that assumptions contained in current thermal (degree-day) models are unrealistic for climate change analysis. Critical threshold parameters are not identifiable, and they do not actually have much to do with thresholds for development. Traditional models further overlook the discrete nature of observations, observation error and the continuous response of phenological development to temperature variation. An alternative continuous development model (CDM) that addresses these problems is applied to a large experimental warming study near northern and southern boundaries of 15 species in the eastern deciduous forest of the USA, in North Carolina and Massachusetts. Results provide a detailed time course of phenological development, including vernalization during winter and warming in spring, and challenge the basic assumptions of thermal models. Where traditional models find little evidence of a chilling effect (most are insignificant or have the wrong sign), the continuous development model finds evidence of chilling effects in most species. Contrary to the hypothesis that northern populations respond most, we find southern populations are most responsive. Because northern populations already have a compressed period for spring development, they may lack flexibility to further advance development. A stronger response in the southern range could allow residents to resist northward migration of immigrants as climate warms. If potential invaders fail to exploit a prolonged growing season to the same degree as residents, then there is a resident advantage. Hypothesized effects of warming for xylem anatomy and successional status are not supported by the 15 species in this study. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",,,,,"Salk, Carl/0000-0003-2833-8292",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, TOA radiance data in the MODIS ocean bands over turbid atmosphere in east China often saturate, leaving only four land bands to use. In this study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been developed and validated to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla, mu g/L) in surface waters of Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China. The EOF approach analyzed the spectral variance of normalized Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) data at 469, 555, 645, and 859 nm, and subsequently related that variance to Chla using 28 concurrent MODIS and field measurements. This empirical algorithm was then validated using another 30 independent concurrent MODIS and field measurements. Image analysis and radiative transfer simulations indicated that the algorithm appeared to be tolerant to aerosol perturbations, with unbiased RMS uncertainties of <80% for Chla ranging between 3 and 100 mu g/L. Application of the algorithm to a total of 853 MODIS images between 2000 and 2013 under cloud-free conditions revealed spatial distribution patterns and seasonal changes that are consistent to previous findings based on floating algae mats. The current study can provide additional quantitative estimates of Chla that can be assimilated in an existing forecast model, which showed improved performance over the use of a previous Chla algorithm. However, the empirical nature, relatively large uncertainties, and limited number of spectral bands all point to the need of further improvement in data availability and accuracy with future satellite sensors.",,,,"Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011","Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,NOV,2014,6,11,,,,,10694,10715,,10.3390/rs61110694,,,,Remote Sensing,,,WOS:000345530700021,,,,,

Methods and ResultsWe evaluated and applied previously published qPCR assays to water samples (n=1636) collected from Chesapeake Bay from 2007-2010 in conjunction with State water quality monitoring programmes. A variety of statistical techniques were used in concert to identify water quality parameters associated with V.vulnificus presence, abundance and virulence markers in the interest of developing strong predictive models for use in regional oceanographic modeling systems. A suite of models are provided to represent the best model fit and alternatives using environmental variables that allow them to be put to immediate use in current ecological forecasting efforts. ConclusionsEnvironmental parameters such as temperature, salinity and turbidity are capable of accurately predicting abundance and distribution of V.vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay.

Although temperature is generally considered most important, other weather events such as frosts and precipitation events can also influence many species' phenology. Non-climatic variables such as photoperiod and site-specific habitat characteristics can also have important effects on phenology. Forecasting phenological shifts due to climate change requires understanding and quantifying how these multiple factors combine to affect phenology. However, current approaches to analyzing phenological data have a limited ability for quantifying multiple drivers simultaneously. Here, we use a novel statistical approach to estimate the combined effects of multiple variables, including local weather events, on the phenology of several taxa (a tree, an insect, and a fungus). We found that thermal forcing had a significant positive effect on each species, frost events delayed the phenology of the tree and butterfly, and precipitation had a positive effect on fungal fruiting. Using data from sites across latitudinal gradients, we found that these effects are remarkably consistent across sites once latitude and other site effects are accounted for. This consistency suggests an underlying biological response to these variables that is not commonly estimated using data from field observations. This approach's flexibility will be useful for forecasting ongoing phenological responses to changes in climate variability in addition to seasonal trends.",,,,"Diez, Jeffrey/AAD-5956-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Simulations of daily mean T were used as input to our stochastic hourly T model. CC effects were on average two orders of magnitude greater than LU impacts on mean daily stream T.

Short-term (on the order of hours) nutrient pulsing resulting from the passage of typhoons played a key role in bloom initiation and maintenance. Decreasing wind speeds and increasing air and water temperatures in the aftermath of cyclones were accompanied by elevated phytoplankton biomass concentrations. The synergistic effects of nutrient pulsing, elevated water temperatures and increased water column stratification after the passage of the cyclones stimulated blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. There were short-term successions of blooms following typhoons, and as blooms ""crashed"" they provided nutrient inocula for future blooms.

Early warning of phytoplankton accumulation can support decision-making against harmful algal bloom events. To investigate the performance of different models in forecasting high phytoplankton biomass, we developed a mechanistic, a regression and three artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict short-term (3 days) changes of phytoplankton biomass (expressed as chlorophyll-a concentration) in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu. We determined the input variables of the ANN models with a sensitivity analysis, and optimized their parameters with a trial-and-error approach. The sensitivity analysis revealed the effects of the input variables on phytoplankton biomass. To calibrate and validate the models, we collected two data sets of Lake Taihu in 2009: hourly-averaged data collected by an automatic monitoring system and field data with a sampling interval of twice a week. Although the sensitivity analysis results vary among the five models, there is a general consensus that phytoplankton changes are significantly affected by water temperature in Gonghu Bay. The ANN models obtained good model fit indicating their practical values in predicting non-linear phytoplankton dynamics for water management purpose.

Automated online sondes have been widely used for in situ real-time monitoring of water quality due to their high reliability and low cost. However, the knowledge of using real-time data from those sondes to forecast phytoplankton blooms has been seldom addressed. Here we present an integrated system for real-time observation, early warning and forecasting of phytoplankton blooms by integrating automated online sondes and the ecological model. Specifically, based on the high-frequency data from automated online sondes in Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir, we successfully developed 1-4 days ahead forecasting models for chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration with hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEM). With the predicted concentration of chl a, we achieved a high precision in 1-7 days ahead early warning of good (chl a < 25 mu g/L) and eutrophic (chl a 8-25 mu g/L) conditions; however only achieved an acceptable precision in 1-2 days ahead early warning of hypertrophic condition (chl a >= 25 mu g/L). Our study shows that the optimized HEM achieved an acceptable performance in real-time short-term forecasting and early warning of phytoplankton blooms with the data from the automated in situ sondes. This system provides an efficient way in real-time monitoring and early warning of phytoplankton blooms, and may have a wide application in eutrophication monitoring and management.

We therefore adopted inverted images (from MODIS imagery) to judge whether cyanobacterial blooms had occurred in a water area at a given-time. We constructed two probit models for identifying significant environmental factors related to cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and for short-term forecasts of bloom occurrence. The models used the index of cyanobacterial bloom occurrence as the dependent variable and the predicted variable, respectively, and used three categories (water quality, hydrology, and weather) of monitoring variables as the independent variables (or predictive variables). We used the Hill Dagong water area of Lake Tai in China as a case study of the new methods. The results produced by the identification model are consistent with the general conclusions in this research field indicating the validity of the model. The mean relative error of the forecast model is 13.5%, which is close to or lower than that of two previous models. Compared with the previous models, our forecast model also has advantages in terms of spatial and temporal precision. The new models have both practical applicability and the ability to be generalized and can, therefore, be easily adapted for the prevention, control, and prediction of cyanobacterial blooms in other bodies of water.

This study provides a framework to accomplish this task in salmon-bearing streams of the northwestern United States, where land-use-related reductions in riparian shading have caused changes in stream thermal regimes, and additional warming from projected climate change may result in significant losses of coldwater fish habitat over the next century. Predatory, nonnative smallmouth bass have also been introduced into many northwestern streams, and their range is likely to expand as streams warm, presenting an additional challenge to the persistence of threatened Pacific salmon. The goal of this work was to forecast the interactive effects of climate change, riparian management, and nonnative species on stream-rearing salmon and to evaluate the capacity of restoration to mitigate these effects. We intersected downscaled global climate forecasts with a local-scale water temperature model to predict mid- and end-of-century temperatures in streams in the Columbia River basin. We compared one stream that is thermally impaired due to the loss of riparian vegetation and another that is cooler and has a largely intact riparian corridor. Using the forecasted stream temperatures in conjunction with fish habitat models, we predicted how stream-rearing chinook salmon and bass distributions would change as each stream warmed. In the highly modified stream, end-of-century warming may cause near total loss of chinook salmon-rearing habitat and a complete invasion of the upper watershed by bass. In the less modified stream, bass were thermally restricted from the upstream-most areas. In both systems, temperature increases resulted in higher predicted spatial overlap between stream-rearing chinook salmon and potentially predatory bass in the early summer (two- to fourfold increase) and greater abundance of bass. We found that riparian restoration could prevent the extirpation of chinook salmon from the more altered stream and could also restrict bass from occupying the upper 31 km of salmon-rearing habitat. The proposed methodology and model predictions are critical for prioritizing climate-change adaptation strategies before salmonids are exposed to both warmer water and greater predation risk by nonnative species.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Prediction relies on models that describe our understanding of the major processes that underlie system dynamics and data about these processes and the present state of ecosystems. Prediction becomes more effective when models are well informed by data. A technological revolution in the capacity to collect data now provides very different opportunities to test hypotheses and project future dynamics than when many standard statistical tests were first developed. Data assimilation is an emerging statistical approach to combine models with data in a rigorous way to constrain model parameters and system states, identify model error, and improve ecological prediction. In this paper, we illustrate how data assimilation can improve ecological prediction to support decision-making by reviewing applications of data assimilation across four different research fields: (1) emerging infectious disease, (2) fisheries, (3) fire, and (4) the terrestrial carbon cycle. Across these fields, data assimilation substantially improves prediction accuracy, highlighting its important role in enabling predictive ecology. Data assimilation with regional and global models faces major challenges, such as the large number of parameters to be estimated, high computational demands, the need to integrate multiple and heterogeneous data sets, and complex social-ecological interactions. Nevertheless, data assimilation provides an important statistical approach that has great potential to enhance the predictive capacity of ecological models in a changing climate.",,,,"Keenan, Trevor F./B-2744-2010; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009","Keenan, Trevor F./0000-0002-3347-0258; Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAY,2014,5,5,,,,,,,65,10.1890/ES13-00273.1,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000337164100016,,,,,

This is reflected in national climate change response plans recently released by major resource agencies. However, managers on-the-ground are often unclear about how to use phenological information to inform their management practices. Until recently, this was at least partially due to the lack of broad-based, standardized phenology data collection across taxa and geographic regions. Such efforts are now underway, albeit in very early stages. Nonetheless, a major hurdle still exists: phenology-linked climate change research has focused more on describing broad ecological changes rather than making direct connections to local to regional management concerns. To help researchers better design relevant research for use in conservation and management decision-making processes, we describe phenology-related research topics that facilitate ""actionable"" science. Examples include research on evolution and phenotypic plasticity related to vulnerability, the demographic consequences of trophic mismatch, the role of invasive species, and building robust ecological forecast models. Such efforts will increase phenology literacy among on-the-ground resource managers and provide information relevant for short- and long-term decision-making, particularly as related to climate response planning and implementing climate-informed monitoring in the context of adaptive management. In sum, we argue that phenological information is a crucial component of the resource management toolbox that facilitates identification and evaluation of strategies that will reduce the vulnerability of natural systems to climate change.

To better detect such shifts, scientists need long-term phenological records covering many taxa and across a broad geographic distribution. To date, phenological observation efforts across the USA have been geographically limited and have used different methods, making comparisons across sites and species difficult. To facilitate coordinated cross-site, cross-species, and geographically extensive phenological monitoring across the nation, the USA National Phenology Network has developed in situ monitoring protocols standardized across taxonomic groups and ecosystem types for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine plant and animal taxa. The protocols include elements that allow enhanced detection and description of phenological responses, including assessment of phenological ""status"", or the ability to track presence-absence of a particular phenophase, as well as standards for documenting the degree to which phenological activity is expressed in terms of intensity or abundance. Data collected by this method can be integrated with historical phenology data sets, enabling the development of databases for spatial and temporal assessment of changes in status and trends of disparate organisms.

Two winter wheat yield estimation procedures were conducted on a field plot and regional scale to test the feasibility and potential of the POD4DVar-based strategy. Winter wheat yield forecasts for the field plots showed a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.73, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 319 kg/ha, and a relative error (RE) of 3.49%.

We proposed a method for short-term forecasting of ET0 using the locally calibrated Hargreaves-Samani model and temperature forecasts. Daily meteorological data from four stations in China for the period 2001-2013 were collected to calibrate and validate the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model against the Penman-Monteith (PM) model, and the temperature forecasts for a 7-day horizon in 2012-2013 were collected and entered into the calibrated HS model to forecast the ET0. The proposed method was tested through comparisons between ET0 forecasts and ET0 calculated from observed meteorological data and the PM model. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.94, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within +/- 2 C) ranged from 60.48% to 76.29% and the accuracy of the maximum temperature forecast ranged from 50.18% to 62.94%.

The sources of errors were the error in the temperature forecasts and the fact that the effects of wind speed and relative humidity were not considered in the HS model. The applications illustrated that the proposed method could provide daily ET0 forecasts with a certain degree of accuracy for real-time irrigation forecasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Over the last 30years, the lake has suffered from serious cyanobacterial blooms that deteriorate drinking water quality and in some cases have led to serious water supply crises. For local government to respond quickly to the onset of a cyanobacterial bloom, it is crucial to forecast the probability, areas, and intensity of the bloom. In this paper, an attempt to forecast the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu is documented. The forecast is based on a short-term cyanobacterial bloom forecasting numerical model containing a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-algal biomass model and a probability of bloom occurrence forecasting model. The former model was based on solving the governing equations of the cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in shallow lakes. Unstructured mesh division was used to fit the irregular coastal boundaries where harmful blooms often happened. The finite volume method discretized the governing equations, and the conservation laws were preserved. To drive the model, the initial algae chlorophyll a concentrations were obtained from 18 automatic monitoring buoys and boat survey measurements. By combining calculation and prediction of the hydrological and meteorologic scenarios over the ensuing 3days, the dynamic distributions of the algae concentration scenarios in Lake Taihu were simulated. Blooming probabilities were then predicted by a forecast model that included the weight of algal biomass, wind velocity, and weather condition. The model was applied to predict the occurrences of the algae blooms of the next 3days in Lake Taihu during April to September in 2009 and 2010. Independent evaluations from remote sensing images and boat survey data showed that the accuracy of these bloom forecasts was more than 80%.

By coherently synthesizing discrete observations with continuous responses to temperature variation, we accurately quantify how increasing temperature variation accelerates onset of growth. Application to warming experiments at two latitudes demonstrates that maximum responses to warming are concentrated in late winter, weeks ahead of the main budbreak period. Given that warming will not occur uniformly over the year, knowledge of when temperature variation has the most impact can guide prediction. Responses are large and heterogeneous, yet predictable.

This study combines coastal bathymetry and elevation models to develop a continuous topographic model covering coastal areas on a large geographical scale, and predicts the areal change in five habitats important to numerous breeding and migrating birds. Our model indicates considerable declines in coastal habitats as a result of coastal squeeze, and reveals major conservation concerns regarding future preservation of essential waterbird habitats. In our study area this will directly influence seven species of herbivorous waterbirds occurring at internationally important numbers, and a total of 41 species of coastal birds protected under the EU Birds Directive, many of which are currently designated as having an unfavourable conservation status. Declines in coastal habitats will also affect invertebrates and fish, and through effects on food webs have an even wider ecological implication. These findings highlight the need of focused coastal management, and illustrate the cost of uncritically protecting human agricultural interests while preventing natural dynamics of the coastal zone. Our analysis indicate that pulling down existing sea walls will reduce the loss by 37-65% dependent on habitat type, but that complete compensation is unlikely in our study area due to local topography. Managed retreat of coastlines might be an efficient solution to counteract the effects of coastal squeeze, but the time and interests associated with implementation of such mitigation measures imply that the time for action is now.

Using the observational data sampled during the growing season in 2007-2011, a Bayesian hurdle Poisson model was developed to predict cyanobacteria abundance in the lake. The model allowed cyanobacteria absence (zero count) and nonzero cyanobacteria counts to be modeled as functions of different environmental factors. The model predictions demonstrated that the principal factor that determines the success of cyanobacteria was temperature. Combined with high temperature, increased residence time indicated by low outflow rates appeared to increase the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence. A stable water column, represented by low suspended solids, and high temperature were the requirements for high abundance of cyanobacteria.

Both the magnitude of temperature increase and the sensitivity of the greenness phenology to temperature-the phenological change per unit temperature-can contribute the advancement. To determine the temperature-sensitivity, we examined the satellite-derived SOS and the potentially effective pre-season temperature (T-eff) from 1982 to 2008 for vegetated land between 30 degrees N and 80 degrees N. Earlier season vegetation types, i.e., the vegetation types with earlier SOSmean (mean SOS for 1982-2008), showed greater advancement of SOS during 1982-2008. The advancing rate of SOS against year was also greater in the vegetation with earlier SOSmean even the T-eff increase was the same. These results suggest that the spring phenology of vegetation may have high temperature sensitivity in a warmer area. Therefore it is important to consider temperature-sensitivity in assessing broad-scale phenological responses to climatic warming.

Data assimilation of remote sensing based on crop growth simulation becomes an effective means of monitoring regional agriculture information, which provides significant advantages in terms of economic cost, effectiveness, precision and suitability on regional scales. Data assimilation based crop growth process models can be defined as the methodology of improving process and precision of simulation which integrates simulated forecast with multi-source observation in the framework of dynamic models. According to mathematic principles of integrating model forecast with observation, three approaches of assimilating remote sensing information into crop models are concluded in this review, such as forcing, calibration and updating. Some critical issues and trends in the operation system of remote sensing data assimilation based on crop models on regional or global scales has been discussed, such as remotely sensed observation, uncertainty in assimilating process, data assimilation schemes.

Capturing the constraint of N on terrestrial C uptake and storage has been a focus of the Earth System Modeling community. However, there is little understanding of the trade-offs and sensitivities of allocating C and N to different tissues in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Here we describe a new, simple model of ecosystem C-N cycling and interactions (ACONITE), that builds on theory related to plant economics in order to predict key ecosystem properties (leaf area index, leaf C: N, N fixation, and plant C use efficiency) based on the outcome of assessments of the marginal change in net C or N uptake associated with a change in allocation of C or N to plant tissues. We simulated and evaluated steady-state ecosystem stocks and fluxes in three different forest ecosystems types (tropical evergreen, temperate deciduous, and temperate evergreen). Leaf C : N differed among the three ecosystem types (temperate deciduous< tropical evergreen< temperature evergreen), a result that compared well to observations from a global database describing plant traits. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) estimates compared well to observed fluxes at the simulation sites. Simulated N fixation at steady-state, calculated based on relative demand for N and the marginal return on C investment to acquire N, was an order of magnitude higher in the tropical forest than in the temperate forest, consistent with observations. A sensitivity analysis revealed that parameterization of the relationship between leaf N and leaf respiration had the largest influence on leaf area index and leaf C : N. A parameter governing how photosynthesis scales with day length had the largest influence on total vegetation C, GPP, and NPP. Multiple parameters associated with photosynthesis, respiration, and N uptake influenced the rate of N fixation. Overall, our ability to constrain leaf area index and allow spatially and temporally variable leaf C : N can help address challenges simulating these properties in ecosystem and Earth System models. Furthermore, the simple approach with emergent properties based on coupled C-N dynamics has potential for use in research that uses data-assimilation methods to integrate data on both the C and N cycles to improve C flux forecasts.",,,,"Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Thomas, R.

In particular, in tide-dominated areas due to higher near-bottom shear stress at strong currents, sediment concentration and turbidity are expected to be at maximum during spring tide, while algal growth rate likely is peaking up at slack currents during neap tide. Varying weather and atmospheric conditions might modulate the said dependencies, but the water quality pattern still is expected to follow the dominant tidal cycle. As tidal cycling could be predicted well ahead, there is a possibility to use water quality and hydrodynamic high-resolution data to learn past dependencies, and then use tidal hydrodynamic model for nowcasting and forecasting of selected water quality parameters. This paper develops data driven models for nowcasting and forecasting turbidity and chlorophyll-a using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with Genetic Algorithm (GA). The use of GA aims to automate and enhance ANN designing process. The training of the ANN model is done by constructing input-output mapping, where hydrodynamic parameters act as an input for the network, while turbidity and chlorophyll-a are the corresponding outputs (desired target). Afterward, the prediction is carried out only by employing computed water surface elevation as an input for the trained ANN model. The proposed data driven model has successfully revealed complex relationships and utilized its experiential knowledge acquired from the training process for facilitating the subsequent use of the data driven model to yield an accurate prediction.

This study analysed the hypothesis that the vitality of spruce vegetation is already susceptible from factors such as climate change or emissions to a certain extent before infestation, so that the role of the subsequent bark beetle infestation is only secondary. Hyperspectral remote-sensing techniques were used to detect changes in biochemical-biophysical vegetation characteristics in the spruce forest of the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. For this study, several spectral bands, vegetation indices and specific spectral band combinations of hyperspectral HyMAP remote-sensing data with a 4 m and a 7 m ground resolution were analysed and compared in terms of their classification accuracy, generating an ID3 decision tree. The vitality classes and thus also the attack stages of the spruce vegetation could be estimated with moderate to good accuracy using hyperspectral remote-sensing data. Clear spectral differences between the class with spruce trees that were still green but with reduced vitality (possibly the first stages of green-attack) and the class with healthy spruce trees could be ascertained. The best spectral characteristics, spectral indicators and spectral derivatives related to vitality classes and thus attack stages were typically based on wavebands related to prominent chlorophyll absorption features in the VI within the spectral range of 450-890 nm. Only limited spectral information and derivatives could be found in the short-wave infrared region 1 (SWIR) within the spectral range of 1400-1800 nm, which reflects the water content of the spruce needles. The class of spruce trees that were still green but with reduced vitality (possibly the first stages of green-attack) showed a trend towards detectability and differentiation with spectral indicators and index derivatives. However, the prediction of observed effects with 64% accuracy as observed here is regarded as insufficient in forestry practises. Hyperspectral data with a ground resolution of 4 m were found to contain more information relevant to estimating the vitality class of spruce vegetation compared to hyperspectral data with a ground resolution of 7 m.

The analyzed values of model variables, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), were calculated based on EnSRF without perturbed measurements. Independent datasets were used to test EnSRF and the root mean square error (RASE) values were 0.81 and 0.82 g m(-2), with relative error (RE) values of 0.15 and 0.13, for LAI and LNA, respectively.

These results indicated that the LAI and LNA values based on EnSRF matched the measured values well compared with the EnKF, WheatGrow and remote sensing models. In addition, the predicted results are consistent with the temporal and spatial distribution of winter wheat growth status and grain yields in the study area, with RE values of less than 0.2 and 0.1 for LAI and LNA, respectively.

That is, in many real-world applications the complexity and high-dimensionality of the data and/or process do not allow for routine model specification. For example, spatio-temporal count data often exhibit temporally varying over/underdispersion within the spatial domain. In order to accommodate such structure, while quantifying different sources of uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) model with dynamic dispersion. Motivated by the problem of predicting migratory bird settling patterns, we propose a threshold vector-autoregressive model for the CMP intensity parameter that allows for regime switching based on climate conditions. Additionally, to reduce the inherent high-dimensionality of the underlying process, we consider nonlinear dimension reduction through kernel principal component analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through out-of-sample one-year-ahead prediction of waterfowl migratory patterns across the United States and Canada. The proposed approach is of independent interest and illustrates the potential benefits of dynamic dispersion in terms of superior forecasting.

While the physical and biogeochemical variables are forecast mechanistically using the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the Chesapeake Bay, the species predictions are generated using a novel mechanistic-empirical approach, whereby real-time output from the coupled physical-biogeochemical model drives multivariate empirical habitat models of the target species. The predictions, in the form of digital images, are available via the World Wide Web to interested groups to guide recreational, management, and research activities. Though full validation of the integrated forecasts for all species is still a work in progress, we argue that the mechanistic-empirical approach can be used to generate a wide variety of short-term ecological forecasts, and that it can be applied in any marine system where sufficient data exist to develop empirical habitat models.

To date, the most successful marine invasive species in the Atlantic is the lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles), which, as for the panther grouper, is assumed to have been introduced to the wild through aquarium releases. However, unlike lionfish, the panther grouper is not yet thought to have an established breeding population in the Atlantic. Using a proven modeling technique developed to track the lionfish invasion, presented is the first known estimation of the potential spread of panther grouper in the Atlantic. The employed cellular automaton-based computer model examines the life history of the subject species including fecundity, mortality, and reproductive potential and combines this with habitat preferences and physical oceanic parameters to forecast the distribution and periodicity of spread of this potential new invasive species. Simulations were examined for origination points within one degree of capture locations of panther grouper from the United States Geological Survey Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database to eliminate introduction location bias, and two detailed case studies were scrutinized. The model indicates three primary locations where settlement is likely given the inputs and limits of the model; Jupiter Florida/Vero Beach, the Cape Hatteras Tropical Limit/Myrtle Beach South Carolina, and Florida Keys/Ten Thousand Islands locations. Of these locations, Jupiter Florida/Vero Beach has the highest settlement rate in the model and is indicated as the area in which the panther grouper is most likely to become established.

Although there have been numerous investigations on the physiology and ecology of the bark beetle, until now the spatio-temporal infestation and dispersal dynamics of the bark beetle over a longer period have still not been satisfactorily understood. The understanding of the structure and the dispersal of bark beetle infestations is however of significant importance for forest management systems in order to predict the risk of outbreaks, especially in the face of climate change. The aim of this investigation was therefore (I) to analyse and describe the long term spatio-temporal infestation patterns of I. typographus in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany on the landscape scale, (II) to conduct investigations on spatio-temporal shifts of the focal points of bark beetle infestations from 1988 to 2010 and (III) to compare the quantitative spatio-temporal infestation patterns obtained at the landscape level with the dispersal patterns of the spatially explicit agent-based simulation model (SAMBIA) for L typographus (Fahse and Heurich, 2011). The results of the study show that a shift in the infestation pattern of I. typographus from 1988 to 2010 occurs at different time intervals both undirectionally as well as directionally. Furthermore, the dispersal pattern of the bark beetle was recorded quantitatively and described extensively over a period of 23 years on the landscape scale. The quantification of the presence and dispersion pattern of I. typographus in the Bavarian Forest National Park allows us to gain a better understanding of the distribution pattern of the bark beetle on the landscape scale. In this way, both the pattern and structure of infestation patterns obtained for I. typographus serve as: (a) a basis for the criteria to improve the parameters of spatio-temporal simulation models, (b) a better understanding of the bark beetle pattern and existing processes such as disturbance patterns or damage patterns in the food web of spruces due to climate change, (c) a test for the hypotheses on the relationships between the presence of bark beetle and relevant habitat variables as well as (d) the compilation of forecast models on the dispersal of bark beetle. These predictions can help with the implementation of specific management strategies to prevent the dispersal of bark beetle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the Chesapeake Bay estuary was used as a model ""test bed"" to which we applied the power of near real-time satellite-derived observations to the issue of water quality monitoring. To use remote sensing in support of spatially complete estimates of salinity and temperature in the Bay, we tested geospatial interpolation techniques as a method for filling gaps and minimizing errors in the satellite record. These interpolated values were then compared to the output of a regional hydrodynamic model in order to assess the relative value of each method for generating inputs into various modeling applications. Results show that MODIS-derived salinity and temperature can be interpolated with acceptable accuracy in the Bay, with a mean absolute error of 1.88 psu and 0.60 degrees C. These errors differed systematically from ChesROMS errors both spatially and seasonally, with higher errors for salinity and lower errors for temperature at most sampling stations throughout the year.

Experience shows us that weather is already a driving influence in forest management as extreme-weather events cause substantial damage. Biotic and abiotic disturbances create significant uncertainty for managers, and present a significant risk of loss to the growing stock. Forecasts of climate change indicate increasing average temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. These forecasts also suggest more extreme-weather events. Changing weather patterns mean changing interactions between forests and disturbance agents, likely resulting in unprecedented levels of damage. Research forest managers have developed an approach to managing this uncertainty and risk through forest management planning. If climate change will lead to more extreme weather, it is expected that adapting to climate change will equate to managing risk. A retrospective examination of the response to the mountain pine beetle outbreak (1991-2005) has enabled us to document our approach to managing the risk of damage and loss. Forest management planning provides a framework to establish priorities, set objectives and devise strategies to maintain the values that are important on research forests as they adapt to climate change.

Despite these efforts, long-term phenological observations are still lacking for many species. If we could forecast responses based on taxonomic affinity, however, then we could leverage existing data to predict the climate-related phenological shifts of many taxa not yet studied. Methods: We examined phenological time series of 1226 species occurrences (1031 unique species in 119 families) across seven sites in North America and England to determine whether family membership (or family mean FFD) predicts the sensitivity of FFD to standardized interannual changes in temperature and precipitation during seasonal periods before flowering and whether families differ significantly in the direction of their phenological shifts. Key results: Patterns observed among species within and across sites are mirrored among family means across sites; early-flowering families advance their FFD in response to warming more than late-flowering families. By contrast, we found no consistent relationships among taxa between mean FFD and sensitivity to precipitation as measured here. Conclusions: Family membership can be used to identify taxa of high and low sensitivity to temperature within the seasonal, temperate zone plant communities analyzed here. The high sensitivity of early-flowering families (and the absence of early-flowering families not sensitive to temperature) may reflect plasticity in flowering time, which may be adaptive in environments where early-season conditions are highly variable among years.",,,,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012; Bolmgren, Kjell/E-1459-2016; Inouye, David W./C-2997-2011; Kraft, Nathan J.

To understand and forecast how ecosystems will change over the coming decades, scientists will require an understanding of the sensitivity of species to environmental change. The current distribution of species and functional groups provides valuable information about the performance of various species in different environments. However, when the rate of environmental change is high, information inherent in the ranges of many species will disappear, since that information exists only under more or less steady-state conditions. The amount of information about species' relationships to climate declines as their distributions move farther from steady state. New remote-sensing technologies can map the chemical and structural traits of plant canopies and will allow for the inference of traits and, in many cases, species' ranges. Current satellite remote-sensing data can only produce relatively simple classifications, but new techniques will produce data with dramatically higher biological information content.

The challenge is that some behaviors are poorly known and difficult to estimate. We assessed how uncertainty in behavioral responses to dense woods, an avoided landscape structure, impacts functional connectivity among reproductive habitat patches for Fender's blue butterfly, an endangered prairie species of western Oregon, USA. We designed a factorial simulation experiment using a spatially explicit individual-based model to project functional connectivity for female butterflies across current and alternative landscapes. We varied the probability of dense woods entry and turning angle standard deviation for movements within the dense woods over a range of biologically reasonable and observed values. Butterflies in the current landscape (46 % dense woods) and one with prairie encroached by forest (60 % dense woods) showed reductions in functional connectivity estimates consistent with the expectations of habitat fragmentation. Although dense woods entrance uncertainty impacted functional connectivity projections, uncertainty in the dense woods turning angle standard deviation had comparatively little impact on connectivity estimates. Reduction and reconfiguration of the current dense woods to 27 % cover (restored landscape) appeared to facilitate a corridor behavior in dispersing individuals, likely providing a functional connectivity estimate comparable to the historic landscape (< 5 % dense woods). Our simulations suggest that additional study of butterfly movement within the dense woods is unnecessary and that a partial reduction in dense woods would be sufficient to achieve historic levels of functional connectivity for Fender's blue across the study landscape.",,,,"McIntire, Eliot/F-7995-2011","McIntire, Eliot/0000-0002-6914-8316; Schultz, Cheryl/0000-0003-3388-8950",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Harmful algal blooms of the genus Microcystis were found in all 3 years, and the development of these blooms was associated with water temperatures >18 degrees C and wind stresses <0.04 Pa. Wind stresses >0.1 Pa were associated with bloom dispersement as were temperatures <18 degrees C.

Many data-driven models in hydrology have been criticised for their black-box characteristics, which prohibit adequate understanding of their mechanistic behaviour and restrict their wider heuristic value. In response, presented here is a new generic data-driven mechanistic modelling framework. The framework is significant because it incorporates an evaluation of the legitimacy of a data-driven model's internal modelling mechanism as a core element in the modelling process. The framework's value is demonstrated by two simple artificial neural network river forecasting scenarios. We develop a novel adaptation of first-order partial derivative, relative sensitivity analysis to enable each model's mechanistic legitimacy to be evaluated within the framework. The results demonstrate the limitations of standard, goodness-of-fit validation procedures by highlighting how the internal mechanisms of complex models that produce the best fit scores can have lower mechanistic legitimacy than simpler counterparts whose scores are only slightly inferior. Thus, our study directly tackles one of the key debates in data-driven, hydrological modelling: is it acceptable for our ends (i.e. model fit) to justify our means (i.e. the numerical basis by which that fit is achieved)?",,,,,"Abrahart, Robert/0000-0002-4068-7164; Dawson, Christian/0000-0003-2357-0105",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Plant phenology modeling has been shown to be the simplest and most useful tool to assess phenol-climate shifts. Temperature, solar radiation, and water availability are assumed to be the key factors that control plant phenology. Statistical, mechanistic, and theoretical approaches have often been used for the parameterization of plant phenology models. The statistical approaches correlate the timing of phenological events to environmental factors or heat unit accumulations. The approaches have the simplified calculation procedures, correct phenological mechanism assumptions, but limited applications and predictive abilities. The mechanistic approaches describe plant phenology with the known or assumed ""cause-effect relationships"" between biological processes and key driving variables. The mechanistic approaches have the improved parameter processes, realistic assumptions, broad applications, and effective predictions. The theoretical approaches assume cost-benefit tradeoff strategies in trees. These methods are capable of capturing and quantifying the potential impacts and consequences of global climate change and human activity. However, certain limitations still exist related to our understanding of phenological mechanisms in relation to (1) interactions between plants and their specific climates, (2) the integration of both field observational and remote sensing data with plant phenology models across taxa and ecosystem type, (3) amplitude clarification of scale-related sensitivity to global climate change, and (4) improvements in parameterization processes and the overall reduction of modeling uncertainties to forecast impacts of future climate change on plant phenological dynamics. To improve our capacity in the prediction of the amplitude of plant phenological responses with regard to both structural and functional sensitivity to future global climate change, it is important to refine modeling methodologies by applying long-term and large-scale observational data. It is equally important to consider other less used but critical factors (such as heredity, pests, and anthropogenic drivers), apply advanced model parameterization and data assimilation techniques, incorporate process-based plant phenology models as a dynamic component into global vegetation dynamic models, and test plant phenology models against long-term ground observations and high-resolution satellite data across different spatial and temporal scales.",,,,"_, __/C-1768-2014","_, __/0000-0002-1859-8966; deng, xiang wen/0000-0002-9399-1231",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

The endangered status of European eels Anguilla anguilla forces managers to make efforts to reduce this mortality. Among the mitigation measures used, turbine shutdowns appear to be an efficient method, but they involve a substantial financial loss for hydropower producers. To optimise the use of turbine shutdowns, the present study aimed to provide a precise but simple forecast of the migration peaks of migrant silver eels. We first developed a model to forecast silver eel migration using SARIMAX models and real biological data of silver eel migration from 2 fishing sites in Brittany (north-western France). This model combines exogenous covariates and past biological data to forecast future migrations. We then evaluated this model with several years of biological data from the same trap sites, based on the decision criterion that turbines should be shut down when the number of silver eels forecasted by our model represents >10% of the mean annual number of migrants. This model would have served to save 90 and 70% of eels on the Oir and Scorff Rivers, respectively, with only 3.3 to 5.6 turbine shutdowns per year on average. Initial shutdowns would have lasted 1 wk, but this study also showed that the duration of turbine shutdowns could be reduced to 2 d without a significant decrease in efficiency. SARIMAX models reduce the influence of exogenous factors in forecasting outcomes, these being the most variable factors in the current context of climate change. This model appears to be a powerful tool for ecological forecasting of endangered species in the context of global warming.",,,,,"Acou, Anthony/0000-0001-5166-0912",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENDANGER SPECIES RES,Endanger.

Theoretically, predictions of recruitment should be better when they are based on estimates of cohort size taken close to the age of recruitment and may improve if the effects of environmental factors that influence pre-recruit mortality are accounted for. In practice, measurement error and difficulties in establishing robust recruitment-environment relationships complicate the picture. For 5 fish stocks of 4 species in 3 ecosystems, we examined the usefulness of indices of juvenile abundance relative to larval abundance for predicting recruitment. Further, we examined whether the use of environmental covariates improved predictions. For 2 of 4 stocks with sufficient data (1 stock did not have larval data), juvenile abundance was a better predictor of recruitment compared to larval indices. For the 2 other stocks, we found that juvenile indices were not superior to larval indices, possibly because of error in the measurement of juvenile abundance. In all 5 of these stocks, regression analysis showed that inclusion of environmental correlates contributed significantly to explaining recruitment variation compared to models based on juvenile indices alone. Further, cross validation showed that forecasts of future recruitment were either improved or qualitatively unchanged by including environmental correlates.

Quantitative models generally measured single risk components (78% of studies), often focusing on Establishment alone (79%). Although dominant in academia, quantitative RAs are underused in policy, and should be made more accessible. Accommodating heterogeneous limited data, combining across risk components, and developing generalised RAs across species, space and time without requiring new models for each species may increase attractiveness for policy applications. Comparatively, scoring approaches covered more risk components (50% examined > 3 components), with Impact being the most common component (87%), and have been widely applied in policy (> 57%), but primarily employed expert opinion.

This study aims to develop two ecological models forecasting future chlorophyll a at two time-steps (one-week and one-year forecasts), using recurrent neural networks tuned by genetic algorithm (GA-RNN). A moving average (MA) method pre-processes the data for both short- and long-term forecasting to evaluate the effect of noise downscaling on model predictability and to estimate its usefulness and trend prediction for management purposes. Twenty-five physicochemical and biological components (e.g. water temperature, DO, pH, dams discharge, river flow, rainfall, zooplankton abundance, nutrient concentration, etc. from 1994 to 2006) are used as input variables to predict chlorophyll a. GA-RNN models show a satisfactory level of performance for both predictions. Using genetic operations in the network training enables us to avoid numerous trial-and-error model constructions. MA-smoothed data improves the predictivity of models by removing residuals in the data prediction and enhancing the trend of time-series patterns. The results demonstrate efficient development of ecological models through selecting appropriate network structures. Data pre-processing with MA helps in forecasting long-term seasonality and trend of chlorophyll a, an important outcome for decision makers because it provides more reaction time to establish and control management strategies.",,,,"Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/O-6355-2014","Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/0000-0001-7721-4937; McKay, Bob/0000-0003-3160-5822",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT J ENVIRON RES,Int.

From an ensemble of forecasts generated by 5 distinct algorithms (generalized linear models, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and alternating decision trees), we calculated consensus predictions for current conditions and 3 future time periods (2030, 2050 and 2080) under low and high scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. Three criteria were examined to infer the robustness of the forecasts: ability to predict current distributions, inter-model variability and degree of environmental extrapolation. Our results indicate an overall decline in climatic suitability for the 4 invaders as time progresses. However, we also identified highly distinct levels of predictive uncertainty among species. Good indicators of reliability were found for Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, whereas the predictions for C. destructor showed low predictive performance, low inter-model agreement and wide areas of environmental extrapolation. For E. sinensis, the models also showed high variability with respect to areas projected to lose climatic suitability.

At the field level, the close correlation between green leaf area (GLA) during maturation and grain yield in wheat revealed that the onset and rate of senescence appeared to be important factors for determining wheat grain yield. Our study sought to explore a simple approach for wheat yield forecasting at the regional level, based on metrics derived from the senescence phase of the green area index (GAI) retrieved from remote sensing data. This study took advantage of recent methodological improvements in which imagery with high revisit frequency but coarse spatial resolution can be exploited to derive crop-specific GAI time series by selecting pixels whose ground-projected instantaneous field of view is dominated by the target crop: winter wheat. A logistic function was used to characterize the GAI senescence phase and derive the metrics of this phase. Four regression-based models involving these metrics (i.e., the maximum GAI value, the senescence rate and the thermal time taken to reach 50% of the green surface in the senescent phase) were related to official wheat yield data. The performances of such models at this regional scale showed that final yield could be estimated with an RMSE of 0.57 ton ha(-1), representing about 7% as relative RMSE. Such an approach may be considered as a first yield estimate that could be performed in order to provide better integrated yield assessments in operational systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To make this process less subjective and more repeatable, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that produces superior yield forecasts/estimates, while quantifying different sources of uncertainty. The proposed hierarchical model naturally combines information from multiple monthly surveys measured on different temporal supports, including a field measurement survey and two farmer interview surveys. The dependence between the monthly updated surveys and the serial dependence of the annual yield are incorporated at different levels of the hierarchy. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an application from the US Department of Agriculture.

Anticipating the potential effects of changes in species distributions requires models capable of forecasting population spread across realistic; heterogeneous landscapes and subject to spatiotemporal variability in habitat suitability. Several decades of theory and model development, as well as increased computing power and availability of fine-resolution GIS data, now make such models possible. Still unanswered, however, is the question of how well this new generation of dynamic models will anticipate range expansion. Here we develop a spatially explicit stochastic model that combines dynamic dispersal and population processes with fine-resolution maps characterizing spatiotemporal heterogeneity in climate and habitat to model range expansion of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae). We parameterize this model using multiyear data sets describing population and dispersal dynamics of HWA and apply it to eastern North America over a 57-year period (1951-2008). To evaluate the model, the observed pattern of spread of HWA during this same period was compared to model predictions. Our model predicts considerable heterogeneity in the risk of HWA invasion across space and through time, and it suggests that spatiotemporal variation in winter temperature, rather than hemlock abundance, exerts a primary control on the spread of HWA. Although the simulations generally matched the observed current extent of the invasion of HWA and patterns of anisotropic spread, it did not correctly predict when HWA was observed to arrive in different geographic regions. We attribute differences between the modeled and observed dynamics to an inability to capture the timing and direction of long-distance dispersal events that substantially affected the ensuing pattern of spread.",,,,"Fitzpatrick, Matt/F-7620-2010; Preisser, Evan/C-3469-2013","Fitzpatrick, Matt/0000-0003-1911-8407; Preisser, Evan/0000-0002-8737-5619; Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Our new hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model is primarily intended for simulating the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu within a time frame of 1-5 days. The model combines two modules: a simple phytoplankton kinetics module for growth and loss; and a mass-transport module, which defines phytoplankton transport horizontally with a two dimensional hydrodynamic model. To adapt field data for model input and calibration, we introduce two simplifications: (a) exclusion of some processes related to phytoplankton dynamics like nutrient dynamics, sediment resuspension, mineralization and nitrification, and (b) use of monthly measured data of the nutrient state. Chlorophyll-a concentration, representing phytoplankton biomass, is the only state variable in the model. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the most sensitive parameter set in the phytoplankton kinetics module. The model was calibrated with field data collected in 2008 and validated with additional data obtained in 2009. A comparison of simulated and observed chlorophyll-a concentration for 33 grid cells achieved an accuracy of 78.7%. However, mean percent error and mean absolute percent error were 13.4% and 58.2%, respectively, which implies that further improvement is necessary, e.g. by reducing uncertainty of the model input and by an improved parameter calibration.

Larval abundances were weighted for size-and temperature-dependent mortality to project the number attaining a critical size of 15 mm; this weighting reflects the greater survival value of larger larvae to the population. The method was applied to catches in the 2007 and 2008 larval surveys to show the feasibility of attaining near real-time estimates. The accuracy of the method to forecast recruitment was evaluated from historical data. Adjusting larval abundance for size-and temperature-dependent mortality improved the trend with recruitment, but the relationship was not significant over the entire time series (1979 to 2007) because of an increasing trend in predators of juvenile stages, decoupling the parameters. A threshold-based generalized additive recruitment forecast model was developed to account for autocorrelative structure caused by inter-cohort interactions and mortality-related factors occurring after the larval period. The model closely tracks past recruitment trends. Based on low larval abundances and high numbers of predators, low to moderate abundances of age-4 recruits were predicted for 2007 to 2011, which matched observed levels reasonably well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Therefore, it is important to have an accurate model for rainfall forecasting. Recently, several data-driven modeling approaches have been investigated to perform such forecasting tasks as multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP-NN). In fact, the rainfall time series modeling involves an important temporal dimension. On the other hand, the classical MLP-NN is a static and has a memoryless network architecture that is effective for complex nonlinear static mapping. This research focuses on investigating the potential of introducing a neural network that could address the temporal relationships of the rainfall series. Two different static neural networks and one dynamic neural network, namely the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and input delay neural network (IDNN), respectively, have been examined in this study. Those models had been developed for the two time horizons for monthly and weekly rainfall forecasting at Klang River, Malaysia. Data collected over 12 yr (1997-2008) on a weekly basis and 22 yr (1987-2008) on a monthly basis were used to develop and examine the performance of the proposed models. Comprehensive comparison analyses were carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed static and dynamic neural networks. Results showed that the MLP-NN neural network model is able to follow trends of the actual rainfall, however, not very accurately. RBFNN model achieved better accuracy than the MLP-NN model.

Two assimilation strategies are considered: one based on Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and the second on recalibration/re-initialisation of uncertain model parameters and initial state conditions. The main objective of the OSS Experiment is to estimate the requisites for the remotely sensed LAI, in terms of accuracy and sampling frequency, to reach target of either 25 or 50% reduction of errors on the final estimation of grain yields. Our results demonstrate that EnKF is not suitable for assimilating LAI in WOFOST as the average error on final grain yields estimation globally increases. These poor results can be explained by the possible differences of phenological development existing between assimilated and modelled LAI values (difference called ""phenological shift"" in our study) which is not corrected by the EnKF-based assimilation strategy. On the contrary, a recalibration-based assimilation approach globally improves the estimation of final grain yields in a significant way. On average, such improvement can reach up to approximately 65% when observations are available all along the growing season. Improvements on the order of 20% can be already be attained early in the season, which is of great interest in a crop yield forecasting perspective. If the first objective (25%) of error reduction on final grain yields can be reached in a quite high number of assimilated LAI observations availabilities and uncertainty levels, the field of possibilities is significantly restricted for the second objective (50%) and implies to have LAI observations available all along the growing season, at least on a weekly basis and with an uncertainty level equal or ideally lower than 10%. These requirements are not currently met from neither a technological nor an operational point of view but the results presented here can provide guidelines for future missions dedicated to crop growth monitoring.

Performances of the models are assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), and Area under the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Chlorophyll-a have been used to estimate algal biomass in aquatic ecosystem as it is common in most algae. Algal biomass indicates of the trophic status of a water body. Chlorophyll-a therefore, is an effective indicator for monitoring eutrophication which is a common problem of lakes and reservoirs all over the world. Assessments of these predictive models are necessary towards developing a reliable algorithm to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration for eutrophication management of tropical lakes. Results: Same data set was used for models development and the data was divided into two sets; training and testing to avoid biasness in results. FL and RANN models were developed using parameters selected through sensitivity analysis. The selected variables were water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and Secchi depth. Dissolved oxygen, selected through stepwise procedure, was used to develop the MLR model. HEA model used parameters selected using genetic algorithm (GA). The selected parameters were pH, Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen.

Gravity models provide one of the most useful techniques available to model dispersal of nonindigenous invasive species (NIS) across heterogeneous landscapes, as these models are able to capture transport patterns of recreational boaters who are dominant vectors responsible for aquatic NIS dispersal. Despite the widespread use of gravity models in forecasting biological invasions, different classes of gravity models have not been evaluated regarding their comparative ability to capture recreational transport patterns and subsequent use in predicting NIS establishment. Here we evaluate model selection between unconstrained, total-flowconstrained, production-constrained and doubly-constrained stochastic gravity models to assess dispersal of the spiny waterflea Bythotrephes between Ontario lakes. Differences between the models relate to the amount of data required and constraints under which calculations of source/destination interactions are made. For each class of gravity model, we then estimated the probability of a lake having established Bythotrephes populations by modeling the relationship between empirical presence/absence data and inbound recreational traffic (i.e. propagule pressure) via boosted regression. The unconstrained gravity model provided the best fit to observed traffic patterns of recreational boaters. However, when output from the gravity models was used to predict Bythotrephes establishment, the doubly-constrained gravity model provided the strongest relationship between inbound recreational traffic and observed Bythotrephes presence/absence, followed by the production-constrained model. Our results indicate production-constrained gravity models offer an acceptable balance between modeling recreational boater traffic and their utility to estimate establishment probabilities.",,,,"macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020","Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

These factors can be used to develop an stability index which determines states of water-in-oil emulsion in terms of either an unstable, entrained, mesostable or stable conditions. It is important to note that most of the regression models cannot capture the non-linear relationships involved in the formation of these emulsions. This study deals with the prediction of water-in-oil emulsions stability by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with basic compositional factors such as density, viscosity and percentages of SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes) components. In the computational method, grid partition and subtractive clustering fuzzy inference systems were tried to generate the optimum fuzzy rule base sets. The stability estimation was conducted by applying hybrid learning algorithm and the model performance was tested by the means of distinct test data set randomly selected from the experimental domain. The ANFIS-based predictions were also compared to the conventional regression approach by means of various descriptive statistical indicators, such as root mean-square error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), the factor of two (FA2), fractional variance (FV), proportion of systematic error (PSE), etc. With trying various types of fuzzy inference system (FIS) structures and several numbers of training epochs ranging from 1 to 100, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 2.0907) and the highest determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.967) were obtained with subtractive clustering method of a first-order Sugeno type FIS. For the optimum ANFIS structure, input variables were fuzzified with four Gaussian membership functions, and the number of training epochs was computed as 21. In the computational analysis, the predictive performance of the ANFIS model was examined for the following ranges of the clustering parameters: range of influence (ROI) = 0.45-0.60, squash factor (SF) = 1.20-1.35, accept ratio (AR) = 0.40-0.55, and reject ratio (RR) = 0.10-0.20. Results indicated that ROI, SF, AR and RR were obtained to be 0.54, 1.25, 0.50 and 0.15, respectively, for the best FIS structure. It was clearly concluded that the proposed ANFIS model demonstrated a superior predictive performance on forecasting of water-in-oil emulsions stability. Findings of this study clearly indicated that the neuro-fuzzy modeling could be successfully used for predicting the stability of a specific water-in-oil mixture to provide a good discrimination between several visual stability conditions.

We integrate multiple sources of vegetation data, assembled from sparsely distributed (regional-scale) forest inventory and analysis (FIA) plots and more densely distributed (landscape-scale) plots for monitoring sudden oak death, and develop spatial prediction models based on correlation with environmental variables and spatial dependencies in host abundance.

A total of 436 million U. californica trees (14 Tg C) occur across 4.2 million ha which frequently overlap with Quercus and N. densiflorus host populations. Combination of landscape-scale data with FIA data resulted in more accurate estimation of host populations and their carbon contents. Forests of northern California and southwest Oregon have the highest concentration of the most susceptible hosts along with climatic conditions that favor pathogen spread. This study represents the first spatially-explicit estimate of P. ramorum host populations and their carbon contents which exceed previously published estimates. Our results will inform landscape- to regional-scale models of disease dynamics and guide management decisions regarding ecosystem impacts including risk of C release following widespread tree mortality.

This paper presents a model linking wading bird foraging numbers to hydrologic conditions in the ENP. Seasonal hydrologic statistics derived from a single water level recorder are well correlated with water depths throughout most areas of the ENP, and are effective as predictors of wading bird numbers when using a nonlinear hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the conditional distribution of bird populations. Model parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure. Parameter and model uncertainty is assessed as a byproduct of the estimation process. Water depths at the beginning of the nesting season, the average dry season water level, and the numbers of reversals from the dry season recession are identified as significant predictors, consistent with the hydrologic conditions considered important in the production and concentration of prey organisms in this system. Long-term hydrologic records at the index location allow for a retrospective analysis (1952-2006) of foraging bird numbers showing low frequency oscillations in response to decadal fluctuations in hydroclimatic conditions. Simulations of water levels at the index location used in the Bayesian model under alternative water management scenarios allow the posterior probability distributions of the number of foraging birds to be compared, thus providing a mechanism for linking management schemes to seasonal rainfall forecasts.",,,,"Kwon, Hyun-Han/A-9808-2015; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009; Kwon, Hyun-Han/AAC-4359-2020","Kwon, Hyun-Han/0000-0003-4465-2708; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

Ongoing forecast efforts predict the extent of the summer hypoxic/anoxic area due to nutrient loads from the watershed. However, these models neither predict DO levels nor address the intricate interactions among various ecological processes. The prediction of spatially explicit DO levels in the Chesapeake Bay can eventually lead to a reliable depiction of the comprehensive ecological structure and functioning, and can also allow the quantification of the role of nutrient reduction strategies in water quality management. In this paper, we describe a three dimensional empirical model to predict DO levels in the Chesapeake Bay as a function of water temperature, salinity and dissolved nutrient concentrations (TDN and TDP). The residual analysis shows that predicted DO values compare well with observations. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) are used to evaluate the performance of the empirical model; the scores demonstrate the usability of model predictions (NSE, surface layer = 0.82-0.86; middle layer = 0.65-0.82; bottom layer = 0.70-0.82; RSR surface layer = 0.37-0.44; middle layer = 0.43-0.58 and bottom layer = 0.43-0.54). The predicted DO values and other physical outputs from downscaling of regional weather and climate predictions, or forecasts from hydrodynamic models, can be used to forecast various ecological components.

Recruitment is highly variable and depends on a variety of factors, such as the size of the spawning stock and environmental conditions in the area. The use of a coupled model that could serve to predict the evolution of the anchovy stock in the short, medium, and long term under several fishing-pressure scenarios and given climate scenarios is demonstrated. This coupled model consists of a Gadget (Globally Applicable Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) model that was used to analyse the status of the Bay of Biscay anchovy population and to simulate future scenarios based on the estimated recruitment levels, combined with a probabilistic Bayesian network model for recruitment estimation based on machine-learning methods and using climatic indices as potential forecasting factors.

These forces include (1) dramatically increased volumes of data from observational and experimental networks, (2) increases in computational power, (3) advances in ecological models and related statistical and optimization methodologies, and most importantly, (4) societal needs to develop better strategies for natural resource management in a world of ongoing global change. Traditionally, ecological forecasting has been based on process-oriented models, informed by data in largely ad hoc ways. Although most ecological models incorporate some representation of mechanistic processes, today's models are generally not adequate to quantify real-world dynamics and provide reliable forecasts with accompanying estimates of uncertainty. A key tool to improve ecological forecasting and estimates of uncertainty is data assimilation (DA), which uses data to inform initial conditions and model parameters, thereby constraining a model during simulation to yield results that approximate reality as closely as possible. This paper discusses the meaning and history of DA in ecological research and highlights its role in refining inference and generating forecasts. DA can advance ecological forecasting by (1) improving estimates of model parameters and state variables, (2) facilitating selection of alternative model structures, and (3) quantifying uncertainties arising from observations, models, and their interactions. However, DA may not improve forecasts when ecological processes are not well understood or never observed. Overall, we suggest that DA is a key technique for converting raw data into ecologically meaningful products, which is especially important in this era of dramatically increased availability of data from observational and experimental networks.",,,,,"LaDeau, Shannon/0000-0003-4825-5435",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Dynamic spread modelling is a potentially valuable tool to assist regional and central government authorities to monitor and control invasive species. To date a lack of suitable data has meant that most broad scale dispersal models have not been validated with independent datasets, and so their predictive ability and reliability has remained unscrutinised. A dynamic, stochastic dispersal model of the widely invasive plant Buddleja davidii was calibrated on European spread data and then used to project the temporal progression of B. davidii's distribution in New Zealand, starting from several different historical distributions. To assess the model's performance, we constructed an occupancy map based on the average number of simulation realisations that have a population present. The application of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to occupancy maps is introduced, but with specificity substituted by the proportion of available area used in a realisation. A derivative measure, the partial area under these curves when assessed through time (pAUC), is introduced and used to assess overall performance of the spread model. The model was able to attain a high level of model sensitivity, encompassing all of the known locations within the occupancy envelope. However, attempting to simulate the spread of this invasive species beyond a decade had very low model specificity. This is due to several factors, including the exponential process of spread (the further a population spreads the more sites exist from which it can spread stochastically), and the Markovian chain property of the stochastic system whereby differences between realisations compound through time. These features are seen in many reports of spread models, without being explicitly acknowledged. Our measure of pAUC through time allows a model's temporal performance and its specificity to be simultaneously assessed. While the rapid deterioration in model performance limits the utility of this type of modelling for forecasting long-term broad-scale strategic management of biological invasions, it does not necessarily limit its attractiveness for informing smaller scale and shorter term invasion management activities such as surveillance, containment and local eradication.

Predictions of the potential distributions of invasive species under climate change will provide critical information for future conservation and management strategies. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to invasive species and climate change, but the effect of climate change on invasive species distributions has been rather neglected, especially for notorious global invaders. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used ecological niche models (ENMs) to assess the risks and opportunities that climate change presents for the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which is a worldwide aquatic invasive species. Linking the factors of climate, topography, habitat and human influence, we developed predictive models incorporating both native and non-native distribution data of the crayfish to identify present areas of potential distribution and project the effects of future climate change based on a consensus-forecast approach combining the CCCMA and HADCM3 climate models under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) by 2050. The minimum temperature from the coldest month, the human footprint and precipitation of the driest quarter contributed most to the species distribution models. Under both the A2a and B2a scenarios, P. clarkii shifted to higher latitudes in continents of both the northern and southern hemispheres. However, the effect of climate change varied considerately among continents with an expanding potential in Europe and contracting changes in others. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings are the first to predict the impact of climate change on the future distribution of a globally invasive aquatic species. We confirmed the complexities of the likely effects of climate change on the potential distribution of globally invasive species, and it is extremely important to develop wide-ranging and effective control measures according to predicted geographical shifts and changes.",,,,"Liu, Xuan/AAF-3703-2020; wang, su/AAC-6313-2019","Liu, Xuan/0000-0003-1572-1268; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,30-Mar,2011,6,3,,,,,,,e18429,10.1371/journal.pone.0018429,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000289055700056,,,,,

The dispersion calculations are carried out over the 10 days showing the highest intensity of clear-air returns from the 2005 emergence season. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used to simulate the meteorological conditions during each of the 10 emergence days. Cumulative clear-air returns throughout each emergence day are used to estimate the distribution of beetle emergence times and atmospheric residence times. Evaluation of the WRF model output is presented using both surface and upper air observations. Evaluation of the HYSPLIT model is performed through a comparison of the vertical distribution of MPB observed in a previous study. A secondary HYSPLIT evaluation is performed using aerial surveys taken during the following summer (2006), which identify the previous years' beetle-infested regions. Beetle flight distances from the time of beetle emergence to the time of peak clear-air returns are calculated for each trajectory, and the distribution of all flight distances is presented. The mean back trajectory distance is 20.2 km with a standard deviation of 13.6 km. These values represent the MPB flight distance during half of the beetle atmospheric residence time, and typical daily wind-assisted dispersion distances would be expected to be roughly double this value.

This paper proposes the use of stochastic gravity models in ecology, which provides new capabilities both in model building and in potential model applications. These models allow us to use standard statistical inference tools such as maximum likelihood estimation and model selection based on information criteria. To facilitate prediction, we use only those covariates that are easily available from common data sources and can be forecasted in future. This is important for forecasting the spread of invasive species in geographical and temporal domain. The proposed model is portable, that is it can be used for estimating relative boater traffic and hence relative propagule pressure for the lakes not covered by current boater surveys.

Models that accurately predict where new invasions will occur could guide the efficient allocation of resources to slow colonization. We assessed the accuracy of a model that predicts the probability of colonization of lakes in Wisconsin by Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). We based this predictive model on 9 years (1990-1999) of sequence data of milfoil colonization of lakes larger than 25 ha (n = 1803). We used milfoil colonization sequence data from 2000 to 2006 to test whether the model accurately predicted the number of lakes that actually were colonized from among the 200 lakes identified as being most likely to be colonized. We found that a lake's predicted probability of colonization was not correlated with whether a lake actually was colonized. Given the low predictability of colonization of specific lakes, we compared the efficacy of preventing milfoil from leaving occupied sites, which does not require predicting colonization probability, with protecting vacant sites from being colonized, which does require predicting colonization probability. Preventing organisms from leaving colonized sites reduced the likelihood of spread more than protecting vacant sites.

Preventative strategies such as the development of models that forecast virus disease outbreaks together with host plant resistance, cultural and physical tactics are the most effective ways to control non-persistently transmitted viruses. A reduction in vector numbers using conventional systemic insecticides or inundative biological control agents can also provide effective control of persistently transmitted viruses. Recent advances on understanding of the mode of transmission of plant viruses are also a very promising way to develop molecules to block putative virus binding sites within the vector and to avoid virus retention and transmission.

This complexity increases uncertainty in ecological forecasts, and impedes preparation for the ecological consequences of climate change. We describe a recently developed ""multi-modeling"" system for ecological forecasting in a 7600 km(2) watershed in the North American Great Lakes Basin. Using a series of linked land cover, climate, hydrologic, hydraulic, thermal, loading, and biological response models, we examined how changes in both land cover and climate may interact to shape the habitat suitability of river segments for common sport fishes and alter patterns of biological integrity. In scenario-based modeling, both climate and land use change altered multiple ecosystem properties. Because water temperature has a controlling influence on species distributions, sport fishes were overall more sensitive to climate change than to land cover change. However, community-based biological integrity metrics were more sensitive to land use change than climate change; as were nutrient export rates.

Five input variables such as volumetric organic loading rate (OLR), volumetric total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal rate (R-V), influent alkalinity, influent pH and effluent pH were fuzzified by the use of an artificial intelligence-based approach. Trapezoidal membership functions with eight levels were conducted for the fuzzy subsets, and a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system was used to implement a total of 134 rules in the IF-THEN format. The product (prod) and the centre of gravity (COG, centroid) methods were employed as the inference operator and defuzzification methods, respectively. Fuzzy-logic predicted results were compared with the outputs of two exponential non-linear regression models derived in this study. The UASB reactor showed a remarkable performance on the treatment of molasses wastewater, with an average TCOD removal efficiency of 93 (+/-3)% and an average volumetric TCOD removal rate of 6.87 (+/-3.93) kg TCODremoved/m(3)-day, respectively. Findings of this study clearly indicated that, compared to non-linear regression models, the proposed MIMO fuzzy-logic-based model produced smaller deviations and exhibited a superior predictive performance on forecasting of both biogas and methane production rates with satisfactory determination coefficients over 0.98.

We provide a synthesis of climate change effects on native bark beetles, important mortality agents of conifers in western North America. Because of differences in temperature-dependent life-history strategies, including cold-induced mortality and developmental timing, responses to warming will differ among and within bark beetle species. The success of bark beetle populations will also be influenced indirectly by the effects of climate on community associates and host-tree vigor, although little information is available to quantify these relationships. We used available population models and climate forecasts to explore the responses of two eruptive bark beetle species. Based on projected warming, increases in thermal regimes conducive to population success are predicted for Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby) and Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, although there is considerable spatial and temporal variability.

Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.",,,,"Midgley, Guy F./H-3585-2014; Le Maitre, David/M-8791-2015; Yates, Colin/B-5972-2011; Elith, Jane/F-2022-2015; West, Adam G/E-8740-2010","Midgley, Guy F./0000-0001-8264-0869; Le Maitre, David/0000-0003-1037-6637; Elith, Jane/0000-0002-8706-0326; West, Adam G/0000-0002-9352-9282; Latimer, Andrew/0000-0001-8098-0448",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,JUN,2010,35,4,,,,,374,391,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.02044.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000278107600003,,,,,

Methods Three approaches were considered: (1) incorporating models of species migration to understand the ability of a species to occupy suitable habitat in new locations; (2) linking models of landscape disturbance and succession to models of habitat suitability; and (3) fully linking models of habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and spatially explicit population dynamics. Results Linking species-environment relationships, landscape dynamics and population dynamics in a multi-modelling framework allows the combined impacts of climate change (affecting species distribution and vital rates) and land cover dynamics (land use change, altered disturbance regimes) on species to be predicted. This approach is only feasible if the life history parameters and habitat requirements of the species are well understood.

Current challenges in the application of these tools include: (1) accounting for large uncertainty in model parameters, which may violate assumptions of ""local"" perturbation metrics such as sensitivities and elasticities, and (2) forecasting not only asymptotic rates of spatial spread, as is usually done, but also transient spatial dynamics in the early stages of invasion. We developed an invasion model for the Diaprepes root weevil (DRW; Diaprepes abbreviatus [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]), a generalist herbivore that has invaded citrus-growing regions of the United States. We synthesized data on DRW demography and dispersal and generated predictions for asymptotic and transient peak invasion speeds, accounting for parameter uncertainty. We quantified the contributions of each parameter toward invasion speed using a ""global"" perturbation analysis, and we contrasted parameter contributions during the transient and asymptotic phases. We found that the asymptotic invasion speed was 0.02-0.028 km/week, although the transient peak invasion speed (0.03- 0.045 km/week) was significantly greater. Both asymptotic and transient invasions speeds were most responsive to weevil dispersal distances. However, demographic parameters that had large effects on asymptotic speed (e.g., survival of early-instar larvae) had little effect on transient speed. Comparison of the global analysis with lower-level elasticities indicated that local perturbation analysis would have generated unreliable predictions for the responsiveness of invasion speed to underlying parameters. Observed range expansion in southern Florida (1992-2006) was significantly lower than the invasion speed predicted by the model. Possible causes of this mismatch include overestimation of dispersal distances, demographic rates, and spatiotemporal variation in parameter values. This study demonstrates, that, when parameter uncertainty is large, as is often the case, global perturbation analyses are needed to identify which points in the life cycle should be targets of management. Our results also suggest that effective strategies for reducing spread during the asymptotic phase may have little effect during the transient phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Since Sin Nombre virus was discovered in the U.S. in 1993, longitudinal studies of the rodent reservoir host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) have demonstrated a qualitative correlation among mouse population dynamics and risk of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, indicating the importance of understanding deer mouse population dynamics for evaluating risk of HPS. 2. Using capture-mark-recapture statistical methods on a 15-year data set from Montana, we estimated deer mouse survival, maturation and recruitment rates and tested the relative importance of seasonality, population density and local climate in explaining temporal variation in deer mouse demography. 3. From these estimates, we designed a population model to simulate deer mouse population dynamics given climatic variables and compared the model to observed patterns. 4. Month, precipitation 5 months previously, temperature 5 months previously and to a lesser extent precipitation and temperature in the current month, were important in determining deer mouse survival. Month, the sum of precipitation over the last 4 months, and the sum of the temperature over the last 4 months were important in determining recruitment rates. Survival was more important in determining the growth rate of the population than recruitment. 5. While climatic drivers appear to have a complex influence on dynamics, our forecasts were good.

Location Austria. Methods Species distribution models, which deliver habitat-based information on potential distributions, and interacting particle systems, which simulate spatio-temporal range dynamics as dependent on neighbourhood configurations, were combined into a common framework. We then used the combined model to simulate the invasion of A. artemisiifolia in Austria between 1990 and 2005. For comparison, simulations were also performed with models that accounted only for habitat suitability or neighbourhood configurations. The fit of the three models to the data was assessed by likelihood ratio tests, and simulated invasion patterns were evaluated against observed ones in terms of predictive discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I). Results The combined model fitted the data significantly better than the single-component alternatives. Simulations relying solely on parameterized spread kernels performed worst in terms of both AUC and spatial pattern formation. Simulations based only on habitat information correctly predicted infestation of susceptible areas but reproduced the autocorrelated patterns of A. artemisiifolia expansion less adequately than did the integrated model. Main conclusions Our integrated modelling approach offers a flexible tool for forecasts of spatio-temporal invasion patterns from landscape to regional scales. As a further advantage, scenarios of environmental change can be incorporated consistently by appropriately updating habitat suitability layers.

BWYV, which is persistently aphid-borne, spreads to B. napus crops from external sources and causes substantial yield losses when there is widespread infection of young plants. Risk that such losses may occur depends on the magnitude and availability of viral inoculum in the external source, the amount of biomass available to support aphid vectors, its duration before crop emergence, and the time of arrival of vector aphids in the crop. The model uses daily rainfall, temperature, and evaporation data from over 450 sites in the grainbelt of south-western Australia to track biomass levels throughout the growing season. This information is then used to simulate aphid vector populations and virus incidence, initially in the external source environment, then in the crop, and ultimately to provide risk forecasts. The model predicted BWYV spread successfully for 10 of 12 different datasets from 3 years of field observations on B. napus blocks at 4 sites representing different rainfall and geographic zones of the grainbelt.

There is a critical need to forecast tree mortality to guide forest management decisions. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery provides inexpensive and frequent coverage over large areas, facilitating forest health monitoring. This study examined time series of MODIS satellite images to forecast tree mortality for a Pinus radiata plantation in southern New South Wales, Australia. Dead tree density derived from ADS40 aerial imagery was used to evaluate the performance of change metrics derived from time series of MODIS-based vegetation indices. Continuous subset selection by LASSO regression and model assessment using a variant of the bootstrap were used to select the best performing change metrics out of a large amount of predictor variables to account for over-fitting. The results suggest that 250 m 16-daily MODIS images are effective for forecasting tree mortality. Seasonal change metrics derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) outperformed the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). Temporal analysis illustrated that optimal forecasting power was obtained using change metrics based on three years of satellite data for this population. The forecast could be used to optimise the scheduling of detailed forest health surveys and silvicultural operations which currently are planned based on stratified, annual assessments. This coarse-scale, spatio-temporal analysis represents a potentially cost-effective early warning approach to forecasting tree mortality in pine plantations by identifying compartments that require more detailed investigation.

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be con. dent in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples ( both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie.

In fact, stability number and damage level are closely related random variables and their relationship can best be modeled by methods that explicitly take uncertainty into account as vagueness, ambiguities, and imprecision. Fuzzy logic (FL) approach is one of these methods that can deal with nonlinear, complex and uncertain systems. In this paper, the use of non-traditional FL technique is employed as a means to develop efficient predictive model for designing conventional rubble mound structures. A total of 579 experimental small and large scale test data from Van der Meer are used for calibration and verification. FL model results are compared with empirical Van der Meer model in addition to the artificial neural network (ANN) model of Mase et al. It is shown that one can forecast the stability number of conventional rubble mound structures with more significant accuracy by the FL approach than previous models. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly true given the idiosyncratic nature of invasions, in which both historical and local conditions affect establishment success and hinder our ability to generate guidelines for early detection and eradication of invasive species. To overcome these limitations we have implemented a comprehensive approach that examines plant invasions at three spatial scales: regional, landscape, and local levels. At each scale, in combination with the others, we have evaluated the role of key environmental variables such as climate, landscape structure, habitat type, and canopy closure in the spread of three commonly found invasive woody plant species in New England, Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Euonymus alatus. We developed a spatially explicit hierarchical Bayesian model that allowed us to take into account the ongoing nature of the spread of invasive species and to incorporate presence/absence data from the species' native ranges as well as from the invaded regions. Comparisons between predictions from climate-only models with those from the multiscale forecasts emphasize the importance of including landscape structure in our models of invasive species' potential distributions. In addition, predictions generated using only native range data performed substantially worse than those that incorporated data from the target range. This points out important limitations in extrapolating distributional ranges from one region to another.",,,,"Wilson, Adam/C-6731-2009","Wilson, Adam/0000-0003-3362-7806",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Soil data from soil surveys and climate data from meteorological records were employed. Grain production information from statistics at county level was integrated at a geomorphological level. The Pampas was divided into 10 geographical units and data from 10 growing season were used (1995-2004). Surface regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) methodologies were tested for analyzing the data. Wheat yield was correlated to soil available water holding capacity (SAWHC) in the upper 100 cm of the profiles (r(2) = 0.39) and soil organic carbon (SOC) content (r(2) = 0.26). The climate factor with stronger effect on yield was the rainfall/crop potential evapotranspiration ratio (R/CPET) during the fallow and vegetative crop growing cycle periods summed (r(2) = 0.31). The phototermal quotient (PQ) during the pre-anthesis period had also a significant effect on yield (r(2) = 0.05). A surface regression response model was developed that account for 64% of spatial and interannual yield variance, but this model could not perform a better yield prediction than the blind guess technique. An ANN was fitted to the data that accounted for 76% of yield variability. Comparing predicted versus observed yield a lower RMSE (P = 0.05) was obtained using the ANN than using the regression or the blind guess methods. Regional production estimations performed by the ANN showed a good agreement with observed data with a RMSE equivalent to 7% of the whole surveyed area production. As variables used for the ANN development may be available around 40-60 days before wheat harvest, the methodology may be used for wheat production forecasting in the Pampas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The model used daily rainfall and mean temperature to predict aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) buildup in each locality before the commencement of the cereal-growing season in late autumn, and to forecast the timing of aphid immigration into crops. The introduction of BYDV by aphid immigrants, aphid buildup within the crop, spread of BYDV, and yield losses were predicted for different sowing dates. The model simulations were validated with 10 years' field data from five different sites in the grainbelt, representing a wide range of scenarios. When first aphid arrival dates ranging from 1 June to 2 September were compared with predictions, 65% of the variation between sites and years was explained. Progress curves for the predicted percentage of plants infected with the serotype BYDV-PAV closely resembled the starting point and shape of those recorded in 14 out of 18 scenarios. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the combination of a high proportion of immigrants vectoring BYDV, early sowing of crops and early start to aphid arrival relative to sowing date led to the most BYDV spread and greatest yield loss. The model was incorporated into a decision support system used by farmers in targeting sprays against aphids to prevent virus spread in autumn and winter. BYDV PREDICTOR could serve as a template for modelling similar virus/aphid vector pathosystems in other regions of the world, especially those with Mediterranean-type climates.",,,,"Diggle, Art J/C-5057-2013; Thackray, Deborah/V-8765-2019; Jones, Roger A.C./B-1200-2011","Thackray, Deborah/0000-0002-8229-6372; Jones, Roger A.C./0000-0003-3593-3102",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLANT PATHOL,Plant Pathol.,FEB,2009,58,1,,,,,186,202,,10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01950.x,,,,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,,,WOS:000262487200021,,,,,

Hence, routine monitoring and quality assessment is a necessary practice for effective environmental management. However, the definition of techniques and criteria for monitoring is not a trivial task: identification of new indices of environmental quality is a hot research topic in the field of applied ecology. Some critical issues of ecological quality assessment are represented by the different sources of uncertainty involved in the measurement, modelling and classification processes. Measurements of environmental variables are often imprecise due to natural variability and background noise; interactions between single variables are complex, as is the behaviour of natural ecosystems. Moreover, the translation of quantitative measurements into quality classes requires a subjective classification: the definition of threshold values of acceptability depends on the personal knowledge of the scientist who designs the model. The management of all of these potential sources of uncertainty requires suitable instruments. Fuzzy logic represents an effective technique for coping with such problems, as it allows the use of information that other methods cannot include, such as individual knowledge and experience, to combine quantitative and qualitative data in modeling ecological complexity. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical formalism that translates expert judgment expressed in linguistic terms into precise numbers, so the laws of fuzziness are scientifically sound; at the same time, it allows avoidance of artificial precision and producing results that are more similar to the real world. For all of these reasons, since the middle 1990s fuzzy indices of ecological conditions have been proposed and tested in air, water and soil environments. Fuzzy techniques have been applied at different stages of the assessment process, as the coding of species' biological traits, the processing of qualitative data, the definition of ecological rules, and the multicriteria evaluation of ecosystems. The objective of this chapter is to review the most relevant fuzzy techniques applied to the ecological quality assessment, providing a rational classification of such techniques, in order to allow a qualitative comparison of the considered approaches. Moreover, this chapter aims to highlight the most promising applications of fuzzy logic to ecological research in order to show the benefits of fuzzy-based approaches when coping with the high complexity of ecosystems.",,,,"Marchini, Agnese/J-9256-2012","Marchini, Agnese/0000-0003-4580-0522",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,115,172,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",,,WOS:000279761800006,,,,,

Decision theory should offer managers guidance to formulate the optimal allocation of resources. Unfortunately, current decision theory models typically do not consider invasion dynamics and do not make full use of the best models of biological spread and best biological data from theoretical models. We developed a decision theory model that integrated population dynamics, spread, uncertainty, and changes in management policies. We applied this model to leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), a high-priority invasive weed in North America. We used field data to construct a biological model that included stochastic population dynamics and spatial spread and integrated it with decision theory using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). The SDP model considered three control strategies: no control, biological control, and herbicide control. Solutions from the SDP model determined the optimal strategy to apply at a given state for any time horizon. The optimal strategy depended on the area and density of leafy spurge and varied with the time horizon; therefore, dynamic control is important in management programs. Biological control was consistently indicated as the optimal strategy for all time horizons. Herbicide control was the optimal strategy for small areas with high-density infestation for long time horizons. We conclude that dynamic control, forecasting, and the time horizon are important considerations for invasive species managers who are under financial, logistical, and time constraints.",,,,"Hyder, Ayaz/A-3738-2016","Hyder, Ayaz/0000-0003-4865-6482",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Most forecasts are based on climate envelopes (CE), correlative approaches that project future distributions on the basis of the current climate often assuming some dispersal lag. One major caveat with this approach is that it ignores the complexity of factors other than climate that contribute to a species' distributional range. To overcome this limitation and to complement predictions based on CE modeling we carried out a transplant experiment of resident and potential-migrant species. Tree seedlings of 18 species were planted side by side from 2001 to 2004 at several locations in the Southern Appalachians and in the North Carolina Piedmont (USA). Growing seedlings under a large array of environmental conditions, including those forecasted for the next decades, allowed us to model seedling survival as a function of variables characteristic of each site, and from here we were able to make predictions on future seedling recruitment. In general, almost all species showed decreased survival in plots and years with lower soil moisture, including both residents and potential migrants, and in both locations, the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont. The detrimental effects that anticipated arid conditions could have on seedling recruitment contradict some of the projections made by CE modeling, where many of the species tested are expected to increase in abundance or to expand their ranges. These results point out the importance of evaluating the potential sources of migrant species when modeling vegetation response to climate change, and considering that species adapted to the new climate and the local conditions may not be available in the surrounding regions.",,,,"Clark, James S./G-6331-2011; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

As part of the management process, it is important to assess the baseline characteristics of the marine environment so that sustainable development can be pursued. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict and forecast quantitative characteristics of water bodies. The true power and advantage of this method lie in its ability to (1) represent both linear and non-linear relationships and (2) learn these relationships directly from the data being modeled. The study focuses on Singapore coastal waters. The ANN model is built for quick assessment and forecasting of selected water quality variables at any location in the domain of interest. Respective variables measured at other locations serve as the input parameters. The variables of interest are salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a. A time lag up to 2 Delta t appeared to suffice to yield good simulation results. To validate the performance of the trained ANN, it was applied to an unseen data set from a station in the region. The results show the ANN's great potential to simulate water quality variables. Simulation accuracy, measured in the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (R-2), ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 for the training and overfitting test data. Thus, a trained ANN model may potentially provide simulated values for desired locations at which measured data are unavailable yet required for water quality models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A combination of bottom-up and top-down eutrophication control measures has been implemented in both lakes since 1979. Dividing the time-series data into training and validation datasets based on three distinctive management periods has facilitated a comparative analysis of the two lakes regarding the long-term dynamics in response to eutrophication control. Results of the study have demonstrated that RANN and HEA can be applied for (1) 5-day-ahead prediction of Oscillatoria spp. and (2) 5-day-ahead prediction of Scenedesmus spp. Firstly RANN achieved reasonably accurate results for 5-day-ahead forecasting of abundances of blue-green algae Oscillatoria and green algae Scenedesmus in both lakes. Secondly HEA achieved similar good forecasting results and also provided model representations for both algae species in the form of rule sets. The limitation with single lake models is that the rule sets discovered are lake specific. Merging of the two lake datasets using merged lake models for both training and testing have produced simpler and generic rule sets that explain the dynamics of Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus for both lakes. The results from this study have shown that both external nutrient control combined with food web manipulation have turned the lakes from hypereutrophic conditions and from Oscillatoria to Scenedesmus dominance. These complex dynamics that are associated with the shift from periods of turbid with Oscillatoria dominance to clear-water conditions with increased Scenedesmus in both lakes are predictable and can be explained by the key-driving variables in the generic rule sets discovered.

In recent years, a large quantity of ecological data has been globally accumulated in habitats monitored by Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), and that data enabled ecologists to apply non-linear data-driven ecological modelling algorithms to their systems. Numerous studies have reported that empirical modelling algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were superior to conventional models in applicability, especially for systems where underlying ecological relationship was not fully understood. However, in order to process sufficient information from the target ecosystem or entity, the size of empirical models tended to become larger by applying diverse state variables or forcing functions to the models. Despite the fact that the developed models empirically had accurate performance in prediction or classification of target data, they are occasionally not free from complex structures (e.g., large number of input variables). The TARNN algorithm used in this study can be an alternative solution to overcome the increasing size and structural complexity of the models, based on model performance, which is hardly found in freshwater ecology. In this study, the performance of TARNN for freshwater ecological data was evaluated by being applied to two types of data sets of phytoplankton dynamics. The first data encompassed intensive seasonality (monthly averaged biovolume of Stephanodiscus hantzschii) which proliferated and dominated the algal assemblage (ca. 90%) annually in the lower Nakdong River during winters. The other data was daily sampled phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in which significant seasonality did not reside. The predictability of two TARNN models was compared with appropriate statistical models, i.e., data with seasonality was modelled by Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the other data with Simple Exponential Smoothing. In both cases of data sets, the TARNN models outperformed the statistical methods in accuracy of prediction (TARNN, r(2) > 0.9 for both seasonal and non-seasonal testing data sets; both statistical models, r(2) < 0.3 for the testing data sets). Especially, the capacity of prediction using the TARNN algorithm was not decreased by the absence of seasonality. Through the presented results, it can be assumed that TARNN can process non-linear autoregressive analysis successfully for ecological data. The development of non-linear autoregressive models for phytoplankton prediction can suggest more efficient direction for water quality management approaches of freshwater systems with long-term database. A real-time forecasting system for algal proliferation, one of the state-of-the-art predicting systems, can be identified using the linkage between the modelling technique and telemetry.

However, these works still have some limitations in topology design of their networks, it is because the networks' topology fails to embody important characteristics of aquatic ecosystem that the effectiveness of their models seems remain to be improved.

The simulation result demonstrates the satisfying performance of BP networks in eutrophication modeling. Meanwhile, comparing three kinds of network topology with each other, this paper further proves that, by way of dividing factors into press and response ones to define inputs and outputs respectively and building up feedback routs between inputs and outputs, the performance of BP networks to simulate eutrophication could be improved effectively.

Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species' range shifts, changes in phenology and species' extinctions, accurate projections of species' responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species' responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species' distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the ""trailing edge"" of shifting populations, species' interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes A occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species' distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species' migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species' distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

An ecological model was developed using genetic programming (GP) to predict the time-series dynamics of the diatom, Stephanodiscus hantzschii for the lower Nakdong River, South Korea. Eight years of weekly data showed the river to be hypertrophic (chl. a, 45.1 +/- 4.19 mu g L-1, mean +/- SE, n = 427), and S. hantzschii annually formed blooms during the winter to spring flow period (late November to March). 2. A simple non-linear equation was created to produce a 3-day sequential forecast of the species biovolume, by means of time series optimization genetic programming (TSOGP). Training data were used in conjunction with a GP algorithm utilizing 7 years of limnological variables (1995-2001). The model was validated by comparing its output with measurements for a specific year with severe blooms (1994). The model accurately predicted timing of the blooms although it slightly underestimated biovolume (training r(2) = 0.70, test r(2) = 0.78). The model consisted of the following variables: dam discharge and storage, water temperature, Secchi transparency, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, evaporation and silica concentration. 3. The application of a five-way cross-validation test suggested that GP was capable of developing models whose input variables were similar, although the data are randomly used for training. The similarity of input variable selection was approximately 51% between the best model and the top 20 candidate models out of 150 in total (based on both Root Mean Squared Error and the determination coefficients for the test data). 4. Genetic programming was able to determine the ecological importance of different environmental variables affecting the diatoms. A series of sensitivity analyses showed that water temperature was the most sensitive parameter. In addition, the optimal equation was sensitive to DO, Secchi transparency, dam discharge and silica concentration. The analyses thus identified likely causes of the proliferation of diatoms in 'river-reservoir hybrids' (i.e. rivers which have the characteristics of a reservoir during the dry season). This result provides specific information about the bloom of S. hantzschii in river systems, as well as the applicability of inductive methods, such as evolutionary computation to river-reservoir hybrid systems.",,,,"Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/O-6355-2014","Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/0000-0001-7721-4937",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Overland dispersal into inland lakes and reservoirs, however, has occurred at a much slower rate than earlier spread via connected, navigable waterways. We forecasted the potential western spread of zebra mussels by predicting the overland movement of recreational boaters with a production-constrained gravity model. We also predicted the potential abundance of zebra mussels in two western reservoirs by comparing their water chemistry characteristics with those of water bodies with known abundances of zebra mussels. Most boats coming from waters infested with zebra mussels were taken to areas that already had zebra mussels, buta small proportion of such boats did travel west of the 100th meridian. If zebra mussels do establish in western US. water bodies, we predict that population densities could achieve similar levels to those in the Midwestern United States, where zebra mussels have caused considerable economic and ecological impacts. Our analyses suggest that the dispersal of zebra mussels to the western United States is an event of low probability but potentially high impact on native biodiversity and human infrastructure. Combining these results with economic analyses could help determine appropriate investment levels in prevention and control strategies.",,,,"Bossenbroek, Jonathan/C-9184-2012; Bossenbroek, Jonathan/F-3664-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

The results have improved understanding of relationships between changing microcystin concentrations, Microcystis species abundances and annual rainfall intensity. The data analysis by non-supervised ANN revealed that total Microcystis abundance and extra-cellular microcystin concentrations in typical dry years are much higher than those in typical wet years. It also showed that high microcystin concentrations in dry years coincided with the dominance of the toxic Microcystis Viridis whilst in typical wet years non-toxic Microcystis ichthyoblabe were dominant. Hybrid EA were used to discover rule sets to explain and forecast the occurrence of high microcystin concentrations in relation to water quality and climate conditions. The results facilitated early warning by 3-days-ahead forecasting of microcystin concentrations based on limnological and meteorological input data, achieving an r(2) = 0.74 for testing.

The use of simulation models in pest management started with the development of single-species population dynamics models in the late 1960s. Later, population dynamics models for bitrophic interactions between pests and natural enemies were devised. Crop growth simulation models were coupled with pest damage mechanisms in the mid-80s, but the approach was described as a one-way analysis of crop-pest interactions because these models accounted for pest effects on crop growth without the reverse being considered. A two-way approach for crop-pest interactions came into being with the interlinking of pest population dynamics models with crop growth simulation models in the 1990s. Pest management research is required to produce practical tools for developing tactics and strategies for pest management. Simulation models help to produce such tools and decision models. They are used for various applications, such as rationalizing pesticide use, pest risk analysis, pest zonation, analysis of climate change impact on pests, and assessing the effect of transgenic crops on the environment.

Understanding the mechanism and providing accurate prediction of ABs' formation and occurrence is of foremost importance in relation to the protection of sensitive marine resources. In this paper, a multivariate time series model, namely the vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) and the long memory filter is proposed to model and predict ABs. To evaluate the effectiveness of this VARX model, both daily and 2-h field monitoring data of chlorophyll fluorescence (CHL), dissolved oxygen (DO), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), water temperature (TEMP), solar radiation (SR) and wind speed (WS) obtained at Kat O, Hong Kong, between February 2000 and March 2003 were employed. Unlike the other data driven approaches, this VARX model not only provides more interpretable effects of specific lags of environmental factors, but also sheds light on the feedback effects of AB on these variables. In general, daily CHL measurements up to 4 days can provide crucial information for predicting algal dynamics, while the VARX model is able to explicitly reveal ecological relationships between CHL and other environmental factors. In addition, the application of long-memory filter can further extract patterns of seasonal variations which is thought to be correspondent to the variation of algal species in Hong Kong water. With a view to providing an early warning signal of AB to fishermen and regulatory authorities, an alarming system was developed based on the VARX model; it could achieve 83% correct prediction of AB occurrences with a lead time of 2.5 days. Concerning the forecast performance of the VARX model, daily forecasting performance is comparatively better than that of artificial neural network models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study assessed the applicability of the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) forage growth model for both strategic (long-term) and tactical (within-season) prediction of forage production in northern mixed-grass prairie. An improved version of the model was calibrated for conditions at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Long-term (1983-2001) simulations of peak standing crop (PSC) were compared to observations. Also, within-season (1983) forecasts of total aboveground biomass made for 1. March onward, 1 April onward, 1 May onward, and 1 June onward were compared to observations. The normal, driest, and wettest weather years on record (1915-1981) were used to simulate expected values, lower bounds, and upper bounds of biomass production, respectively. The forage model explained 66% of the variability in PSC from 1983 to 2001. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) derived from long-term simulated PSC overestimates cumulative probabilities for PSC > 1 500 kg.ha(-1). The generated CDF could be used strategically to estimate long-term forage production at various levels of probability, with errors in cumulative probability ranging from 0.0 to 0.16. Within-season forecasts explained 77%-94% of biomass variability in 1983. It was shown that monthly updating of the forage forecast, with input of actual weather to date, improves accuracy.

Conventionally, computer-based models use a mathematical formulation for the processes involved which are then solved by numerical methods. These models are often derived based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity and conservation principles of mass, momentum and energy. Development of these models often demands a clear understanding of the processes involved. However, the above assumptions are easily violated when spatial heterogeneity, individual species behaviour and local interactions play a significant role in the system dynamics. In particular for eco-environmental systems, knowledge on local interactions that determine the overall system behaviour is not always available. Although the rapid advances of data-driven techniques have recently made great contributions to water-environment related research, data on ecosystems are often quite limited, which restricts the application of data mining methods to eco-environmental system modelling. In addition, no modelling - also not black-box modelling - can be undertaken without having at least some understanding of the basic processes and mechanisms involved. It is always advisable to start exploring any dataset using conventional statistical techniques, as elaborated in this paper for a case study on Western Xiamen Bay, China. Neural network trimming was then used to establish the dominant factors; it was shown that a relatively simple ANN model was quite capable of capturing the essential features, provided the right input parameters are chosen. Examples of integrated approaches to ecohydraulics modelling coupling formulations with cellular automata and physical equations with fuzzy rules are presented for applications on eutrophication modelling of Taihu Lake in China, competitive growths and colonization of two underwater macrophytes in Lake Veluwe in The Netherlands, and forecasting of algal blooms in the Dutch coastal waters on the North Sea. A mussel dynamics model developed for the Upper Mississippi River in the USA demonstrates the feasibility of individual based modelling in ecosystem dynamics. Numerical models are quite capable of simulating the abiotic aquatic environment, including complicated fluid flow and transport mechanisms. However, when it comes to simulating the biotic and ecosystem dynamics, the interaction of individual species with their environment, as well as the interactions amongst species, has to be taken into account. The future of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental modelling thus seems to lie in the integration of different paradigms and techniques, which is the core content of the hydroinformatics discipline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

One of the most common problems is sparse data: we will have rarely sampled all areas for invaders and consequently do not know where all the invaded sites are. This is problematic because the entire system of sites determines invasion probability for any single site-unsampled sites can act as both sources and sinks of propagules. Thus, the difficulty is to predict invasions across the entire system with only sparse data. In this manuscript, we develop an approach to make use of partial data to forecast new invasions, and compare it with default ways of handling missing information in biological invasions. We demonstrate that it is possible to estimate spread with only a fraction of sites sampled. We find that reliability depends on the number of invaded sites sampled and that there is a tendency to underestimate the effect of propagule pressure when Allee effects are present.

LEP.; BALSAM FIR,"Wine production is an important industry in Western Switzerland, but vineyards must contend with grape vine and grape berry moths, the larval stages of which feed on grape flower buds and berries. This paper proposes a stochastic model for prediction of the emergence times of the moths, in order to aid treatment aimed at their control. Observed moth counts are treated as a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose probabilities are related to the distribution of time to emergence. We use a hierarchical model to account for the variability of this distribution between sites and years. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian fitting of the model to data are described, the latter using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, and the Bayesian approach is used for forecasting in future years. Grape vine moth flights proved much more variable than grape berry moth flights among sites and years; depending on the site, the flights of the two species can overlap or be completely distinct. Credibility intervals are provided for each site for a random future year, and the predictions can be updated and refined once 15-20% of the flight for a new year has emerged. The paper ends with discussion of the role of such models in similar applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Chl a varied seasonally and along a saline gradient throughout the Neuse River (North Carolina). NEP was extremely dynamic in the Trout River (Florida), with phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions occurring over short-term intervals. Physical and chemical variables, arising from meteorological and hydrological conditions, created spatial and/or temporal gradients in both systems and served as interacting predictors for the trends/patterns of Chi a and NEP. ANNs outperformed comparable linear regression models and reliably modeled Chi a concentrations less than 20 mu g L-1 and NEP values, denoting the apparent non-linear interactions among abiotic and indicator variables. ANNs underestimated Chi a concentrations greater than 20 mu g L-1, likely due to the periodicity of data acquisition not being sufficient to generalize system variability, the designated 'lag' effect for variables not being adequate to portray estuarine flow dynamics, the exclusion of (one or more) variables that would have improved prediction, and/or an unrealistic expectation of network performance. Variables indicative of meteorological and hydrological forcing and/or proxy measurements of phytoplankton had the greatest relative impact on prediction of Chl a and NEP. Except for their predictive capability, ANNs might appear to be of limited value for ecological applications and problem solving; interpreting the absolute impact of and/or interacting relationships among network variables is intrinsically difficult. Statistical methods or 'rule extraction' algorithms that convey comprehensible network interpretation are needed prior to the routine use of ANNs in programs assessing and/or forecasting the response of biotic indicators to perturbation or for a means to discern estuarine function.

Stream flow is estimated from stream stage, width, cross-sectional area, and mean velocity at the gaging station. Since measurement of mean velocity is time-consuming, expensive, and dangerous during high flows, alternative methods of flow forecasting are needed. Traditionally, hydrologists use rating curves for flow estimates. The United States Geological Survey has been estimating stream discharge using conventional rating curves for Hawaii streams. The rating curves are developed from records of measured stream stage and discharge. Clearly, the rating curves are set up for cases in which stream stage is the only input and discharge is the output. However, major limitations of using a rating curve are that the effects of hysteresis (i.e. loop-rating) are not taken into account, and as a result the prediction accuracy is lost when the stream changes its flow behavior. As an alternative method, artificial neural networks are proposed. The performances of artificial neural networks are examined for two input data sets: one set with and the other set without mean velocity, but both including stream stage, width, and cross-sectional area for two gaging stations on the stream. The results show that for both input data sets, well-optimized neural networks can outperform rating curves for discharge forecasting. Additionally, it is worth noting that neural networks are capable of predicting the loop-rating curve, which is impossible to predict using conventional rating curves. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The different predicted abilities of the two methods in Liuhai lakes were compared. A principle analysis method was first used to select the input variables of the models to avoid the phenomenon of collinearity in the data. The results showed that the input variables for the artificial neural networks were T, TP, transparency(SD), DO, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), pH and the output variable was Chl-a. A three layer Levenberg-Marguardt feed forward learning algorithm in ANN was used to model the eutrophication process of Liuhai lakes. 20 nodes in hidden layer and I node of output for the ANN model had been optimized by trial and error method. A sensitivity analysis of the input variables was performed to evaluate their relative significance in determining the predicted values. The correlation coefficient between predicted value and observed value in all data and in test data were 0.717 and 0.816 respectively in the artificial neural networks. The stepwise regression method was used to simulate the linear relation between Chl-a and temperature, of which the correlation coefficient was 0.213. By comparing the results of the two models, it was found that neural network models were able to simulate non-linear behavior in the water eutrophication process of Liuhai lakes reasonably and could successfully estimate some extreme values from calibration and test data sets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J ENVIRON SCI-CHINA,J.

However, regional crop growth simulation faces the difficulties in determining the spatial distribution of some model parameters and initial conditions. In this study, regional biomasses at turn-green stage of winter wheat were re-estimated by linking WOFOST model and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) synthesized from remote sensing data. Moreover, we proposed a way of combining evapotranspiration derived from satellite remote sensing data to crop grow simulation model. Thus, the regional initial available soil water and irrigation at earring stage were re-initialized and re-estimated by using remote sensing data. Those methods were well applied to simulate the growth and development for winter wheat at local site. After regionalizing of weather data, crop model parameters and initial conditions, those methods were used to estimate winter wheat yields in North China during the growing season from 2001 to 2002 at the scale of 0.25 degrees. The results showed that both soil water and final winter wheat yields estimation were improved and the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) decreased from 0.63 without remote sensing data to 0.20 with remote sensing data for 32 sites. The relative errors of the aggregated yields for three provinces were -4.9%, 4.3% and 8.6%, respectively.

Fuzzy logic approach is one of these methods that can be used for forecasting purposes and identification of complex systems. In this study, it is aimed to model monthly dissolved oxygen (DO) amount variations. Firstly, regression technique is used to remove the trend from the actual dissolved oxygen time series. Detrended time series is then modeled with Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy logic approach. The monthly historical records of DO as considered in this paper provide a fundamental data exhibiting persistence. It is this dependence that gives opportunity for the serial modeling of the data sequence concerned. These models are the prime and sole means to derive the future likely excedences over the historical values and hence provide a chance for the future planner with decision variables such as the minimum DO amounts and their persistence for some duration. In the scope of this study, DO concentration changes in the two stations located in Golden Horn at the 0.5 m (upper layer) depth were modeled. As a result of the study, it is seen that one can forecast the next month's DO amount from antecedent measurements within an acceptable relative error limits. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The future response of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to a changing environment and continued anthropogenic disturbance is of particular interest to the public because of their high economic, social, and cultural value. While numerous retrospective analyses show a strong correlation between past changes in the ocean environment and salmon production within the north Pacific, these correlations rarely make good predictions. Using a Bayesian time-series model to make successive 1-yr-ahead forecasts, we predicted changes in the ocean survival of Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) from indices of coastal ocean upwelling with a high degree of certainty (R-2 = 0.71). Furthermore, another form of the dynamic times-series model that used all of the available data indicated an even stronger coupling between smolt-to-adult survival and ocean upwelling in the spring and fall (R-2 = 0.96).

These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have led to massive fish kills, hypoxia, and beach closures. However, to date the causality and mechanism of coastal algal blooms are still poorly understood. A remotely controlled autonomous real time field monitoring system has been developed to continuously track the changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, dissolved oxygen and other hydro-meteorological variables at two representative mariculture zones. The system can give an alarm when a bloom is detected, so that timely manual water quality sampling can be carried out to supplement the telemetric data. During 2000-2003, the system has successfully tracked 19 algal blooms. In the shallow weakly flushed coastal water (depth 7-10 m, tidal current 5-19 cm s(-1)), the bloom is short-lived, typically lasting a few days to over a week, with chlorophyll and DO concentrations in the range of 20-40 mg m(-3) and 2-15 g m(-3), respectively. It is found that: (1) the chlorophyll concentration is strongly correlated with its past values in the previous week, suggesting an auto-regressive type of algal dynamics; (2) the dissolved oxygen can reach highly super-saturated levels (12 g m(-3)) during a diatom bloom, and decreases to below 4 g m(-3) at the tail of the growth phase; (3) in contrast, a dinoflagellate bloom is characterized by a much more pronounced vertical structure. Diel vertical migration and aggregation to dense layers are clearly observed. Significant dissolved oxygen consumption is associated with the migration, resulting in DO drops by as much as 6 g m(-3) during the bloom; (4) the predominance of diatoms and dinoflagellates at the two sites can be explained in terms of the different hydrographic and nutrient conditions (the N:P ratio). Net algal growth rate, sinking and swimming velocities are derived from the in situ bloom data. The 4-year high frequency data set provides a basis for development of models for forecast of harmful algal blooms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, an important step in the ANN modelling methodology that has received little attention is the selection of appropriate model inputs. This article is the first in a two-part series published in this issue and addresses the lack of a suitable input determintion methodology for ANN models in water resources applications. The current state of input determination is reviewed and two input determination methodologies are presented. The first method is a model-free approach, which utilises a measure of the mutual information criterion to characterise the dependence between a potential model input and the output variable. To facilitate the calculation of dependence in the case of multiple inputs, a partial measure of the mutual information criterion is us In the second method, a self-organizing map (SOM) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and obtain independent inputs. To determine which inputs have a significant relationship with the output (dependent) variable. a hybrid genetic algorithm and general regression neural network (GAGRNN) is used. Both input determination techniques are tested on a number of synthetic data sets. where the dependence attributes were known a priori.

These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.",,,,"Scheuerell, Mark/N-6683-2016","Scheuerell, Mark/0000-0002-8284-1254",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2005,86,1,,,,,198,209,,10.1890/03-0408,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000226791700020,,,,,

Several studies have shown that climate changes over the latter part of the 20th century affected the phenology and population dynamics of single species. However, the key limitation to forecasting the effects of changing climate on ecosystems lies in understanding how it will affect interactions among species. We investigated the effects of climatic and biotic drivers on physical and biological lake processes, using a historical dataset of 40 years from Lake Washington, USA, and dynamic time-series models to explain changes in the phenological patterns among physical and biological components of pelagic ecosystems. Long-term climate warming and variability because of large-scale climatic patterns like Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) extended the duration of the stratification period by 25 days over the last 40 years. This change was due mainly to earlier spring stratification (16 days) and less to later stratification termination in fall (9 days). The phytoplankton spring bloom advanced roughly in parallel to stratification onset and in 2002 it occurred about 19 days earlier than it did in 1962, indicating the tight connection of spring phytoplankton growth to turbulent conditions. In contrast, the timing of the clear-water phase showed high variability and was mainly driven by biotic factors. Among the zooplankton species, the timing of spring peaks in the rotifer Keratella advanced strongly, whereas Leptodiaptomus and Daphnia showed slight or no changes. These changes have generated a growing time lag between the spring phytoplankton peak and zooplankton peak, which can be especially critical for the cladoceran Daphnia. Water temperature, PDO, and food availability affected the timing of the spring peak in zooplankton. Overall, the impact of PDO on the phenological processes were stronger compared with ENSO. Our results highlight that climate affects physical and biological processes differently, which can interrupt energy flow among trophic levels, making ecosystem responses to climate change difficult to forecast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) EcoL Monogr. 62, 447-502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L.

We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts.

Most of the current models do not include differences in local stream characteristics and effects on the biota. To define the most important variables that should be used in a stream eutrophication model, the literature was reviewed. Increased nutrient concentrations can cause toxicity (by high concentrations of ammonia or nitrite), which directly affects the functioning of organisms in the ecosystem. Indirect effects take place via two main processes, primary production and decomposition which can both be stimulated by an increase of the nutrient concentrations. If there are no regulating mechanisms, a higher production rate can cause an increase in algal biomass. But often secondary production and in some cases even the number of predators also increases. This means that effects of nutrient enrichment become visible throughout the whole food web. The effects on community level are shown by changes in species composition and densities. A higher algal biomass could also cause oxygen depletion, which has a direct effect on macrofauna and fish. Important for the extent of the eutrophication effects is the amount of nutrients that is withdrawn from the water column by the ecosystem. All these mechanisms are strongly influenced by the local characteristics of the stream. That is why first of all the sensitivity of a stream to eutrophication depends on the regional stream characteristics. A model developed for a certain stream type and region is in many cases not applicable to other stream types or regions. Therefore, local stream characteristics should be included if the model should be more generally applicable. In conclusion: Stream eutrophication models should combine relationships between nutrient input, nutrient uptake versus transport, and their effects on the biotic community. It should include relationships between regional stream characteristics and the expected extent of the eutrophication effects (the sensitivity of a stream for eutrophication). Models that include all these factors are not yet available but there are many models which focus on only a part of these processes. Some of these parts can be used to fill in a complete stream eutrophication model. However, because of differences between stream types and regions these parts should first be tested for their applicability to the stream type and region of interest. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our analyses revealed that only very limited areas of Wyoming are likely to support multiyear infestations of rangeland grasshoppers. Across the state, 91% of the land has a >50% probability of a transition from infested to uninfested conditions from one year to the next. Considering only the land that has ever been infested by grasshoppers, 55% of this area was found to have a >90% probability of becoming uninfested in the year after an infestation. The life expectancy of a grasshopper infestation in Wyoming is generally <2 yr, and large portions of the state can expect infestations to persist for <1 yr. Although rangeland grasshopper infestations are unlikely to persist for >1-2 yr, uninfested conditions are also unlikely to last. Of the land that has ever been infested, uninfested conditions are expected to persist for less than or equal to10 yr on 36% of the area. Thus, rangeland grasshopper outbreaks are highly erratic events, with either infested or uninfested conditions lasting for short periods. Contrary to previous analyses at much coarser spatial scales, the probability of rangeland grasshopper infestations persisting for multiple years appears to be quite low. As such, for most of Wyoming there is little basis for prorating the benefits of control beyond the year of treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

It is seed-borne in lupin and seed-infected plants act as the primary virus source for secondary spread by aphid vectors within crops. Infection with CMV causes yield losses of up to 60% in epidemic years, but has little impact on yield in years when spread is limited. Aphids also cause sporadic yield losses due to direct feeding damage. A simulation model was developed to forecast aphid outbreaks and epidemics of CMV in lupin crops growing in the 'grainbelt' of south-west Australia, which has a Mediterranean-type climate. The model uses rainfall during summer and early autumn to calculate an index of aphid build-up on weeds, crop volunteers and self-regenerating annual pastures in each 'grainbelt' locality before the growing season commences in late autumn. The index is used to forecast the timing of aphid immigration into crops. The subsequent aphid build-up and movement within the crop, spread of CMV from virus-infected source plants within the crop, yield losses and percentage of harvested seed-infected are then calculated. The model evaluates the effects of different sowing dates, percentages of CMV infection in seed sown and plant population densities on virus spread. The model simulations were validated with 14 years' field data from six different sites in the 'grainbelt', representing a wide range of pre-growing season rainfall scenarios, sowing dates, percentages of infection in seed sown and plant population densities. The model was incorporated into a decision support system (DSS) for use by lupin farmers and agricultural consultants in planning CMV management and targeting sprays against aphids to prevent direct feeding damage. The inputs required from the user are lupin cultivar, anticipated emergence date, percentage CMV infection in seed sown, plant density and location. The output consists of a personalised risk forecast for the user and includes predictions for date of first aphid arrival, aphid numbers, CMV spread, final virus incidence, yield loss due to infection and percentage infection in harvested seed. Predictions from the DSS are accessible via an Internet site and from other information sources. The model can serve as a template for modelling similar virus/aphid vector pathosystems in other regions of the world, especially those with Mediterranean-type climates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

As an indicator of progress toward that goal, the Strategy specifies that lake trout PCBs will decline 25% from 2000 to 2007. We estimated the plausibility of achieving this near-term goal by examining a time-series of Lake Michigan lake trout PCB concentrations from 1972 to 2000. We used two different Bayesian approaches, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and dynamic linear models (DLM), to model the trajectory of these historical data and forecast concentrations through 2007. Both approaches indicate that the probability of a 25% reduction from 2000 to 2007 is negligible. The most likely lake trout PCB declines predicted by the BMA and DLM over this time period are 6.8% and 8.9%, respectively. Our results suggest that declines in lake trout PCBs will be in the range of 5-10% assuming conditions similar to recent years.

These estimates could provide insights into rates of migration in response to climate change and rates of alien invasions. LDD information is not available for parameterization of current models because it is hard to obtain. We combine a new stochastic model with a flexible framework that permits assimilation of evidence that might be derived from a range of sources. Results are consistent with the prediction of traditional diffusion that population spread has a finite asymptotic velocity. Unlike traditional diffusion, spread is not well described by the mean; it is erratic. In contrast with deterministic models, our results show that inherent uncertainty, rather than parameter sensitivity, thwarts informative forecasts of spread velocity. Analysis shows that, because LDD is inherently unpredictable, even full knowledge of LDD parameters might not provide informative estimates of velocity for populations characterized by LDD. Although predictive distributions are too broad to provide precise estimates of spread rate, they are valuable for comparing spread potential among species and for identifying potential for invasion. Using combinations of dispersal data and the estimates provided by dispersal biologists that derive from multiple sources, the model predicts spread rates that are much slower than those from traditional (deterministic) fat-tailed models and from simulation models of spread, but for different reasons. Deterministic fat-tailed models overestimate spread rate, because they assume that fractions of individuals can rapidly occupy distant sites. Stochastic models recognize that distant colonization is limited to discrete individuals. Stochastic simulations of plant migration overestimate migration of trees, because they typically assume values of R-0 that are too large.",,,,"Clark, James S./G-6331-2011; Lewis, Mark A/C-5015-2008; Lewis, Mark/A-2659-2014","Lewis, Mark A/0000-0002-7155-7426; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2003,84,8,,,,,1979,1988,,10.1890/01-0618,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000185073100005,,,,,

The commonly used back-propagation learning algorithm is employed for training the ANN. The modeling is based on (a) comprehensive biweekly water quality data at Tolo Harbour (1982-2000); and (b) 4-year set of weekly phytoplankton abundance data at Lamina Island (1996-2000). Algal biomass is represented as chlorophyll-a and cell concentration of Skeletonema at the two locations, respectively. Analysis of a large number of scenarios shows that the best agreement with observations is obtained by using merely the time-lagged algal dynamics as the network input. In contrast to previous findings with more complicated neural networks of algal blooms in freshwater systems, the present work suggests the algal concentration in the eutrophic sub-tropical coastal water is mainly dependent on the antecedent algal concentrations in the previous 1-2 weeks. This finding is also supported by an interpretation of the neural networks' weights. Through a systematic analysis of network performance, it is shown that previous reports of predictability of algal dynamics by ANN are erroneous in that 'future data' have been used to drive the network prediction. In addition, a novel real time forecast of coastal algal blooms based on weekly data at Lamina is presented. Our study shows that an ANN model with a small number of input variables is able to capture trends of algal dynamics, but data with a minimum sampling interval of 1 week is necessary. However, the sufficiency of the weekly sampling for real time predictions using ANN models needs to be further evaluated against longer weekly data sets as they become available.

Eutrophication is an example of a problem for which ecologists created fundamental understanding, predictive capability, and new options for management. Ecologists frequently justify their research funding through appeals to improved predictability. This goal is sometimes attainable and in any case motivates a considerable body of insightful research.

In most instances, multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm have been used. The major shortcoming of this approach is that the knowledge contained in the trained networks is difficult to interpret. One way to increase model transparency is to use neurofuzzy approaches, which enable the information that is stored in trained networks to be expressed in the form of a fuzzy rule base. In this paper, B-spline associative memory networks (AMNs), which have been shown to be learning equivalent to certain types of fuzzy models, are used to forecast concentrations of the cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia, 4 weeks in advance. The ASMOD (adaptive spline modeling of observation data) algorithm is used to optimise the model structure and the number of model inputs. The sensitivity of the model to the order of the basis functions and a number of stopping criteria is investigated. The performance of the various models is assessed in terms of forecasting accuracy and model transparency, and compared with that of a MLP model developed in a previous study. It is found that lower order basis functions and Bayes' Information Criterion (BIC) give the best model performance, both in terms of forecasting accuracy and transparency. The accuracy of the forecasts obtained using the B-spline AMN and MLP models is comparable, although the AMN may be considered to perform marginally better overall. In addition, the AMN provides more explicit information about the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. The fuzzy rules obtained from the AMN model suggest that incidences of Anabaena spp. generally occur after the passing of a flood hydrograph and when water temperatures are high.

They have already been successfully used to model salinity, nutrient concentrations, air pollution, and algal growth. These successes, coupled with their suitability for modelling complex systems, have resulted in an increase in their popularity and their application in an ever increasing number of areas. They are generally treated as black box models that are able to capture underlying relationships when presented with input and output data. In many instances, little consideration is given to potential input data and the internal workings of ANNs. This can result in inferior model performance and an inability to accurately compare the performance of different ANN models. Back-propagation networks employ a modelling philosophy that is similar to that of statistical methods in the sense that unknown model parameters (i.e., connection weights) are adjusted in order to obtain the best match between a historical set of model inputs and corresponding outputs. Consequently, the principles that are considered good practice in the development of statistical models should be considered. In this paper, a systematic approach to the development of ANN based forecasting models is presented, which is intended to act as a guide for potential and current users of feedforward ANNs that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm. Issues that need to be considered in the model development phase are discussed and ways of addressing them presented. The major areas covered include data transformation, the determination of appropriate model inputs, the determination of an appropriate network geometry, the optimisation of connection weights, and validation of model performance.

The performance of both model types is compared in terms of prediction accuracy and model transparency for a particular water quality case study, the forecasting (4 weeks in advance) of concentrations of the cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia. The forecasts obtained using both model types are good. Neither model clearly outperforms the other, although the forecasts obtained when the B-spline AMN model is used may be considered slightly better overall. In addition, the B-spline AMN model provides more explicit information about the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. The fuzzy rules extracted from the B-spline AMN model indicate that incidences of Anabaena spp, are likely to occur after the passing of a flood hydrograph and when water temperatures are high.",,,,"Maier, Holger R/B-9639-2008","Maier, Holger R/0000-0002-0277-6887; Sayed, Tarek/0000-0001-8797-0541",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

The evidence shows how successes in IPM have depended upon classical experimental approaches continually responding to changing constraints and to novel discoveries, which are being applied increasingly efficiently and intelligently to farm practice. Future developments are discussed in the context of past experience and new technologies. Recent developments of important new approaches that could help revolutionize management of some pest complexes, in particular genetic engineering, semiochemicals and bioinsecticides, are discussed. Much attention has been devoted to strategic modelling in the IPM context which aims to provide novel insights, but there is little evidence of its value to practical IPM; instead it could be used unwisely to encourage accumulation of unnecessary information. In contrast, tactical models are proving increasingly valuable in forecasting the need for and timing of applied controls. Whilst there have been some outstanding developments in practical application of IPM in many developed countries where the ultimate goal is to decrease over-reliance on conventional insecticides, evidence shows that in many developing countries, where the goal is an ecologically sound mix of non-chemical and chemical methods, there remains a crucial need for much more appropriate research and implementation, especially in small farm conditions.

In this paper, the steps that should be followed in the development of such models are outlined. These include the choice of performance criteria, the division and pre-processing of the available data, the determination of appropriate model inputs and network architecture, optimisation of the connection weights (training) and model validation. The options available to modellers at each of these steps are discussed and the issues that should be considered are highlighted. A review of 43 papers dealing with the use of neural network models for the prediction and forecasting of water resources variables is undertaken in terms of the modelling process adopted. In all but two of the papers reviewed, feedforward networks are used. The vast majority of these networks are trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Issues in relation to the optimal division of the available data, data pre-processing and the choice of appropriate model inputs are seldom considered. In addition, the process of choosing appropriate stopping criteria and optimising network geometry and internal network parameters is generally described poorly or carried out inadequately. All of the above factors can result in non-optimal model performance and an inability to draw meaningful comparisons between different models. Future research efforts should be directed towards the development of guidelines which assist with the development of ANN models and the choice of when ANNs should be used in preference to alternative approaches, the assessment of methods for extracting the knowledge that is contained in the connection weights of trained ANNs and the incorporation of uncertainty into ANN models.

Of one particular interest to crop growers is the possibility of applying crop models for real-time yield forecasting. This investigation evaluated the utility of the SUCROS model for site-specific real-time crop biomass and grain yield forecasting. A stochastic forecasting approach was used combining generated weather data with observed data for model updating. The forecast procedure was tested with field data collected at four sites in the UK over two growing seasons. The results showed that across all site-years, the model is able to forecast the final biomass and grain yield with <10% bias. There was no significant difference between observed and forecasted biomass and grain yield for forecasts made at anthesis or milky grain stage although earlier forecasts did show significant differences. The ranking of the observed and forecast biomass and grain yield were also highly correlated for the later forecasts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We evaluated four fragmented-data techniques for Box-Jenkins models using a data set of Peromyscus leucopus densities that spans 248 months and contains 15% missing data. We (1) approximated missing data using a linear interpolation between available observations (interpolation model), (2) estimated missing data according to the autocorrelation pattern identified with available data (estimation model), (3) forecasted missing data and reestimated the model until the forecasts converged using an estimation maximization algorithm (maximization model), and (4) omitted missing data during parameter estimation (omission model). We compared overall model fit using the Schwarz information criterion and outlier analysis. We found that the estimation and omission models fit the data better than the maximization model and far better than the interpolation model. In addition, the estimation model created more biologically realistic estimates of missing data than either the interpolation or maximization model.

We created a comprehensive population model to determine how density dependence (linear, nonlinear, and time-delayed) and weather affected the rate of population growth of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in an isolated woodlot. We studied this nonoutbreak, polyvoltine species using a 257-mo data set spanning 23 yr, which incorporated both detailed intra-annual and long-term dynamics, and we used this model to forecast future population size. We then evaluated whether 3-yr spans of monthly data or a 22-yr span of annual data were better able to identify the key determinants that drive population dynamics, and we identified which data type created more accurate forecasts. The 257-mo comprehensive model determined that the intra-annual cycle was caused by seasonally varying intrinsic growth rates and density dependence on a 1-2 mo scale and indicated that peak population size in one year did not affect the population in the subsequent year. Interannual variability in peak and trough density was caused by the effect of weather on monthly rate of growth with a 0-2 mo time delay, with the exception of two droughts. These droughts negatively affected the population for 9 mo; the effects were probably mediated through reduced seed crop. This model explained 81% of the variability in density. Because weather determined interannual variability in density, forecasts that did not use known weather data during the forecast period were poor. When weather data were used, forecasts were accurate within 1-3 animals (10%) of observed densities up to 8 mo in the future but were inaccurate beyond 8 mo. We found that shortterm monthly data detected more factors affecting the population and created more accurate forecasts than long-term annual data, because all factors affecting the population (except droughts) occurred on a monthly scale. The annual model did not detect any weather effects except droughts and detected annual density dependence, which represents time-delayed density dependence in polyvoltine species. We argue that this annual relationship is spurious and caused by studying this polyvoltine species on an inappropriate time scale. Our work suggests that the time scale of the analysis may affect the conclusions drawn about which types of factors determine population size and with what time lag. It also suggests that, even when population fluctuations can be explained, accurately predicting future densities may be impossible when fluctuations are driven by weather.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

In this paper, the stages observed when training a back-propagation neural network: are examined in detail for a particular case study; the forecasting of salinity in the River Murray at Murray Bridge, South Australia, 14 days in advance. Particular attention is paid to the behaviour of the network as it approaches a local minimum in the error surface. The effect of the presence of infrequent patterns in the training set on generalisation ability is investigated. The nature of the error surface in the vicinity of local minima is examined and options for optimising network performance (i.e. training speed and generalisation ability) are presented for real time forecasting situations.
