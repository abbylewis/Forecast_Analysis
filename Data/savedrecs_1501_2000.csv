Recent developments in niche mapping, and the possibility to account for spatial autocorrelation in species distributions, hold promise for the statistical approach explored here. Using species counts from a landscape-scale benthic monitoring programme in the western Dutch Wadden Sea during 19972005 in combination with sediment characteristics and tidal height as explanatory variables, we statistically derive realised niches for two bivalves, two crustaceans and three polychaetes, encompassing predators, suspension and bottom feeding functional groups. Unsurprisingly, realized niches varied considerably between species. Intraspecific temporal variation was assessed as overlap between the year-specific niche and the overall mean niche, and this analysis revealed considerable variation between years. The main functional groups represented by these species showed idiosyncratic and wide variability through the study period. There were no strong associations between niche characteristics and mean abundance or body size. Our assessment of intraspecific niche variability has ramifications for species distribution models in general and offers advances from previous methods. 1) By assessing species' realized niches in the multivariate environmental space, analyses are independent from the relative availability of particular environments. Predicted realized niches present differences between years, rather than annual differences in environmental conditions. 2) Using spatially explicit models to predict species habitat preferences provide more precise and unbiased estimates of speciesenvironment relationships. 3) Current niche models assume constant niches, whereas we illustrate how much these can vary over only a few generations.

Identifying items in stomachs of introduced rodents helps determine rodents' trophic positions and species most at risk of consumption. In the Hawaiian Islands, which lacked rodents prior to human arrival, three rodents (Rattus rattus or black rat, R. exulans or Pacific rat, Mus musculus or house mouse) commonly coexist in native habitats where they consume a wide range of plants and animals. These three rodent species were trapped in montane forest for 2.5 years; their stomach contents were analyzed to determine short-term diets (n = 12-95 indiv. per species), and isotopic fractions of delta N-15 and delta C-13 in their bone collagen were analyzed to further estimate their trophic positions (n = 11-20 indiv. per species). For all three species, > 75 % of individuals had plants and > 90 % had arthropods in their stomachs, and significant differences in mean relative abundances were found for food items in stomachs among all three rodents. Rodents may be dispersing some native and non-native seeds, including the highly invasive Clidemia hirta. Most identifiable arthropods in rodent stomachs were non-native, and no stomachs contained birds, snails, or lizards. The delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures were consistent with trophic feeding differences revealed from stomach contents. Dietary niche differentiation by coexisting rodent species is evident in this forest, with Pacific rats being intermediate between the mostly carnivorous house mouse and the mostly herbivorous black rat; such findings can help forecast rodent impacts and direct management efforts in ecosystems where these invasive animals coexist.",,,,,,Oahu Army Natural Resources Program; Achievement Rewards for College Scientists; Charles Lamoureux Plant Conservation Fellowship; Watson Yoshimoto Wildlife Conservation Scholarship,"Primary funding was provided by the Oahu Army Natural Resources Program; additional funding to A.B.S. was from the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (Maybell Roth Scholarship in Conservation Biology and Sarah Martin Award in Botany), the Charles Lamoureux Plant Conservation Fellowship, and the Watson Yoshimoto Wildlife Conservation Scholarship.

Therefore, correlative models should prove useful for predicting current and future spatial variation in species abundance patterns. However, this idea has not been formally tested, and the utility of such models, which have shown value for understanding the distribution of diversity elsewhere, for investigating biodiversity patterns in Antarctica remains unclear. Here we make a start at such tests by using generalized linear and simultaneous autoregressive models to demonstrate that simple environmental variables and information about the spatial structure of the environment can explain more than 90% of the variation in the abundance of Maudheimia wilsoni (Oribatida; Maudheimiidae), a representative of one of the most significant groups of Antarctic terrestrial arthropods, the mites. We show that a single environmental variable, maximum soil moisture content, can account for as much as 80% of the variance in the abundance of the mite, and that linear models with only a few environmental and spatial terms can be used to forecast the species abundance at the landscape scale. Given ongoing calls for better understanding of the distribution of Antarctic diversity and its likely future change, this initial test indicates that such modelling procedures, and more sophisticated versions thereof, hold much promise for the region and should be tested for other taxa with different life forms and habitat requirements.",,,,"le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011; Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011","le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105; Meiklejohn, Ian/0000-0001-8890-2938","British Antarctic Survey; SANAP [SNA200704200003, SNA2005061300001]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [bas0100025]",Bernard Coetzee provided useful comments on a previous version of this manuscript and Louise Coetzee provides taxonomic advice.

However, this may be due to an absence of information on impacts, including changing species occupancy and forecast occupancy, rather than lack of impact per se. Here we use the plant invaders on the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) and spatially explicit modeling of presence absence survey data to demonstrate that the geographic extent of many invasives is increasing and is forecast to lead to occupancy of >60% of the islands' surface area by 2060, with ongoing climate change. In keeping with theory, proximity to human activity, neighboring populations (i.e. propagule pressure) and residence time, along with more minor contributors such as elevation, explain >50% of the variation in the occupancy of each of the six main invasive species on the islands. Human disturbance and changing climates seem to have led to recent increases in the rate of range expansion. Our results suggest that impacts of island plant invaders may be more significant than previously estimated, largely owing to prior data deficiency. More specifically they also suggest that control plans for the PEI (and other Southern Ocean Islands, SOIS) should first target less widely distributed species, which are invasive elsewhere. They also indicate that for the other SOIS, and for Antarctica, surveillance and anticipatory control plans should be in place. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, widespread use of models is limited by the technical challenges of model-data synthesis and information management. To address these challenges, we present an ecoinformatic workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), which facilitates model analysis. Herein we describe the PEcAn modules that synthesize plant trait data to estimate model parameters, propagate parameter uncertainties through to model output, and evaluate the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty. We illustrate a comprehensive approach to the estimation of parameter values, starting with a statement of prior knowledge that is refined by species-level data using Bayesian meta-analysis; this is the first use of a rigorous meta-analysis to inform the parameters of a mechanistic ecosystem model. Parameter uncertainty is propagated using ensemble methods to estimate model uncertainty. Variance decomposition allows us to quantify the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty; this information can be used to prioritize subsequent data collection. By streamlining the use of models and focusing efforts to identify and constrain the dominant sources of uncertainty in model output, the approach used by PEcAn can speed scientific progress. We demonstrate PEcAn's ability to incorporate data to reduce uncertainty in productivity of a perennial grass monoculture (Panicum virgatum L.) modeled by the Ecosystem Demography model. Prior estimates were specified for 15 model parameters, and species-level data were available for seven of these. Meta-analysis of species-level data substantially reduced the contribution of three parameters (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate, and stomatal slope) to overall model uncertainty. By contrast, root turnover rate, root respiration rate, and leaf width had little effect on model output; therefore trait data had little impact on model uncertainty. For fine-root allocation, the decrease in parameter uncertainty was offset by an increase in model sensitivity. Remaining model uncertainty is driven by growth respiration, fine-root allocation, leaf turnover rater, and specific leaf area. By establishing robust channels of feedback between data collection and ecosystem modeling, PEcAn provides a framework for more efficient and integrative science.",,,,"Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; LeBauer, David/N-2735-2013","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; LeBauer, David/0000-0001-7228-053X",Energy Biosciences Institute; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1062547],Funding for this research was provided by the Energy Biosciences Institute and an NSF Advances in Bioinformatics grant # 1062547 to M.

However, the determinants of seasonal changes within animal communities have rarely been explored, and the prognosis of community variation typically relies on identifying simple factors (e.g., mean temperature) that are assumed to have a constant effect throughout the year. Here we analyze the competing and changing roles of biotic (vegetation structure and phenology) and abiotic (temperature and elevation) factors in determining the richness and nestedness of montane Mediterranean oakwoods (central Spain) bird species in winter and spring. In winter, the most energy-demanding period, birds prefer mature forests with higher nocturnal temperatures where they can minimize thermoregulation costs during the long winter nights. In spring, which is the breeding season, spatial variation of species richness and nestedness is more deterministic than in winter. Breeding birds prefer lower forests with cooler temperatures at midday (presumably to avoid summer overheating stress), less unpredictable weather, and where trees develop leaves earlier (suggesting that birds, particularly those that prey on folivorous insects, would be able to breed early in the season). Thus, although both biotic and abiotic factors take part in the assemblage of local communities, the intervening specific components vary between seasons. For example, temperature-the factor most widely used to forecast future community changes-had opposite effects in winter than in spring. These results highlight the importance of fine-grained scale studies in accounting for temporal variation to understand both current and future regional biodiversity patterns.",,,,"Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Seoane, Javier/B-6833-2008; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016; Villen-Perez, Sara/J-8945-2016","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Seoane, Javier/0000-0001-9975-4846; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Villen-Perez, Sara/0000-0003-1832-1817",Spanish Ministry of Educacion y CienciaSpanish Government [CGL2008-02211/BOS],This paper was funded by project CGL2008-02211/BOS of the Spanish Ministry of Educacion y Ciencia.

The temporal analog of the SAR, the species-time relationship (STR), has received considerably less attention. Recent work primarily from the temperate zone has aimed to merge the SAR and the STR into a synthetic and unified species-time-area relationship (STAR) as originally envisioned by Preston (1960). Here we test this framework using two tropical tree communities and extend it by deriving a phylogenetic-time-area relationship (PTAR). The work finds some support for Preston's prediction that diversity-time relationships, both species and phylogenetic, are sensitive to the spatial scale of the sampling. Contrary to the Preston's predictions we find a decoupling of diversity-area and diversity-time relationships in both forests as the time period used to quantify the diversity-area relationship changes. In particular, diversity-area and diversity-time relationships are positively correlated using the initial census to quantify the diversity-area relationship, but weakly or even negatively correlated when using the most recent census. Thus, diversity-area relationships could forecast the temporal accumulation of biodiversity of the forests, but they failed to back-cast the temporal accumulation of biodiversity suggesting a decoupling of space and time.",,,,"Uriarte, Maria/L-8944-2013; Thompson, Jill/K-2200-2012","Thompson, Jill/0000-0002-4370-2593",Michigan State University; Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grant; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); University of Puerto Rico; International Institute of Tropical ForestryUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Andrew Mellon Foundation; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [CEH010021],"N.

However, an accurate description of species' geographic ranges as a function of the environment requires that species observations and climatic variables are measured at the same spatial and temporal resolution, which is usually not the case. Weather station data are interpolated and these resulting continuous data layers are incorporated into SDMs, often without any uncertainty assessment. Here we quantify the effects of three unrelated but complementary aspects of uncertainty in weather station interpolations on SDM performance using MaxEnt. We examine the influence of topographic heterogeneity, interannual variability, and distance to station on the over- and under-prediction of modeled North American bird distributions. Our species observations are derived from presence-absence information for 20 bird species with well-known distributions. These three metrics of uncertainty in interpolated weather station data have varying contributions to over- and under-prediction errors in SDMs. Topographic heterogeneity had the highest contribution to omission errors; the lowest contribution to commission errors was from Euclidean distance to station. The results confirm the importance of establishing an appropriate relational basis in time and space between species and climatic layers, providing key operational criteria for selection of species observations fed into SDMs. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying weather stations locations used in interpolated products, which will allow a characterization of some aspects of uncertainty and identification of regions where users need to be particularly careful when making a decision based on a SDM.",,,,"Kueppers, Lara M/M-8323-2013","Kueppers, Lara M/0000-0002-8134-3579; Fernandez, Miguel/0000-0002-8301-1340",WWF-Russell E; Train Education for Nature Program; California Landscape Conservation Cooperative,"We thank Dominique Bachelet at Oregon State University and Ned Gardiner at NOAA for fruitful discussions and insights on climate data uncertainty and John Dumbacher and Stanley Blum at the California Academy of Sciences for helpful critiques and guidance in statistical analysis.

Several reports recently showed that human Vibrio illnesses are increasing worldwide including fatal acute diarrheal diseases, such as cholera, gastroenteritis, wound infections, and septicemia. Many scientists believe this increase may be associated with global warming and rise in sea surface temperature (SST), although not enough evidence is available to support a causal link between emergence of Vibrio infections and climate warming. The effect of increased SST in promoting spread of vibrios in coastal and brackish waters is considered a causal factor explaining this trend. Field and laboratory studies carried out over the past 40 years supported this hypothesis, clearly showing temperature promotes Vibrio growth and persistence in the aquatic environment. Most recently, a long-term retrospective microbiological study carried out in the coastal waters of the southern North Sea provided the first experimental evidence for a positive and significant relationship between SST and Vibrio occurrence over a multidecadal time scale. As a future challenge, macroecological studies of the effects of ocean warming on Vibrio persistence and spread in the aquatic environment over large spatial and temporal scales would conclusively support evidence acquired to date combined with studies of the impact of global warming on epidemiologically relevant variables, such as host susceptibility and exposure. Assessing a causal link between ongoing climate change and enhanced growth and spread of vibrios and related illness is expected to improve forecast and mitigate future outbreaks associated with these pathogens.",,,,"Vezzulli, Luigi/J-2312-2015","Vezzulli, Luigi/0000-0002-4368-1454","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [2RO1A1039129-11A2-NIH]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oceans and Human Health InitiativeNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [S0660009]; Italian Ministry for Universities and Scientific and Technological Research (PRIN project)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); Genoa University","Support of the National Institutes of Health (Grant no. 2RO1A1039129-11A2-NIH) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oceans and Human Health Initiative (Grant no.

DNA sequence data obtained from these natural archives, combined with pioneering methods for analyzing both ecological and population genomic time-series data, are likely to provide predictive models to forecast evolutionary responses of natural populations to environmental changes resulting from natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climate change.",,,,"Colbourne, John K/L-7748-2014; Pfrender, Micheal E./C-5065-2019; Orsini, Luisa/B-6773-2009; Schwenk, Klaus/G-9603-2015; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015","Colbourne, John K/0000-0002-6966-2972; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Orsini, Luisa/0000-0002-1716-5624","Centre of Excellence by the KU Leuven [PF/2010/007]; FWOFWO [G.0614.11, G. 0468.10]; US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [0924289]; Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre Frankfurt am Main (BiEF; 'LOEWE-Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz' of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts); US NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0922251]; US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM078274]","This work is part of the STRESSFLEA project of the European Science Foundation EUROCORES Programme EuroEEFG.

Biweekly measurements over a 12-year period were used as input. The validation of models obtained with HEA showed the best results for bacillariophyta and dinophyta resulting in coefficients of determination (r(2)) between the modeled and measured data of 0.54-0.79 and 0.29-0.76 for these phyla, respectively, suggesting good predictability of their dynamics. The lowest adequacy of HEA models was found for cyanophyta (r(2) of 0.28-0.46). Models that combined physical, chemical and biological inputs scored highest, whilst zooplankton-based models scored lowest in all experiments and indicated that top-down control of algal biomass could have only secondary effect. The input sensitivity analysis was used for testing the best phytoplankton models with threshold values determining high or low algal biomass and inhibitory-excitatory effects of specific parameters. Wavelets were tested to analyze two extreme cases of dinophyta dynamics in years of its exceptionally high and low developments to gain insights into lag times between the exert of key factor and algae response. Lag times extracted from daily interpolated data of highly correlated inputs of dinophyta in 1998 varied between 2 and 4 days. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Because of the small extent of its watershed, meteorological conditions have caused dramatic floods and droughts over the centuries. Although numerous attempts have been made to regulate the lake level since Etruscan or Roman times, the problems related to water level changes remain unsolved, and the recently adaptive management strategies seem to be ineffective in the current climatic conditions. This study evaluates past and future management scenarios with the aim of identifying effective strategies to limit the lake level fluctuations. A lumped hydrological model, which incorporates climate forcing and water regulation policies adopted currently and in the past, is calibrated and validated using a fifty-year data series. Future scenarios (present2090) of water level change are simulated on the basis of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) regional projections for precipitation and temperature. Possible mitigation measures, such as those involving the enlargement of the catchment basin, the water diversion from nearby dams and the adoption of more restrictive rules on abstractions are also considered. The model indicates that critical prospects emerge if the intermediate or the maximum rates of change estimated by global climate models are assumed. Under these circumstances, currently feasible mitigation measures seem effective in preventing severe water shortage in the next decades, but ineffective in preventing the drainage of the lake in the second half of the century. We recommend that plans for water resource management should be put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure the conservation of the hydrologically vulnerable Lake Trasimeno.",,,,"Ludovisi, Alessandro/G-1973-2014; Casadei, Stefano/I-3475-2019","Casadei, Stefano/0000-0002-6619-7921",National funds F.I.S.R. within the M.I.C.E.N.A. project,"This research was financially supported by National funds F.I.S.R. within the M.I.C.E.N.A. project.

To implement sustainable management plans, resource managers need to accurately forecast species abundance. Moreover, an ecosystem-based approach to management requires forecasting the dynamics of all relevant species and the ability to anticipate indirect effects of management decisions. It is therefore crucial to determine which forecasting methods are most robust to observational and structural uncertainty. Here we describe a nonparametric method for multispecies forecasting and evaluate its performance relative to a suite of parametric models. We found that, in the presence of noise, it is often possible to obtain more accurate forecasts from the nonparametric method than from the model that was used to generate the data. The inclusion of data from additional species yielded a large improvement for the nonparametric model, a smaller improvement for the control model, and only a slight improvement for the alternative parametric models.

This paper examines Eucalyptus largiflorens floodplain woodland structure and condition in two contrasting regions within the same catchment. It assesses the effects of varying levels of irrigation land use intensity surrounding woodland sites and of flood history within sites, testing the following propositions: (i) floodplain woodlands with greater intensity of surrounding irrigation land use will be in worse condition and have less structural complexity than other floodplain woodlands; (ii) floodplain woodlands with flood histories closer to natural' regimes will be in better condition and will have greater structural complexity than other floodplain woodlands. This paper demonstrates that where groundwater tables have fallen, rainfall is in deficit and surface flooding occurs less than once every two years, E.largiflorens trees will be in poor condition and are more likely to die. In the absence of sufficient rainfall and groundwater, more frequent flooding is required to maintain E.largiflorens in good condition (less crown death and greater crown density) than would normally be required. Irrigation land use intensity affects variables that create habitat complexity in woodlands, such as the presence of old and young trees, and the abundance of shrubs such as lignum and Sclerolaena. Flow regimes (particularly prior wetting frequency) affect both structure and condition. These results have implications for understanding and management of elements of biodiversity dependent upon the resources provided by floodplain woodlands. They emphasize the importance of maintaining healthy black box remnants in irrigation areas for biodiversity persistence, and suggest that rehabilitation of black box communities in the Lowbidgee using managed flooding could bring significant biodiversity benefits to the region.

Here, we compare zooplankton communities from freshwater lakes in Norway and Canada that differ in their duration of exposure to the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes longimanus, to aid in predicting its potential long-term impacts on Canadian zooplankton communities. Location Freshwater lakes in Canada and Norway. Methods We compared differences in zooplankton community structure, richness and occurrence between lakes with and without Bythotrephes in Canada and Norway using univariate and multivariate analyses of the incidence of crustacean zooplankton species. Results Correspondence analysis confirmed that zooplankton community composition differed dramatically in lakes with and without Bythotrephes in Canada but not in Norway. The short-term exposure of Canadian lakes to Bythotrephes led to lower zooplankton diversity, particularly for cladoceran species, whereas in Norway, a greater diversity of zooplankton, particularly for copepod species, occurred in lakes where Bythotrephes has been present for long periods. Significantly more species in Norway demonstrated an increase in their frequency of occurrence, while significantly more species in Canada demonstrated a decrease, in lakes containing Bythotrephes. Main conclusions Bythotrephes can modify zooplankton community structure, diversity, and spatial occurrence across a watershed in a short period (i.e. a few decades) after invasion; however, some species appear to adapt to the presence of Bythotrephes over time. We hypothesize the long-term effects of higher diversity in Norwegian lakes is attributed to altered interspecific community interactions, coupled with behavioural adaptations to avoid Bythotrephes predation, enabling the remaining species to increase their populations in space and time. If Canadian communities adapt similarly, the long-term effects of Bythotrephes invasion in Canada may thus be less severe than those observed in the first few decades of the invasion.",,,,"KELLY, NOREEN E/H-7628-2019; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013","KELLY, NOREEN E/0000-0002-5432-5658; Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC CAISN,We thank Allegra Cairns for heading the sampling of the Canadian Shield 300 lakes survey and the Dorset Environmental Science Centre for water quality analyses.

Here, we use regionally downscaled climate models to highlight how spatial variation in forecast change could impact rare plant distributions differentially across the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya, part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot. Concordant with the theory that climatic stability facilitates the accumulation of rare species, we find significant positive correlations between endemic plant richness and future climatic persistence within the dispersal-limiting sky islands of this mountain archipelago. Further, we explore the hypothesis that mountain plants will move upslope in response to climate change and find that, conversely, some species are predicted to tend downslope, despite warmer annual conditions, driven by changes in seasonality and water availability. Importantly, two thirds of the modelled plant species are predicted to respond in different directions in different parts of their ranges, exemplifying the potential for individualistic responses of species and disjunct populations to environmental change, and the need for regional focus in climate change impact assessment. Conservation planners, and more broadly those charged with developing climate adaption policy, are advised to take caution in inferring local patterns of change from zoomed perspectives of broad-scale models. Moreover, a preoccupation with mean annual temperature as the principal driver of ecosystem change is misguided and could compromise efforts to make conservation plans resilient to future climate change. Faced with spatially complex and inherently uncertain future conditions, sensible priorities are to restore forest connectivity and to underpin adaption strategies with knowledge of how ecosystems and people have adapted to previous episodes of rapid change.",,,,"Platts, Philip J./C-2002-2009","Platts, Philip J./0000-0002-0153-0121; Marchant, Robert/0000-0001-5013-4056",Marie-Curie programme of the European 6th FrameworkEuropean Union (EU) [MEXT-CT-2004-517098]; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland; British Inst. in Eastern Africa,"We thank the many providers of plant data to the Missouri Botanical Garden's TROPICOS database, Jon Newell for heroic amounts of specimen data entry, and Stefan Hagemann and Daniela Jacob (Max Planck Inst. for Meteorology, Hamburg) for providing REMO climate forecasts for east Africa.

To understand and forecast how ecosystems will change over the coming decades, scientists will require an understanding of the sensitivity of species to environmental change. The current distribution of species and functional groups provides valuable information about the performance of various species in different environments. However, when the rate of environmental change is high, information inherent in the ranges of many species will disappear, since that information exists only under more or less steady-state conditions. The amount of information about species' relationships to climate declines as their distributions move farther from steady state. New remote-sensing technologies can map the chemical and structural traits of plant canopies and will allow for the inference of traits and, in many cases, species' ranges. Current satellite remote-sensing data can only produce relatively simple classifications, but new techniques will produce data with dramatically higher biological information content.

In a 13-year grassland experiment, we evaluated how elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), N fertilization, and plant species richness alter soil N cycling. We focused on soil inorganic N pools, including ammonium and nitrate, and two N fluxes, net N mineralization and net nitrification. In contrast with existing hypotheses, such as progressive N limitation, and with observations from other, often shorter, studies, elevated CO2 had relatively static and small, or insignificant, effects on soil inorganic N pools and fluxes. Nitrogen fertilization had inconsistent effects on soil N transformations, but increased soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Plant species richness had increasingly positive effects on soil N transformations over time, likely because in diverse subplots the concentrations of N in roots increased over time. Species richness also had increasingly positive effects on concentrations of ammonium in soil, perhaps because more carbon accumulated in soils of diverse subplots, providing exchange sites for ammonium. By contrast, subplots planted with 16 species had lower soil nitrate concentrations than less diverse subplots, especially when fertilized, probably due to greater N uptake capacity of subplots with 16 species. Monocultures of different plant functional types had distinct effects on N transformations and nitrate concentrations, such that not all monocultures differed from diverse subplots in the same manner. The first few years of data would not have adequately forecast the effects of N fertilization and diversity on soil N cycling in later years; therefore, the dearth of long-term manipulations of plant species richness and N inputs is a hindrance to forecasting the state of the soil N cycle and ecosystem functions in extant plant communities.",,,,"Mueller, Kevin E/I-3633-2019","Mueller, Kevin E/0000-0002-0739-7472; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research program [DEB-0620652]; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; US Department of Energy Program for Ecosystem ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-96ER62291]; National Institute for Climatic Change Research [DE-FC02-06ER64158],"Two reviewers provided helpful comments.

Can we assess how it may conflict with grassland diversity hotspots? Location Western Swiss Alps (4003210m a.s.l.). Methods We used statistical models to predict the location of land abandonment by farmers that is followed by forest regrowth in semi-natural grasslands of the Western Swiss Alps. Six modelling methods (GAM, GBM, GLM, RF, MDA, MARS) allowing binomial distribution were tested on two successive transitions occurring between three time periods. Models were calibrated using data on land-use change occurring between 1979 and 1992 as response, and environmental, accessibility and socio-economic variables as predictors, and these were validated for their capacity to predict the changes observed from 1992 to 2004. Projected probabilities of land-use change from an ensemble forecast of the six models were combined with a model of plant species richness based on a field inventory, allowing identification of critical grassland areas for the preservation of biodiversity. Results Models calibrated over the first land-use transition period predicted the second transition with reasonable accuracy. Forest regrowth occurs where cultivation costs are high and yield potential is low, i.e. on steeper slopes and at higher elevations. Overlaying species richness with land-use change predictions, we identified priority areas for the management and conservation of biodiversity at intermediate elevations.

We developed a stochastic, stage-based population model to forecast the population dynamics of the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) subject to white-nose syndrome. Our population model explicitly incorporated environmentally imposed annual variability in survival and reproductive rates and demographic stochasticity in predictions of extinction. With observed rates of disease spread, >90% of wintering populations were predicted to experience white-nose syndrome within 20 years, causing the proportion of populations at the quasi-extinction threshold of less than 250 females to increase by 33.9% over 50 years. At the species' lowest median population level, ca. year 2022, we predicted 13.7% of the initial population to remain, totaling 28,958 females (95% Cl = 13,330; 92,335). By 2022, only 12 of the initial 52 wintering populations were expected to possess wintering populations of >250 females. If the species can acquire immunity to the disease, we predict 3.7% of wintering populations to be above 250 females after 50 years (year 2057) after a 69% decline in abundance (from 210,741 to 64,768 [95% Cl = 49,386; 85,360] females). At the nadir of projections, we predicted regional quasi-extirpation of wintering populations in 2 of 4 Recovery Units while in a third region, where the species is currently most abundant, >95% of the wintering populations were predicted to be below 250 females. Our modeling suggests white-nose syndrome is capable of bringing about severe numerical reduction in population size and local and regional extirpation of the Indiana bat.

A common feature of ecologically damaging invaders is their ability to rapidly exploit and deplete resources. We thus hypothesized that the 'functional response' (the relationship between resource density and consumption rate) of such invasive species might be of consistently greater magnitude than those of taxonomically and/or trophically similar native species. Here, we derived functional responses of the predatory Ponto-Caspian freshwater 'bloody red' shrimp, Hemimysis anomala, a recent and ecologically damaging invader in Europe and N. America, in comparison to the local native analogues Mysis salemaai and Mysis diluviana in Ireland and Canada, respectively. This was conducted in a novel set of experiments involving multiple prey species in each geographic location and a prey species that occurs in both regions. The predatory functional responses of the invader were generally higher than those of the comparator native species and this difference was consistent across invaded regions. Moreover, those prey species characterized by the strongest and potentially de-stabilizing Type II functional responses in our laboratory experiments were the same prey species found to be most impacted by H. anomala in the field. The impact potential of H. anomala was further indicated when it exhibited similar or higher attack rates, consistently lower prey handling times and higher maximum feeding rates compared to those of the two Mysis species, formerly known as 'Mysis relicta', which itself has an extensive history of foodweb disruption in lakes to which it has been introduced. Comparative functional responses thus merit further exploration as a methodology for predicting severe community-level impacts of current and future invasive species and could be entered into risk assessment protocols.",,,,"Farnsworth, Keith/B-5546-2008; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010; Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008; Avlijas, Sunci/Y-6084-2019; Reid, Neil/M-8517-2019; Reid, Neil/D-1896-2010","Harrod, Chris/0000-0002-5353-1556; Reid, Neil/0000-0001-8951-8292; Reid, Neil/0000-0001-8951-8292; Farnsworth, Keith/0000-0001-8025-1114; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991; Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054; Haddaway, Neal R/0000-0003-3902-2234; Lewis, Susan/0000-0003-4557-4123",Inland Fisheries Ireland; Northern Ireland Environment Agency; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council; Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust,"We thank Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network for funding.

Improved understanding, monitoring and forecasting of its effects are thus crucial for researchers, policy makers and biodiversity managers. 2.Here, we provide a review and some meta-analyses of the literature reporting both observed and predicted climate-induced effects on the distribution of freshwater fish. After reviewing three decades of research, we summarise how methods in assessing the effects of climate change have evolved, and whether current knowledge is geographically or taxonomically biased. We conducted multispecies qualitative and quantitative analyses to find out whether the observed responses of freshwater fish to recent changes in climate are consistent with those predicted under future climate scenarios. 3.We highlight the fact that, in recent years, freshwater fish distributions have already been affected by contemporary climate change in ways consistent with anticipated responses under future climate change scenarios: the range of most cold-water species could be reduced or shift to higher altitude or latitude, whereas that of cool- and warm-water species could expand or contract. 4.Most evidence about the effects of climate change is underpinned by the large number of studies devoted to cold-water fish species (mainly salmonids). Our knowledge is still incomplete, however, particularly due to taxonomic and geographic biases. 5.Observed and expected responses are well correlated among families, suggesting that model predictions are supported by empirical evidence. The observed effects are of greater magnitude and show higher variability than the predicted effects, however, indicating that other drivers of changes may be interacting with climate and seriously affecting freshwater fish. 6.Finally, we suggest avenues of research required to address current gaps in what we know about the climate-induced effects on freshwater fish distribution, including (i) the need for more long-term data analyses, (ii) the assessment of climate-induced effects at higher levels of organisation (e.g. assemblages), (iii) methodological improvements (e.g. accounting for uncertainty among projections and species' dispersal abilities, combining both distributional and empirical approaches and including multiple non-climatic stressors) and (iv) systematic confrontation of observed versus predicted effects across multi-species assemblages and at several levels of biological organisation (i.e. populations and assemblages).",,,,"Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019","Comte, Lise/0000-0001-8030-0019", [ANR-09-PEXT-008-01],This manuscript has greatly benefited from the critical comments of Julien Cucherousset and Sebastien Brosse.

Comparable studies have largely not accounted for uncertainty, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions. We quantified the contribution of four sources of variation (choice of general circulation models, emission scenarios and species distribution modelling methods and variation in species distribution data) to uncertainty in forecasts and tested if our projections were robust to these uncertainties. Declines in the availability of suitable climate within the IBA network by 2100 were forecast as extremely likely' for 45% of species, whereas increases were projected for only 2%. Thus, we predict almost 24 times as many losers' as winners'. However, for no species was suitable climate extremely likely' to be completely lost from the network. Considerable turnover (median=43%, 95% CI=3569%) in species compositions of most IBAs were projected by 2100. Climatic conditions in 47% of IBAs were projected as extremely likely' to become suitable for fewer priority species. However, no IBA was forecast to become suitable for more species. Variation among General Circulation Models and Species Distribution Models contributed most to uncertainty among forecasts. This uncertainty precluded firm conclusions for 53% of species and IBAs because 95% confidence intervals included projections of no change. Considering this uncertainty, however, allows robust recommendations concerning the remaining species and IBAs. Overall, while the IBA network will continue to sustain bird conservation, climate change will modify which species each site will be suitable for. Thus, adaptive management of the network, including modified site conservation strategies and facilitating species' movement among sites, is critical to ensure effective future conservation.",,,,"Butchart, Stuart/Y-2711-2018; Bagchi, Robert/F-1732-2011; Hole, David/Q-1692-2019; Willis, Stephen/F-8503-2015","Bagchi, Robert/0000-0003-4035-4105; Willis, Stephen/0000-0002-8656-5808",MacArthur Foundation; SGW,"We thank the thousands of experts and organizations who contributed to defining species of conservation concern (through the IUCN Red List), mapping their distributions and identifying sites (IBAs) for their conservation.

However, the steps required to build S-SDMs implies at least two choices that influence its predictive performance which have not been extensively assessed: the selection of the modelling algorithm and the application of a threshold to transform the species-distribution models into binary maps to be added together to build the final S-SDM. Our goal was to provide guidelines concerning the best combinations of modelling algorithms and thresholds with which to build more accurate S-SDMs. We generated 380 S-SDMs of 1224 tree species in Mesoamerica by combining 19 distribution modelling methods with 20 different thresholds using presence-only data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We compared the predicted richness and composition with inventory data obtained from the BIOTREE-NET forest plot database. We designed two indicators of predictive performance that were based on the diversity factors used to measure species turnover: a (shared species between the observed and predicted compositions), b and c (the exclusive species of the predicted and observed compositions respectively) and compared them with the Sorensen and Beta-Simpson turnover measures. Our proposed indexes and the Sorensen index proved suitable as indicators of predictive performance for S-SDMs, whereas the Beta-Simpson turnover measure presented issues that would prevent its application to evaluate S-SDMs. Some modelling methods especially machine learning and ensemble model forecasting methods performed significantly better than others in minimizing the error in predicted richness and composition. Our results also points out that restrictive thresholds (with high omission errors) lead to more accurate S-SDMs in terms of species richness and composition. Here, we demonstrate that particular combinations of modelling methods and thresholds provide results with higher predictive performance. These results provide clear modelling guidelines that will help S-SDM modellers to select the appropriate combination of modelling methods and thresholds to build more accurate S-SDMs, and therefore will have a positive impact on the quality of the diversity models used to assist conservation planning.",,,,"Benito, Blas M./D-4681-2014; Cayuela, Luis/K-7255-2015","Benito, Blas M./0000-0001-5105-7232; Cayuela, Luis/0000-0003-3562-2662","'Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia, Junta de Andalucia' project [RNM-6734 (MIGRAME)]; project BIOTREE-NET [BIOCON08_044]; Fundacion BBVA","The authors are indebted to David Nesbitt for the English revision and to the Associate Editor and two anonymous referees, whose comments improved the quality of the article.

To avoid adverse effects of total reliance on chemical insecticides so as to ensure the ecological well balance of the agricultural ecosystems, there is a need to have eco-friendly control measures like biological control. For this, a good understanding of their population dynamics is critically important. Though there are several criticisms, a number of experiments have been conducted to develop forecasting models or expert systems for identifying the population, rates of growth or the damage. Those models are based on a number of mathematical models, including catastrophe theory, especially the cusp model. However, many of them are limited to the theoretical models but not to the practical systems or software. This study is aimed to analyze population dynamics of wheat aphids and to build a computer program (APHIDSim) integrating the swallowtail catastrophe theory. We built a swallowtail model from the aphid population as a function of three controlling factors: weather, crop and natural enemy in order to analyze the swallowtail behavior of population dynamics of wheat aphids. The APHIDSim is implemented integrating the swallowtail model and analyzed aphid population data for swallowtail behavior. The results show that the increase of wheat aphid population (population dynamics) is essentially a catastrophic behavior and sudden jumps may occur from one state to another even though the control factors change smoothly.

The derivation of the Hessian matrix becomes crucial when the condition number is used as a diagnostic indicator for identifiability. The covariance-inverse (CI) method was proposed to derive the Hessian matrix via the inverse matrix of covariance. The covariance matrix is calculated directly from the posterior parameter samples. Compared with two existing methods, i.e., difference quotients (DQ) and quasi-analytical (QA), CI is more efficient and reliable. The CI method was then used for identifiability diagnosis on a soil greenhouse gas emission (SoilGHG) model. The model as a whole was poorly identified, but a reduced model with fewer parameters could become identifiable, which is called ""conditionally identifiable"" in this paper. The geometric mean condition numbers in terms of sorted singular values of the full Hessian matrix could be adopted as criteria to determine at most how many undetermined parameters might be included in an identifiable or weakly identifiable model. The combinations of parameters that made the model identifiable were also determined by the proposed diagnosis method. We addressed the importance of understanding both identifiability and equifinality in ecosystem modeling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the lake's health degraded following the decrease of removal of submerged plants. Meanwhile, the ecological health improved when the removal of submerged plants increased to 1.5 times the normal level.

However, adequate integration among empirical approaches (monitoring and experimental) and modelling has rarely been achieved in FBR. We offer an appraisal of the issues involved and chart a course towards enhanced integration. A major element of this path is the joint orientation towards the continuous refinement of a theoretical framework for FBR that links theory testing and generalization with applied research oriented towards the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We further emphasize existing decision-making frameworks as suitable instruments to practically merge these different aims of FBR and bring them into application. This integrated framework requires joint research planning, and should improve communication and stimulate collaboration between modellers and empiricists, thereby overcoming existing reservations and prejudices.

This phenomenon presents great variability in space and time, a characteristic that makes attempts at modeling and forecasting FCO2 challenging. Although spatial estimates have been performed in several studies, the association of these estimates with the uncertainties inherent in the estimation procedures is not considered. This study aimed to evaluate the local, spatial, local-temporal and spatial-temporal uncertainties of short-term FCO2 after harvest period in a sugar cane area. The FCO2 was featured in a sampling grid of 60 m x 60 m containing 127 points with minimum separation distances from 0.5 to 10 m between points. The FCO2 was evaluated 7 times within a total period of 10 days. The variability of FCO2 was described by descriptive statistics and variogram modeling. To calculate the uncertainties, 300 realizations made by sequential Gaussian simulation were considered. Local uncertainties were evaluated using the probability values exceeding certain critical thresholds, while the spatial uncertainties considering the probability of regions with high probability values together exceed the adopted limits. Using the daily uncertainties, the local-spatial and spatial-temporal uncertainty (Ftemp) was obtained. The daily and mean emissions showed a variability structure that was described by spherical and Gaussian models. The differences between the daily maps were related to variations in the magnitude of FCO2, covering mean values ranging from 1.28 +/- 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (F197) to 1.82 +/- 0.07 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (F195). The Ftemp showed low spatial uncertainty coupled with high local uncertainty estimates. The average emission showed great spatial uncertainty of the simulated values. The evaluation of uncertainties associated with the knowledge of temporal and spatial variability is an important tool for understanding many phenomena over time, such as the quantification of greenhouse gases or the identification of areas with high crop productivity.

The geographic distributions of plant species show marked correlations with the current climate, suggesting that they are likely to shift if climate changes. However, before projecting any such shifts, it is important to establish whether distributions are at equilibrium with the current climate. If they are not, distributional shifts could occur even without climate change, making it difficult to tease apart climate-induced shifts from shifts occurring naturally without climate change. 2. We forecast the geographical distributions of the 10 most common trees occurring in the Iberian Peninsula using a new method that relaxes the species-climate equilibrium assumption implicit in most species distributions models. For each species, we developed a spatially explicit patch occupancy model (SPOM) with climate-dependent extinction rates and with colonization rates that depend on both climate and local seed dispersal. Bayesian methods were used to estimate the colonization, extinction and seed dispersal functions against observed colonization and extinction events recorded in repeat surveys of 46 596 forest plots in the Spanish Forest Inventories (1986-96 and 1997-2007). We then simulated distributional changes between the years 2000-2100. 3. Without climate change, 9 of the 10 species substantially increased in regional frequency. These increases occurred primarily within current ranges, although some species also expanded across their range edges. With climate change, one temperate conifer species and two sub-Mediterranean species would reduce their frequency of occurrence across the studied region, whereas temperate broad-leaved species were unaffected and Mediterranean species were either unaffected or increased their frequency of occurrence. 4. Synthesis. The analysis suggests that these species are substantially out of equilibrium, such that abundances and ranges would increase without climate change. Climate change may increase, decrease, stabilize or shift distributions, in a way that can only be understood by comparing predictions against baseline scenarios that account for these non-equilibrium range dynamics.",,,,"Garcia-Valdes, Raul/W-4226-2017; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015","Garcia-Valdes, Raul/0000-0001-6399-4709; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Araujo, Miguel/0000-0002-5107-7265; Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCI)Spanish Government [INTERBOS3-CGL2008-04503-C03-03]; INIA projectInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [SUM2008 00004 C03 01]; Microsoft Research Internship Program; F.P.I-M.C.I fellowship [BES-2007-14404]; Spanish Research Council (CSIC)Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); 'Rui Nabeiro/Delta' Biodiversity Chair; Danish NSF,"We thank the MAGRAMA ('Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentacion y Medio Ambiente') for granting access to the forest inventory data.

The purpose of the current study was to use hydrothermal germination models and a soil energy and water flux model to evaluate intra- and interannual variability in seedbed microclimate relative to potential germination response of six perennial grasses and cheatgrass. We used a 44-yr weather record to parameterize a seedbed microclimate model for estimation of hourly temperature and moisture at seeding depth for a sandy loam soil type at the Orchard Field Test Site in southwestern Ada County, Idaho. Hydrothermal germination response was measured in the laboratory for two seed lots of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), four seed lots of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] Love), three seed lots of bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf] Swezey), and one seed lot each of Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.), big squirreltail (Elymus multisetus [J.G. Smith] M.E. Jones), thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus [Scribn. And J.G. Smith] Gould) and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer). Germination response models were developed to estimate potential germination rate for 13 subpopulations of each seed lot for every hour of the 44-yr simulation. Seedbed microclimate was assessed seasonally and for each day, month, and year, and germination rate-sum estimates integrated for a numerical index of relative site favorability for germination for each time period. The rate-sum favorability index showed a consistent pattern among seed lots for different years, and provides a relatively sensitive indicator of annual and seasonal variability in seedbed microclimate. This index could be used with field data to define minimum weather thresholds for successful establishment of alternative plant materials, in conjunction with weather forecast models for making restoration and fire-rehabilitation management decisions in the fall season, for evaluation of potential climate-change impacts on plant community trajectories, and in optimization schemes for selecting among alternative restoration/rehabilitation management scenarios.",,,,,"Clark, Patrick/0000-0003-4299-1853; Moffet, Corey/0000-0002-7071-7539; Flerchinger, Gerald/0000-0002-5156-5090","Bureau of Land Management, Intermountain Greenstripping and Rehabilitation Research Project; USDA-ARS Ecologically Based Invasive Plant Management program","Research was funded in part by the Bureau of Land Management, Intermountain Greenstripping and Rehabilitation Research Project, and the USDA-ARS Ecologically Based Invasive Plant Management program.",,,26,27,1,46,,,,1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Park boundaries, however, offer no protection against climatic change and where boundaries are actual constructions, they may also act as physical barriers to species movements to new suitable habitats. The means for assessing the consequences of climate change on ecosystems and for identifying gaps in PA connectivity are therefore a conservation priority. The complexity of the scientific questions raised requires a multidisciplinary approach given the variety of the information required. This includes species observations and their theoretical distributions, as well as ecosystem assessments and climate change models. Such complex questions can be more easily dealt with if there is appropriate access to data and models, a strategy endorsed by GEO-BON, the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network. In this paper, we show how data and models recently made available on the World Wide Web can be coupled through interoperable services and used for climate change forecasting in the context of Important Bird Areas (IBAs) and how, for any bird species described in the databases, areas can be identified where the species may find a more suitable environment in the future.

This approach was conducted to forecast the distribution patterns of some soil biological indices in Mirabad area, North West of Iran. Three different land uses (apple orchard, crop production, and rich pasture) were selected to conduct the experiments in a randomized completely blocks design with five blocks. Soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected on mid July 2010. Soil biological indices i.e. (i) substrate induced respiration, (ii) microbial biomass carbon, (iii) the activity of urease; (iv) alkaline phosphomonoesterase, and also (v) dehydrogenase were determined. Kriging and inverse distance weighting methods were applied to assess the spatial variability of five stated indices. Ordinary kriging was applied because it is the most general and widely used method. Digital soil biological indices maps will be the last output of integrating geostatistics and geographical information system. The study, while addressing spatial variability of soil biological properties, also discusses the accuracy of modeling as well as spherical model is now distinguished as the best fitted model. Assessing spatial variability of alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity has the lowest accuracy than urease and dehydrogenase activities. The geostatistical results showed that management practices might not have relevant effect on microbial biomass carbon and enzyme activities. But, the statistical analysis revealed significant differences between pasture and two other land uses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The challenge is that some behaviors are poorly known and difficult to estimate. We assessed how uncertainty in behavioral responses to dense woods, an avoided landscape structure, impacts functional connectivity among reproductive habitat patches for Fender's blue butterfly, an endangered prairie species of western Oregon, USA. We designed a factorial simulation experiment using a spatially explicit individual-based model to project functional connectivity for female butterflies across current and alternative landscapes. We varied the probability of dense woods entry and turning angle standard deviation for movements within the dense woods over a range of biologically reasonable and observed values. Butterflies in the current landscape (46 % dense woods) and one with prairie encroached by forest (60 % dense woods) showed reductions in functional connectivity estimates consistent with the expectations of habitat fragmentation. Although dense woods entrance uncertainty impacted functional connectivity projections, uncertainty in the dense woods turning angle standard deviation had comparatively little impact on connectivity estimates. Reduction and reconfiguration of the current dense woods to 27 % cover (restored landscape) appeared to facilitate a corridor behavior in dispersing individuals, likely providing a functional connectivity estimate comparable to the historic landscape (< 5 % dense woods). Our simulations suggest that additional study of butterfly movement within the dense woods is unnecessary and that a partial reduction in dense woods would be sufficient to achieve historic levels of functional connectivity for Fender's blue across the study landscape.",,,,"McIntire, Eliot/F-7995-2011","McIntire, Eliot/0000-0002-6914-8316; Schultz, Cheryl/0000-0003-3388-8950","US Fish and Wildlife Service, Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), Washington State University Vancouver; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chair programCanada Research Chairs","We thank the Cardwell Hills private landowners (Charlie and Rich Clark, PK and Dai Crisp, Karen Fleck-Harding, Lorin and Josh Lidell, William Pearcy, and Amy Schoener) for enabling the study of Fender's blue butterflies on their properties.

Here, we use a novel phylogenetic approach to test whether biotic interactions constrain the transition to secondary sympatry following speciation. Applying this temporal framework to a diverse clade of passerine birds (Furnariidae), we reject models of geographic range overlap limited purely by dispersal or environmental constraints, and instead show that rates of secondary sympatry are positively associated with both the phylogenetic and morphological distance between species. Thus, transition rates to sympatry increase with time since divergence and accelerate as the ecological differences between species accumulate. Taken together, these results provide strong empirical evidence that biotic interactions and primarily ecological competition limit species distributions across large spatial and temporal scales. They also offer phylogenetic and trait-based metrics by which these interactions can be incorporated into ecological forecasting models.",,,,,"Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I028068/1],,,,115,116,6,202,,,,1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Extensive reviews of the literature and manipulative experiments suggest that mangroves will be impacted by climate change, but few studies have tested these predictions over large scales using statistical models. We provide the first example of applying species and community distribution models (SDMs and CDMs, respectively) to coastal mangroves worldwide. Species distributions were modeled as ensemble forecasts using BIOMOD. Distributions of mangrove communities with high species richness were modeled in three ways: as the sum of the separate SDM outputs, as binary hotspots (with >3 species) using a generalized linear model, and continuously using a general boosted model. Individual SDMs were projected for 12 species with sufficient data and CDMs were projected for 30 species into 2080 using global climate model outputs and a range of sea-level rise projections. Species projected to shift their ranges polewards by at least 2 degrees of latitude consistently experience a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them. Central America and the Caribbean are forecast to lose more mangrove species than other parts of the world. We found that the extent and grain size, at which continuous CDM outputs are examined, independent of the grain size at which the models operate, can dramatically influence the number of pseudo-absences needed for optimal parameterization. The SDMs and CDMs presented here provide a first approximation of how mangroves will respond to climate change given simple correlative relationships between occurrence records and environmental data.

Here, we explore how to combine historical observations of crop yields and weather with climate model simulations to produce crop yield projections for decision relevant timescales. Firstly, the effects on historical crop yields of improved technology, precipitation and daily maximum temperatures are modelled empirically, accounting for a nonlinear technology trend and interactions between temperature and precipitation, and applied specifically for a case study of maize in France. The relative importance of precipitation variability for maize yields in France has decreased significantly since the 1960s, likely due to increased irrigation. In addition, heat stress is found to be as important for yield as precipitation since around 2000. A significant reduction in maize yield is found for each day with a maximum temperature above 32 similar to degrees C, in broad agreement with previous estimates. The recent increase in such hot days has likely contributed to the observed yield stagnation. Furthermore, a general method for producing near-term crop yield projections, based on climate model simulations, is developed and utilized. We use projections of future daily maximum temperatures to assess the likely change in yields due to variations in climate. Importantly, we calibrate the climate model projections using observed data to ensure both reliable temperature mean and daily variability characteristics, and demonstrate that these methods work using retrospective predictions. We conclude that, to offset the projected increased daily maximum temperatures over France, improved technology will need to increase base level yields by 12% to be confident about maintaining current levels of yield for the period 20162035; the current rate of yield technology increase is not sufficient to meet this target.",,,,"Hawkins, Ed/Y-2421-2019; Hawkins, Ed/B-7921-2011; Challinor, Andrew/C-4992-2008; Challinor, Andrew/AAK-3023-2020","Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677; Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677; Challinor, Andrew/0000-0002-8551-6617; Challinor, Andrew/0000-0002-8551-6617","NCAS-Climate; NERC EQUIP project; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H003525/1, NE/H003509/1, NE/H003460/1, ncas10009]","EH, TMO, CATF and CKH are supported by NCAS-Climate, and all authors are supported by the NERC EQUIP project.

A multi-temporal model calibration approach has been suggested as an alternative, and we evaluate this using 13,000 years of data. Location Europe. Methods We used fossil-based records of presence for Picea abies, Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica and six climatic variables for the period 13,000 to 1000yr bp. To measure the contribution of each 1000-year time step to the total niche of each species (the niche measured by pooling all the data), we employed a principal components analysis (PCA) calibrated with data over the entire range of possible climates. Then we projected both the total niche and the partial niches from single time frames into the PCA space, and tested if the partial niches were more similar to the total niche than random. Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we calibrated SDMs for each time frame and for the pooled database. We projected each model to current climate and evaluated the results against current pollen data. We also projected all models into the future. Results Niche similarity between the partial and the total-SDMs was almost always statistically significant and increased through time. SDMs calibrated from single time frames gave different results when projected to current climate, providing evidence of a change in the species realized niches through time. Moreover, they predicted limited climate suitability when compared with the total-SDMs. The same results were obtained when projected to future climates. Main conclusions The realized climatic niche of species differed for current and future climates when SDMs were calibrated considering different past climates. Building the niche as an ensemble through time represents a way forward to a better understanding of a species' range and its ecology in a changing climate.",,,,"Maiorano, Luigi/A-8637-2008; Pearman, Peter/C-6298-2011; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Broennimann, Olivier/D-3495-2011; Hurdu, Bogdan/C-8781-2011; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020; Psomas, Achilleas/M-1141-2013; Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015","Maiorano, Luigi/0000-0002-2957-8979; Pearman, Peter/0000-0002-0794-101X; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Broennimann, Olivier/0000-0001-9913-3695; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Hurdu, Bogdan-Iuliu/0000-0002-3165-108X; Bronnimann, Olivier/0000-0001-5394-4564; Vittoz, Pascal/0000-0003-4218-4517",,,,,99,99,1,164,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Location The Mediterranean Sea. Methods Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we used species distribution modelling to project the potential distribution of 288 coastal fish species by the middle and end of the 21st century based on the IPCC A2 scenario implemented with the Mediterranean climatic model NEMOMED8. Results A mean rise of 1.4 degrees C was projected for the Mediterranean Sea by the middle of the 21st century and 2.8 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. Projections for the end of the century suggest that: (1) 54 species are expected to lose their climatically suitable habitat, (2) species richness was predicted to decrease across 70.4% of the continental shelf area, especially in the western Mediterranean Sea and several parts of the Aegean Sea, and (3) mean fish body size would increase over 74.8% of the continental shelf area. Small-bodied species that are not targeted by either commercial or recreational fleets presented, on average, the highest predicted decrease in geographic range size. Main conclusions Projected climate change in the Mediterranean Sea may have deleterious effects on coastal fish diversity, including a significant loss of climatically suitable habitat for endemic fish species. In addition, climate change may contribute to the loss of small and low trophic-level fishes, which may have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger and higher trophic-level species. Fishing pressure is already selectively removing large-bodied species from marine ecosystems, and so fishing and climatic change might act in tandem to drive both direct and secondary extinctions.",,,,"Leprieur, Fabien/C-4430-2008; Le Loc'h, Francois/A-5038-2008; albouy, camille/H-9317-2012","Le Loc'h, Francois/0000-0002-3372-6997; albouy, camille/0000-0003-1629-2389; Aznar, Roland/0000-0002-9793-1834; Guilhaumon, Francois/0000-0003-4707-8932; Ben Rais Lasram, Frida/0000-0003-3327-908X; Somot, Samuel/0000-0002-5066-2921",Total Foundation; 'Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite' (project BIODIVMED); Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (FISHECO)European Union (EU) [IOF-GA-2009-236316]; project PERSEUS (Policy-oriented marine Environmental Research for the Southern European Seas) [FP7-287600]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/AAC-AMB/098163/2008]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Delta Cafes,"We thank Regan Early for her constructive comments on the manuscript and language editing.

For many systems, increases in diversity capacity have been forecast, with spare capacity to be taken up by a pool of weedy species moved around by humans. Few tests of this hypothesis have been undertaken, and in many temperate systems, climate change impacts may be confounded by simultaneous increases in human-related disturbance, which also promote weedy species. Areas to which weedy species are being introduced, but with little human disturbance, are therefore ideal for testing the idea. We make predictions about how such diversity capacity increases play out across elevational gradients in non-water-limited systems. Then, using modern and historical data on the elevational range of indigenous and naturalized alien vascular plant species from the relatively undisturbed sub-Antarctic Marion Island, we show that alien species have contributed significantly to filling available diversity capacity and that increases in energy availability rather than disturbance are the probable underlying cause.",,,,"Kalwij, Jesse/AAC-8439-2019; Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011; McGeoch, Melodie A/F-8353-2011; Kalwij, Jesse M/H-2571-2012; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011","Kalwij, Jesse/0000-0002-8685-9603; Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105; McGeoch, Melodie A/0000-0003-3388-2241; Kalwij, Jesse M/0000-0002-8685-9603; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; shaw, justine/0000-0002-9603-2271",South African National Research FoundationNational Research Foundation - South Africa [SNA2007042400003]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence FIBIR)European Union (EU),"We acknowledge support from South African National Research Foundation Grant SNA2007042400003, and, for J.M.K., from the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence FIBIR).

However, modelling studies consistently have projected that climate change is likely to increase the intensity of cyclones and the related rainfall rates in the future. A precautionary approach to this possibility is to adapt to the adverse effects of the changing climate by improving early warning services for cyclones as a 'no or low-regrets' option. Given limited funding resources, assessments of economic efficiency will be necessary, and values for benefits are an essential input. This paper aims to estimate the benefits to households of an improved cyclone warning service in Vietnam. Choice experiment surveys with 1014 respondents were designed and conducted to inform this paper. The benefit estimates of the maximal improvements in a number of attributes of cyclone warning services (i.e. forecasting accuracy, frequency of update, and mobile phone based warnings) are approximately USD7.1-8.1 per household, which would be an upper bound estimate. Results from the marginal willingness to pay for the attributes suggest that investments should be dedicated to improvements in the accuracy of warning information and a warning service based on mobile phone short message.

However, few studies have sought to distinguish the causal basis of abundance structure and range limits. Here we do so for an invasive springtail species, Pogonognathellus flavescens, in a cold temperate island setting. Local microclimate variables and physiological tolerances of this habitat generalist suggest that it should be widely distributed across a range of habitats below 200 m elevation on the island. By contrast, island-wide and local abundance surveys show that it is restricted to indigenous Poa cookii tussock grassland habitats in the southeast. Preference for this habitat is correlated with the presence of vertebrates and a threshold response to soil Ca and pH, with preference for low values of both. Habitat specificity may be the consequence of a founder effect because the species is characterized by only a single mitochondrial COI haplotype. Nonetheless, P. flavescens is absent from many other areas of suitable P. cookii habitat around the island. The most plausible explanation appears to be dispersal limitation (i.e. a contingent absence). Despite high locomotion speeds measured in the laboratory at optimum and mean annual soil temperatures (0.97 and 0.42 cm s1 at 26 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively), dispersal in the field indicated that >100 yr would be required to reach all available habitat in the absence of jump dispersal, for which few vectors exist. Thus, current range limits are set by dispersal limitation (i.e. contingent absences) whilst abundance structure is a function of variation in soil substrate quality. Edaphic variables both in this species and other soil invertebrates may be more significant than climatic factors in determining abundance and occurrence, indicating that they should be routinely included in species distribution models. Low genetic diversity and high habitat preference suggest that in the absence of introduction of additional individuals, the species will not spread rapidly at the island. However, over time, the widening distribution of its preferred habitat, P. cookii, as a consequence of a major management intervention (the eradication of feral cats), may enable it to colonize all suitable areas.",,,,"Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011","Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105; Treasure, Anne/0000-0002-8345-4811",National Research Foundation [SNA2007042400003],"Mashudu Mashau, Martin Slabber, Aleks Terauds, Steven Johnson, Cang Hui and Peter le Roux are thanked for assistance and/or discussion.

While greater late-season precipitation increases the weight gain of adult and young bison, greater mid-season precipitation decreases their weight gain. In addition, calving rates are lower after years with greater mid-season precipitation and higher after years with greater late-season precipitation.

Models were based on four methods for modeling ecological niches, and three future climate simulations. Combinations of these models were used to estimate species occurrences. We used species occurrences to optimize the current and future representation of amphibians with different conservation targets based on their geographic range size. We compared spatial priority outcomes (variance of site selection frequency scores) under dynamic conditions, using a bi-dimensional plot in which the relative importance of each site in achieving conservation targets was assessed both for current time and to 2050. Projections for 2050 show that species richness pattern will remain approximately constant, whereas high turnover rates are forecasted. Selection frequency of several locations varied widely, with recurrent sites located at the north and southeast of the biome. As for 2050, spatial priorities concentrate in the northern part of the biome. Thirty-three sites have high priority for conservation as they play an important role now and will still stand as priority locations in 2050.

We also generate a future land-use model that indicates how the region would be impacted by habitat loss in the future. We then used our models to propose priority sites for mammal conservation minimizing species climate-forced dispersal distance as well as the mean uncertainty associated to species distribution models and climate models. At the same time, our proposal maximizes complementary species representation across the existing network of protected areas. Including land-use changes and model uncertainties in the planning process changed significantly the spatial distribution of priority sites in the region. While the inclusion of land-use models altered the spatial location of priority sites at the regional scale, the effects of climate change tended to operate at the local scale. Our solutions already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future priority sites for mammal. conservation, as well as a formal risk analysis based on planning uncertainties. We hope to provide decision makers with conservation portfolios that could be negotiated at the decision level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, the hypothesis that climate change will favour non-native species has been examined exclusively through local comparisons of single or few species. Here, we take a meta-analytical approach to broadly evaluate whether non-native species are poised to respond more positively than native species to future climatic conditions. We compiled a database of studies in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that reported performance measures of non-native (157 species) and co-occurring native species (204 species) under different temperature, CO2 and precipitation conditions. Our analyses revealed that in terrestrial (primarily plant) systems, native and non-native species responded similarly to environmental changes. By contrast, in aquatic (primarily animal) systems, increases in temperature and CO2 largely inhibited native species. There was a general trend towards stronger responses among non-native species, including enhanced positive responses to more favourable conditions and stronger negative responses to less favourable conditions. As climate change proceeds, aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion. Across systems, there could be a higher risk of invasion at sites becoming more climatically hospitable, whereas sites shifting towards harsher conditions may become more resistant to invasions.",,,,"Dukes, Jeffrey S/C-9765-2009; Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010; Diez, Jeffrey/AAD-5956-2019; Miller, Luke/B-8992-2009; Dukes, Jeffrey/AAD-8791-2019","Dukes, Jeffrey S/0000-0001-9482-7743; Miller, Luke/0000-0002-2009-6981; Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187","Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DOE-ER64982]; National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0553768]; University of California, Santa BarbaraUniversity of California System; State of California","We thank J.

American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus is an alien invasive species, which is suspected to cause substantial ecological damage around the globe. However, control of bullfrog populations is difficult, as no conclusive management measures have yet been determined. We investigated how double fyke nets could contribute to bullfrog management by assessing the tadpole population size in 10 permanent small shallow water bodies. Two population size estimate methods were applied, being the catch-depletion and mark-recapture method. Catchability of bullfrog tadpoles proved to be very consistent over ponds and methods, with one catch per unit of effort (one double fyke net for 24 h) retaining on average 6 % of the tadpole population. Population density varied considerably among ponds, ranging from 950 to 120,804 larger tadpole individuals/ha. Using these insights in developing a cost-efficient eradication program for the species, we projected the number of catch efforts needed to reduce tadpole numbers to a threshold that more than likely affects final bullfrog population size. Predictions indicated that for the specified thresholds the use of eight double fyke nets at a time is most cost-efficient in high abundance populations, while using five double fyke nets seems most suitable in low abundance populations. What the exact threshold number of remaining tadpole individuals should be is uncertain, but forecasts demonstrate that only half of the budget would be needed when aiming at a drop to fewer than 100 remaining tadpoles than when a decrease to fewer than 10 remaining tadpoles is pursued. Given the fairly limited cost of bullfrog management with double fyke nets, however, it may be worthwhile to fully reduce the tadpole population.",,,,"Adriaens, Tim/F-6936-2010; Devisscher, Sander/M-1658-2019","Adriaens, Tim/0000-0001-7268-4200; Devisscher, Sander/0000-0003-2015-5731; Louette, Gerald/0000-0003-3548-2364",EU Interreg IV A project [IVA-VLANED-2.31],"This study was performed in the framework of EU Interreg IV A project IVA-VLANED-2.31 ""Invasieve exoten in Vlaanderen en Zuid-Nederland-INVEXO"".

This study investigates the effects of climate change on paddy rice production in the temperate climate regions under the East Asian monsoon system using the CERES-Rice 4.0 crop simulation model. This model was first calibrated and validated for crop production under elevated CO2 and various temperature conditions. Data were obtained from experiments performed using a temperature gradient field chamber (TGFC) with a CO2 enrichment system installed at Chonnam National University in Gwangju, Korea in 2009 and 2010. Based on the empirical calibration and validation, the model was applied to deliver a simulated forecast of paddy rice production for the region, as well as for the other Japonica rice growing regions in East Asia, projecting for years 2050 and 2100. In these climate change projection simulations in Gwangju, Korea, the yield increases (+12.6 and +22.0%) due to CO2 elevation were adjusted according to temperature increases showing variation dependent upon the cultivars, which resulted in significant yield decreases (-22.1% and -35.0%). The projected yields were determined to increase as latitude increases due to reduced temperature effects, showing the highest increase for any of the study locations (+24%) in Harbin, China. It appears that the potential negative impact on crop production may be mediated by appropriate cultivar selection and cultivation changes such as alteration of the planting date. Results reported in this study using the CERES-Rice 4.0 model demonstrate the promising potential for its further application in simulating the impacts of climate change on rice production from a local to a regional scale under the monsoon climate system.",,,,,,"Bio-industry Technology Development Program, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea GrantNational Research Foundation of Korea [KRF 2011-0009827]","This study was supported by Bio-industry Technology Development Program, Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Korea, and partially supported by the government-funded National Research Foundation of Korea Grant (KRF 2011-0009827).",,,60,62,5,133,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Aldabrachelys gigantea giant tortoises have recently been introduced to three islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Ile aux Aigrettes, Round Island and Rodrigues) to resurrect herbivory and seed dispersal functions once performed by extinct giant tortoises. However, potential unintended impacts by frugivore substitutes on native ecosystems, e. g. whether they will facilitate the germination of exotic plant species, are largely unknown. We investigated whether A. gigantea introduced to Rodrigues in 2006 could enhance the germination percentage of four widespread fleshy-fruited exotic species on the island. Using germination trials to forecast unintended impacts that could arise from the introduction of a frugivorous taxon substitute enables conservation managers to limit potential adverse negative interactions before they occur. Methods In germination trials that ran over 4 months, we investigated the effects of ingestion (gut passage and deposition in faeces) by sub-adult and adult A. gigantea on the germination percentage of four exotic fleshy-fruited plant species introduced to Rodrigues. We fed fruits of these plant species to sub-adult and adult A. gigantea to test how variation in age and size of the frugivore would affect seed germination. Feeding of distinctly coloured plastic pellets together with the fruits allowed us to test for individual tortoise effects on seed germination. Important Findings Ingestion by A. gigantea increased the percentage of seeds germinating of Mimusops coriacea and Lantana camara, but not percentage of germination of Veitchia merrillii or Wikstroemia indica. Seeds were more likely to germinate following ingestion by sub-adult rather than adult tortoises, which may be a consequence of the shorter gut passage time observed for sub-adults. Our results demonstrate that introduced frugivorous taxon substitutes could facilitate germination of exotic and invasive plants and highlight the need for conservation managers to weigh the risk of taxon substitutes potentially facilitating the germination and recruitment of exotic fleshy-fruited plants against the benefit of restoring lost seed dispersal functions of threatened indigenous plants. Our findings also highlight the importance of considering age and size variation in frugivores, in particular in long-lived taxa such as giant tortoises, when studying ingestion effects on the germination performance of plants.",,,,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214",,,,,5,5,0,45,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Ideally, enough information will be collected to enable management strategy evaluations on the stock, providing guidance on future management decisions. In many fisheries management agencies, however, the ability to rapidly and cost-effectively build and run models to evaluate management strategies is as much an impediment to their development as the lack of data. The BIOMAS software provides users with the ability to rapidly develop single or multi-species, length-based population dynamics models for the exploration of alternative management strategies in a Bayesian-based framework. The system is theoretically capable of incorporating any number of species, fishing fleets and spatial compartments in a single model. Further complexity is provided with the ability to implement management and environmental effects on stocks as well as the tracking of economic costs and revenue from fishing activity. However, in practice model complexity will be limited by the needs of the modelling project, by the availability of data and by the modelling project timeline. By incorporating Bayesian methods, including prior probability distributions, the BIOMAS system enables users to explore the uncertainty surrounding a limited number of parameter values and to incorporate this uncertainty into the model results. Sensitivity analyses can be run against virtually all model parameters providing insight into the key drivers for the model and likely candidates for Bayesian priors. A number of management indicators are provided for all stocks and fleets in the model including stock depletion, catch weights, age- and length-frequencies, discard mortality estimates and fleet profits - each with Bayesian-based confidence intervals. Such indicators become the primary means of comparing the effectiveness of alternative management strategies when using the system forecasting capabilities. Through the inclusion of stochastic processes, such as process error and environmental and pricing fluctuations, each management strategy can also be evaluated for its robustness to such uncertainty. The ability to reflect more of our uncertainty in modelled outcomes, which tools such as BIOMAS provide, can unfortunately come at the expense of clarity in the outcomes. This is only because these models better encompass our lack of knowledge about fishery systems. Fortunately, such modelling tools can also provide us with a clearer understanding of the main sources of this uncertainty. Furthermore, the unique design of the BIOMAS system allows users to undertake 'research strategy evaluations' in which the costs and benefits of different forms of research can be compared, allowing managers and research leaders to see more clearly the benefits of targeted research to reduce these uncertainties.

Irregular plagues of house mice cause high production losses in grain crops in Australia. If plagues can be forecast through broad-scale monitoring or model-based prediction, then mice can be proactively controlled by poison baiting. Aims. To predict mouse plagues in grain crops in Queensland and assess the value of broad-scale monitoring. Methods. Regular trapping of mice at the same sites on the Darling Downs in southern Queensland has been undertaken since 1974. This provides an index of abundance over time that can be related to rainfall, crop yield, winter temperature and past mouse abundance. Other sites have been trapped over a shorter time period elsewhere on the Darling Downs and in central Queensland, allowing a comparison of mouse population dynamics and cross-validation of models predicting mouse abundance. Key results. On the regularly trapped 32-km transect on the Darling Downs, damaging mouse densities occur in 50% of years and a plague in 25% of years, with no detectable increase in mean monthly mouse abundance over the past 35 years. High mouse abundance on this transect is not consistently matched by high abundance in the broader area. Annual maximum mouse abundance in autumn-winter can be predicted (R-2 = 57%) from spring mouse abundance and autumn-winter rainfall in the previous year. In central Queensland, mouse dynamics contrast with those on the Darling Downs and lack the distinct annual cycle, with peak abundance occurring in any month outside early spring. On average, damaging mouse densities occur in 1 in 3 years and a plague occurs in 1 in 7 years. The dynamics of mouse populations on two transects similar to 70 km apart were rarely synchronous. Autumn-winter rainfall can indicate mouse abundance in some seasons (R-2 = similar to 52%). Conclusion. Early warning of mouse plague formation in Queensland grain crops from regional models should trigger farm-based monitoring. This can be incorporated with rainfall into a simple model predicting future abundance that will determine any need for mouse control. Implications. A model-based warning of a possible mouse plague can highlight the need for local monitoring of mouse activity, which in turn could trigger poison baiting to prevent further mouse build-up.",,,,,,Grains Research and Development CorporationGrains R&D Corp,"The data presented here have been collected by numerous people, including the late John Wilson, Steve Cantrill, Christine Donkin, Judy Caughley, John Conroy, Craig Hunter and Kevin Strong.

Even though the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model has been applied in many regions, the resolution for inputting meteorology field analysis still impacts the accuracy of forecast. This article describes the application of the CIMSS Regional Assimilation System (CRAS) in East China, and its capability to assimilate the direct broadcast (DB) satellite data for obtaining more detailed meteorological information, including cloud top pressure (CTP) and total precipitation water (TPW) from MODIS. Performance evaluation of CRAS is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses. Compared with data collected from ERA-Interim, Radiosonde, and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation measurements using bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), CRAS has a systematic error due to the impact of topography and other factors; however, the forecast accuracy of all elements in the model center area is higher at various levels. The bias computed with Radiosonde reveals that the temperature and geopotential height of CRAS are better than ERA-Interim at first guess. Moreover, the location of the 24 h accumulated precipitation forecast are highly consistent with the TRMM retrieval precipitation, which means that the performance of CRAS is excellent.

Disentangling these direct and indirect effects is of fundamental importance for ecological forecasts of changing climate on species interactions and their influence on biogenic habitat. Whilst elevated atmospheric CO2 may have direct effects on grazers with calcareous structures via 'ocean acidification', it may also have indirect effects via changes caused to their food. In our study we initially tested, and confirmed, that enriched CO2 altered per capita rates of grazing before assessing the relative importance of indirect and direct effects in driving this response. Our results eliminated the model of a direct effect of CO2 enrichment on the grazers themselves and supported the model of an indirect effect driven by a change in the food (i.e. turf algae). We suggest that this indirect effect manifested as grazers responded to the increased nitrogen content (i.e. %N) of algal tissue that resulted under CO2 enrichment. Understanding such indirect effects of modified environmental conditions provide important mechanistic links between climate conditions and the ecological processes they influence.",,,,"Russell, Bayden D./R-9325-2019; Connell, Sean D/A-8874-2008; Falkenberg, Laura/AAC-3227-2020","Russell, Bayden D./0000-0003-1282-9978; Connell, Sean D/0000-0002-5350-6852; Falkenberg, Laura/0000-0002-5868-2310",ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council; APA,"We thank volunteers, including members of the Southern Seas Ecology Laboratories, who assisted with the collection of algae and grazers as well as those involved with the assembly and maintenance of experimental mesocosms.

Currently operational forecasts are issued publicly for rolling 3-month periods at lead-times of 0 or 1 month, usually without an indication of forecast quality. The short lag between the predictor and predictand limits use of forecasts because pastoralists operating large properties have insufficient time to implement key management decisions. The ability to forecast rainfall based on the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) phase system was examined at 0-5-month lead-times for Australian rainfall. The SOI phase system provided a shift of adequate magnitude in the rainfall probabilities (-40 to +30%) and forecast quality for the 5-month austral warm season at lead-times >0 months. When data used to build the forecast system were used in verification, >20% of locations had a significant linear error in probability space (LEPS) and Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test for lead-times of 0-2 months. The majority of locations showing forecast quality were in northern Australia (north of 25 degrees S), predominately in north-eastern Australia (north of 25 degrees S, east of 140 degrees E).

This is the basis of the SAR method that has been used to forecast large numbers of species committed to extinction every year due to deforestation. The method has a number of issues that must be handled with care to avoid error. These include the functional form of the SAR, the choice of equation parameters, the sampling procedure used, extinction debt, and forest regeneration. Concerns about the accuracy of the SAR technique often cite errors not much larger than the natural scatter of the SAR itself. Such errors do not undermine the credibility of forecasts predicting large numbers of extinctions, although they may be a serious obstacle in other SAR applications. Very large errors can arise from misinterpretation of extinction debt, inappropriate functional form, and ignoring forest regeneration. Major challenges remain to understand better the relationship between sampling protocol and the functional form of SARs and the dynamics of relaxation, especially in continental areas, and to widen the testing of extinction forecasts.",,,,"Monokrousos, Nikolaos/AAE-4000-2020","Monokrousos, Nikolaos/0000-0001-5465-5588",,,,,15,16,0,41,,,,0077-8923,,978-1-57331-883-9,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2013,1286,,,,,,50,61,,10.1111/nyas.12073,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000324894500004,23672586,,,,

Theory and case studies suggest that indirect effects associated with species interactions may alter these direct responses. How can we tractably predict in which cases indirect effects are likely to be important and appropriately model the interaction of abiotic and biotic drivers? One viable strategy is to characterize partitioning between species along thermal, temporal, and spatial niche axes. The partitioning can be informed by assessing functional traits. Mechanistic models can then be applied to predict how climate change will alter niche partitioning. I illustrate this approach by asking whether competition has altered the responses of Caribbean Anolis lizards to recent warming and find that forested habitat has become more suitable for a warm-adapted, open species, and less suitable for a cool-adapted forest inhabitant. Competition may result in competitive displacement of the cool-adapted species as the warm-adapted species moves into the forest.

After validation, a lagrangian transport model was coupled to the hydrodynamic model to study and compare the transport patterns of three different classes of organo-mineral aggregates along the Nazare canyon. The results show that the transport in the canyon is neither constant, nor unidirectional and that there are preferential areas where deposited matter is resuspended and redistributed. The transport of the larger class size of organo-mineral aggregates (2000 mu m and 4000 mu m) is less pronounced, and a decrease in the phytodetrital carbon flux along the canyon is observed. During the modelled period, the Nazare canyon acts as a depocentre of sedimentary organic matter rather than a conduit of organo-mineral aggregates to the deep sea, as has been reported by other authors.

In this study, we examined how changes in ocean temperature and associated nitrate concentrations driven by the strengthening of the East Australian Current (EAC) will influence the morphology, reproduction and development of the widespread kelp Ecklonia radiata in southeastern Australia. E. radiata morphology and reproduction were examined at sites in New South Wales (NSW) and Tasmania, where sea surface temperature differs by similar to 5 degrees C, and a laboratory experiment was conducted to test the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on E. radiata development. E. radiata size and amount of reproductive tissue were generally greater in the cooler waters of Tasmania compared to NSW. Importantly, one morphological trait (lamina length) was a strong predictor of the amount of reproductive tissue, suggesting that morphological changes in response to increased temperature may influence reproductive capacity in E. radiata. Growth of gametophytes was optimum between 15 and 22 degrees C and decreased by >50% above 22 degrees C. Microscopic sporophytes were also largest between 15 and 22 C, but no sporophytes developed above 22 degrees C, highlighting a potentially critical upper temperature threshold for E. radiata in Tasmania. Lower nitrate concentration had no effect on E. radiata gametophytes and sporophytes.

Mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) data from ERA-40 and ERA-Interim data sets produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and mean temperature in the core of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) at the Sorkapp Section along 76.3 degrees N were used to explain the variability of the maximum temperature. A correlation analysis confirmed previous findings, showing that variability in the oceanography of the fjords can be explained mainly by two external factors: AW temperature variability in the WSC and regional patterns of the wind stress field. To take both processes into consideration, a multiple regression model accounting for temperature in the WSC core and MSLP over the area was developed.

Multi-stage demographic approaches, where plant recruitment is explored across multiple and consecutive stages, are essential to obtain a whole overview of the consequences of increasing aridity on tree recruitment and forest dynamics, but they are still rarely used. In this study, we present the results of an experimental rainfall exclusion aimed to evaluate the impact of projected increasing drought on multiple stage-specific probabilities of recruitment in a key tree species typical of late-successional Mediterranean woodlands (Quercus ilex L.). We calibrated linear and nonlinear likelihood models for the different demographic processes and calculated overall probabilities of recruitment along a wide range of microhabitat conditions. Rainfall exclusion altered Q. ilex recruitment throughout ontogeny. Seed maturation, seedling emergence and survival and, to a lesser extent, post-dispersal seed survival were the most sensitive demographic processes to decreased rainfall. Interestingly, both the identity of the most critical stages for recruitment and their specific sensitivity to rainfall manipulation depended largely on the yearly pattern of precipitation. The microhabitat heterogeneity strongly determined the success of recruitment in the study species. The experimental increase in drought displaced the peak of maximum overall recruitment towards the low end of the light gradient, suggesting that the dependence on shrubs for an effective recruitment in Q ilex could be intensified under future environmental scenarios. In terms of phenotypic plasticity, Q. ilex seedlings responded more strongly to light availability than to experimentally increased drought, which could reduce its ability to persist under on-going environmental conditions due to climate change. Results from this study provide a full picture of the ecological and functional consequences of the projected rainfall reduction on tree recruitment and forest dynamics in two years of contrasting precipitation.

Mesocosms, experimental enclosures designed to approximate natural conditions, and in which environmental factors can be manipulated and closely monitored, provide a powerful tool to close the gap between small-scale laboratory experiments and observational and correlative approaches applied in field surveys. Existing pelagic mesocosm systems are stationary and/or restricted to well-protected waters. To allow mesocosm experimentation in a range of hydrographic conditions and in areas considered most sensitive to ocean change, we developed a mobile sea-going mesocosm facility, the Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Future Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS). The KOSMOS platform, which can be transported and deployed by mid-sized research vessels, is designed for operation in moored and free-floating mode under low to moderate wave conditions (up to 2.5m wave heights). It encloses a water column 2m in diameter and 15 to 25m deep (similar to 50-75 m(3) in volume) without disrupting the vertical structure or disturbing the enclosed plankton community. Several new developments in mesocosm design and operation were implemented to (i) minimize differences in starting conditions between mesocosms, (ii) allow for extended experimental duration, (iii) precisely determine the mesocosm volume, (iv) determine air-sea gas exchange, and (v) perform mass balance calculations. After multiple test runs in the Baltic Sea, which resulted in continuous improvement of the design and handling, the KOSMOS platform successfully completed its first full-scale experiment in the high Arctic off Svalbard (78 degrees 56.2'N, 11 degrees 53.6'E) in June/July 2010. The study, which was conducted in the framework of the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA), focused on the effects of ocean acidification on a natural plankton community and its impacts on biogeochemical cycling and air-sea exchange of climate-relevant gases. This manuscript describes the mesocosm hardware, its deployment and handling, CO2 manipulation, sampling and cleaning, including some further modifications conducted based on the experiences gained during this study.",,,,"Boxhammer, Tim/AAE-6416-2020; Schulz, Kai/Q-5608-2017; Riebesell, Ulf/AAC-9717-2020","Boxhammer, Tim/0000-0002-9632-5947; Schulz, Kai/0000-0002-8481-4639; Riebesell, Ulf/0000-0002-9442-452X","GEOMARHelmholtz Association; integrated project SOPRAN (Surface Ocean PRocesses in the ANthropocene); German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [211384, 228224]","The design, construction and field testing of the KOSMOS mesocosms was made possible through financial support of GEOMAR and the integrated project SOPRAN (Surface Ocean PRocesses in the ANthropocene) funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF).

By further projecting such models under 2100 future climate scenarios, we here estimated the predicted trends in invasion risk related to climate change. We performed eight different modelling techniques within an ensemble forecast framework using presence data from the native and the invaded ranges. We predicted an increase in the climatic suitability for the species in the Northern hemisphere, especially close to the already invaded range in Europe, in Spain and in Central and Eastern Europe - from Switzerland to Hungary up to Southern Sweden. Climate change should also increase the invasion risk in the United States except along the Eastern coast. Scenarios for future climates include predictions from five global circulation models and three special reports on emission scenarios. Standard deviations of the results obtained from the 13 different climate scenarios confirmed the low uncertainty of models to predict an increase in invasion risk across Central and Eastern Europe, close to the already invaded European range. These regions hold among the highest densities of bee-hives in Europe, and could suffer from the potential predation of the putative invading hornet on pollinators. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This necessitates revisiting site prioritization and species protection for conservation. Patterns of richness and threat of four well-studied aquatic taxa, the fishes, crabs, molluscs and dragonflies largely coincide at the continental scale, at least in Africa. For this study, we focus on dragonflies, for which there is a point locality database, as a surrogate taxon, modeling the species at the fine-scale, using species distribution modeling. With this approach, we built a protected areas network using spatial planning software. Priority areas for dragonfly conservation largely coincided with analyses of global biodiversity hotspots. The Zambian swamps and woodlands, as well as the rainforests of the Lower Guinea and Congo Basin are emphasized as hotspots of dragonfly diversity. Among globally threatened species, 72% were recorded at least once in a protected area. Although the current reserve network covers 10.7% of the landscape, the proportional representation of species geographic distributions in reserves is only 1.2%. The reserve network is therefore inefficient concerning freshwater species, and many areas of conservation priority that are not formally protected remain. The advantage of operating at the fine scale, while covering a large geographic area is that it shifts the focus from the large-scale hotspots to smaller priority areas within and beyond hotspots. Also, by operating at the fine-scale for a large geographical area, the potential exists for local conservation managers to consider campaigning for the inclusion of the priority areas that are not formally protected, while adjacent to the existing reserve networks. Where this is not possible, we recommend monitoring these areas to detect future threats to the habitats that these might face. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have tried to predict the responses of bats to climate change. The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) is a federally listed endangered species that is found in the eastern United States. The northerly distribution of Indiana bat summer maternity colonies relative to their winter distributions suggests that warmer climates may result in a shift in their summer distribution. Our objectives were to determine the climatic factors associated with Indiana bat maternity range and forecast changes in the amount and distribution of the range under future climates. We used Maxent to model the suitable climatic habitat of Indiana bats under current conditions and four future climate forecasts for 202130, 203140, 204150, and 205160. Average maximum temperature across the maternity season (MayAugust) was the most important variable in the model of current distribution of Indiana bat maternity colonies with suitability decreasing considerably above 28 degrees C. The areal extent of the summer maternity distribution of Indiana bats was forecasted to decline and be concentrated in the northeastern United States and Appalachian Mountains; the western part of the current maternity range (Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio) was forecasted to become climatically unsuitable under most future climates. Our models suggest that high temperatures may be a factor in roost-site selection at the regional scale and in the future, may also be an important variable at the microhabitat scale. When behavioral changes fail to mitigate the effects of high temperature, range shifts are likely to occur. Thus, habitat management for Indiana bat maternity colonies in the northeastern United States and Appalachian Mountains of the Southeast is critical as these areas will most likely serve as climatic refugia.",,,,,,,,,,9,10,1,117,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the lack of scientific knowledge about short-term ecosystem responses to climate change has made it difficult to define set conservation practices or to realistically inform ecosystem models. Until recently, the main goal for ecologists was to study the composition and structure of communities and their implications for ecosystem function, but due to the probable magnitude and irreversibility of climate-change effects (species extinctions and loss of ecosystem function), a shorter term focus on responses of ecosystems to climate change is needed. We highlight several underutilized approaches for studying the ecological consequences of climate change that capitalize on the natural variability of the climate system at different temporal and spatial scales. For example, studying organismal responses to extreme climatic events can inform about the resilience of populations to global warming and contribute to the assessment of local extinctions. Translocation experiments and gene expression are particular useful to quantify a species' acclimation potential to global warming. And studies along environmental gradients can guide habitat restoration and protection programs by identifying vulnerable species and sites. These approaches identify the processes and mechanisms underlying species acclimation to changing conditions, combine different analytical approaches, and can be used to improve forecasts of the short-term impacts of climate change and thus inform conservation practices and ecosystem models in a meaningful way.",,,,"Miller-Rushing, Abraham/D-5102-2009; Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019; Uriarte, Maria/L-8944-2013","Miller-Rushing, Abraham/0000-0003-3203-0143; Debinski, Diane/0000-0002-7144-4640; Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414; Latimer, Andrew/0000-0001-8098-0448",,,,,21,22,1,163,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We perform this analysis on data from a measurement campaign in the city of Aarhus (Denmark) using three pollen traps and by comparing these observations with a novel inventory of grass pollen sources. The source inventory is based on a new methodology developed for urban-scale grass pollen sources. The new methodology is believed to be generally applicable for the European area, as it relies on commonly available remote sensing data combined with management information for local grass areas. The inventory has identified a number of grass pollen source areas present within the city domain. The comparison of the measured pollen concentrations with the inventory shows that the atmospheric concentrations of grass pollen in the urban zone reflect the source areas identified in the inventory, and that the pollen sources that are found to affect the pollen levels are located near or within the city domain. The results also show that during days with peak levels of pollen concentrations there is no correlation between the three urban traps and an operational trap located just 60 km away. This finding suggests that during intense flowering, the grass pollen concentration mirrors the local source distribution and is thus a local-scale phenomenon. Model simulations aimed at assessing population exposure to pollen levels are therefore recommended to take into account both local sources and local atmospheric transport, and not to rely only on describing regional to long-range transport of pollen. The derived pollen source inventory can be entered into local-scale atmospheric transport models in combination with other components that simulate pollen release in order to calculate urban-scale variations in the grass pollen load. The gridded inventory with a resolution of 14m is therefore made available as supplementary material to this paper, and the verifying grass pollen observations are additionally available in tabular form.",,,,"Geels, Camilla/G-4757-2013; Becker, Thomas/K-4255-2015; Hertel, Ole/L-4346-2013","Geels, Camilla/0000-0003-2549-1750; Becker, Thomas/0000-0002-5193-4044; Hertel, Ole/0000-0003-0972-7735; Sigsgaard, Torben/0000-0002-2043-7571; Skjoth, Carsten Ambelas/0000-0001-5992-9568; Bonlokke, Jakob Hjort/0000-0002-8247-6576; Schlunssen, Vivi/0000-0003-4915-1734",Aarhus University Research Foundation as a part of the A3 research centre; VKR-Foundation,"This work was partly funded by the Aarhus University Research Foundation as a part of the A3 research centre and an individual post doc grant from the VKR-Foundation to Carsten Ambelas Skjoth.

We investigated impacts of increased streamwater temperatures on sediment fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and sulfate. Experiments were conducted at 8 long-term monitoring sites across land use (forest, agricultural, suburban, and urban) at the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Over 20 yr of routine water temperature data showed substantial variation across seasons and years. Lab incubations of sediment and overlying water were conducted at 4 temperatures (4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) for 48 h. Results indicated: (1) warming significantly increased sediment DOC fluxes to overlying water across land use but decreased DOC quality via increases in the humic-like to protein-like fractions, (2) warming consistently increased SRP fluxes from sediments to overlying water across land use, (3) warming increased sulfate fluxes from sediments to overlying water at rural/suburban sites but decreased sulfate fluxes at some urban sites likely due to sulfate reduction, and (4) nitrate fluxes showed an increasing trend with temperature at some forest and urban sites but with larger variability than SRP. Sediment fluxes of nitrate, SRP and sulfate were strongly related to watershed urbanization and organic matter content. Using relationships of sediment fluxes with temperature, we estimate a 5 degrees C warming would increase mean sediment fluxes of SRP, DOC and nitrate-N across streams by 0.27-1.37 gm(-2) yr(-1), 0.03-0.14 kgm(-2) yr(-1), and 0.001-0.06 kgm(-2) yr(-1). Understanding warming impacts on coupled biogeochemical cycles in streams (e. g., organic matter mineralization, P sorption, nitrification, denitrification, and sulfate reduction) is critical for forecasting shifts in carbon and nutrient loads in response to interactive impacts of climate and land use change.",,,,"Kaushal, Sujay/G-1062-2013","Kaushal, Sujay/0000-0003-0834-9189","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI 0640300, CBET 1058502]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NASA NNX11AM28G]; Maryland Sea Grant Awards [SA7528085-U, R/WS-2, NA05OAR4171042]; Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER project [NSF DEB-0423476]","This research was supported by NSF Awards DBI 0640300 and CBET 1058502, NASA grant NASA NNX11AM28G, Maryland Sea Grant Awards SA7528085-U, R/WS-2 and NA05OAR4171042, and Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER project (NSF DEB-0423476).

A major sink for atmospheric CO2, and a key source of biological resources, the World Ocean is widely anticipated to undergo profound physical and - via ocean acidification - chemical changes as direct and indirect results of these emissions. Given strong biophysical coupling, the marine biota is also expected to experience strong changes in response to this anthropogenic forcing. Here we examine the large-scale response of ocean biogeochemistry to climate and acidification impacts during the 21st century for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 using an intermediate complexity global ecosystem model, MEDUSA-2.0. The primary impact of future change lies in stratification-led declines in the availability of key nutrients in surface waters, which in turn leads to a global decrease (1990s vs. 2090s) in ocean productivity (-6.3 %). This impact has knock-on consequences for the abundance of the low trophic level biogeochemical actors modelled by MEDUSA-2.0 (-5.8 %), and these would be expected to similarly impact higher trophic level elements such as fisheries. Related impacts are found in the flux of organic material to seafloor communities (-40.7% at 1000 m), and in the volume of ocean suboxic zones (+12.5 %). A sensitivity analysis removing an acidification feedback on calcification finds that change in this process significantly impacts benthic communities, suggesting that a better understanding of the OA-sensitivity of calcifying organisms, and their role in ballasting sinking organic carbon, may significantly improve fore-casting of these ecosystems. For all processes, there is geographical variability in change - for instance, productivity declines -21% in the Atlantic and increases +59% in the Arctic - and changes are much more pronounced under RCP 8.5 than the RCP 2.6 scenario.",,,,"Popova, Ekaterina E/B-4520-2012; Anderson, Thomas/K-5487-2012; Yool, Andrew/B-4799-2012","Popova, Ekaterina E/0000-0002-2012-708X; Anderson, Thomas/0000-0002-7408-1566; Yool, Andrew/0000-0002-9879-2776","Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)NERC Natural Environment Research Council; NERC UK Ocean Acidification research programme (UKOA) [NE/H017372/1]; European Union Seventh Framework Programme EURO-BASINEuropean Union (EU) [ENV.2010.2.2.1-1, 264933]; Joint DECC/Defra Met.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a native perennial herbaceous grass, is a promising candidate for cellulosic feedstock production. In this study, current and future (from 2080 to 2090) productivity is estimated across the central and eastern United States using ALMANAC, a mechanistic model that simulates plant growth over time. The ALMANAC model was parameterized for representative ecotypes of switchgrass. Our results indicate substantial variation in switchgrass productivity both within regions and over time. States along the Gulf Coast, southern Atlantic Coast, and in the East North Central Midwest have the highest current biomass potential. However, these areas also contain critical wetland habitat necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and agricultural lands necessary for food production. The southern United States is predicted to have the largest decrease in future biomass production. The Great Plains are expected to experience large increases in productivity by 2080-2090 due to climate change. In general, regions where future temperature and precipitation are predicted to increase are also where larger future biomass production is expected. In contrast, regions that show a future decrease in precipitation are associated with smaller future biomass production. Switchgrass appears to be a promising biofuel crop for the central and eastern United States, with local biomass predicted to be high (>10 Mg/ha) for similar to 50% of the area studied for each climate scenario. In order to minimize land conversion and loss of biodiversity, areas that currently have and maintain high productivity under climate change should be targeted for their long-term growth potential.",,,,,,Plant Genome Research ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [NSF IOS-0922457],We thank two anonymous reviewers for comments on the manuscript.

In this study, a laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate C mineralization of residues of soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), and their mixture placed on the soil surface and incorporated into the soils in a Mollisol in northeast China. Both the residue type and placement significantly affected C and N mineralization, while no significant interactions between them were observed on cumulative C mineralization. The soybean residue had a higher decomposition rate than the maize residue regardless of their placements; decomposition rates for both soybean and maize residues placed on the soil surface were higher than those of the same residues incorporated into the soils. Moreover, non-additive effects on the contribution of each residue type to C mineralization of the residue mixture were not observed. Our results suggest that crop residue with a low N concentration and a high C/N ratio (such as maize) can be incorporated into soils to immobilize N and decrease CO2 emissions in comparison with crop residue placed on the soil surface.

The enclosed coastal water bodies are the areas of the intensive pollution and in the same time have the limited water exchange with the main basin. The objective of the study is the development of the method of forecasting of the port water quality and recommendations on the required water quality supply. The protection of the water quality in the yachting ports is very actual problem because the water quality is not only environmental but also the consuming property of the marinas. The study has been carried out for the conditions of the yachting port ""Grand-Marina Sochi"", which is designed for placing in the sea port Sochi, Russian Black Sea coast. The capacity of marina is 300 yachts; the water area of marina is bounded by construction of the additional breakwater in the main sea port. The discharges of the oil, as well as the accidence at the sewage system are considered like the sources of the pollution. The numerical modeling of current pattern has been applied to forecast the spreading of the pollution under the determined hydrometeorological scenarios. 3D circulation of the currents inside and in the gate of the marina is modeled by application of the SELFE-code - the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations on the unstructured grids. To simulate the dynamics and evolution of the oil spill the 3D OILTOX-code is used. The both codes have been developed in Ukrainian Center of Ecological and Water Projects. The system dynamic model of the water quality evolution has been designed on the base of PowerSim program, and applied to simulate the changes of the water quality parameters after sewage system damage. Three meteorological scenarios with the wind velocity, 5, 10, and 15 m/s have been considered. It was shown that the currents have the 3D structure with the surface velocities following wind direction, and near-bottom velocities having the opposite direction. The oil spill dynamics simulated using the Lagrange approach, the total volume of the discharged oil is taking as 500 liters, the time of discharge is 10 minutes, the number of model Lagrange tracers is 6200. As the result, the time of reaching by the oil the coastline ( breakwater or port mole) has been obtained. That should be included to the planned measures of the water quality protection system. The analysis of the sources of pollution of the Sochi sea port resulted that the main source is the surface rain water discharge. That gives the main input of the organic matters to the sea water. The main mechanism of the cleaning of the water body is the water exchange between marina and the Black sea. It's shown the evolution of the water quality as the result of the chemical reactions and the flushing by water exchange.

Theoretically, predictions of recruitment should be better when they are based on estimates of cohort size taken close to the age of recruitment and may improve if the effects of environmental factors that influence pre-recruit mortality are accounted for. In practice, measurement error and difficulties in establishing robust recruitment-environment relationships complicate the picture. For 5 fish stocks of 4 species in 3 ecosystems, we examined the usefulness of indices of juvenile abundance relative to larval abundance for predicting recruitment. Further, we examined whether the use of environmental covariates improved predictions. For 2 of 4 stocks with sufficient data (1 stock did not have larval data), juvenile abundance was a better predictor of recruitment compared to larval indices. For the 2 other stocks, we found that juvenile indices were not superior to larval indices, possibly because of error in the measurement of juvenile abundance. In all 5 of these stocks, regression analysis showed that inclusion of environmental correlates contributed significantly to explaining recruitment variation compared to models based on juvenile indices alone. Further, cross validation showed that forecasts of future recruitment were either improved or qualitatively unchanged by including environmental correlates. This was despite apparent nonstationarity in the recruitment-environment relationships; most of the environmental variables and pre-recruit abundance indices were significantly correlated with recruitment for only parts of the studied period. Such complex responses to environmental changes are difficult to anticipate, yet the environmental information should not be ignored altogether.",,,,"Stige, Leif Christian/P-6806-2015; Hunt, George/V-9423-2019; Yaragina, Natalia/D-2618-2019","Stige, Leif Christian/0000-0002-6808-1383; Yaragina, Natalia/0000-0003-0621-9065; Hunt, George/0000-0001-8709-2697",Research Council of Norway (RCN) through the MICOResearch Council of Norway; RCN through the ADMAR; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); CAMEO,"We thank The Research Council of Norway (RCN) for funding the workshop Tropharct through the MICO project (Match/Mismatch and Ecosystem).

Bycatch analyses that use fishery-dependent data only reflect the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of turtles and fishing effort and therefore do not directly reveal conditions associated with turtle distributions. Fishery-independent and -dependent data can be used together to identify environmental conditions associated with turtle presence and the subsequent risk of a bycatch encounter if fishing effort is present. We developed generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe fishery-independent encounter rates of loggerheads observed in aerial and resource surveys in the US mid-Atlantic region as a function of environmental variables. We then fit a fishery-independent GAM to fishery-dependent data collected from commercial gillnet, bottom trawl, and scallop dredge fisheries in the mid-Atlantic region, and tested the model on new fishery-dependent data to assess how well the model predicted bycatch events. The preferred model describes fishery-independent encounter rates as a function of latitude, sea-surface temperature, depth, and salinity.

Ectotherms may be particularly sensitive to changes in thermal regimes, and tropical ectotherms are more likely than temperate species to be influenced by changes in environmental temperature, because they may have evolved narrow thermal tolerances. Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii) are tropical, oviparous reptiles. To quantify the effects of temperature on the morphology and physiology of hatchling keelbacks, clutches laid by wild-caught females were split and incubated at three temperatures, reflecting the average minimum, overall average and average maximum temperatures recorded at our study site. Upon hatching, the performance of neonates was examined at all three incubation temperatures in a randomized order over consecutive days. Hatchlings from the 'hot' treatment had slower burst swim speeds and swam fewer laps than hatchlings from the cooler incubation temperatures in all three test temperatures, indicating a low thermal optimum for incubation of this tropical species. There were no significant interactions between test temperature and incubation temperature across performance variables, suggesting phenotypic differences caused by incubation temperature did not acclimate this species to post-hatching conditions. Thus, keelback embryos appear evolutionarily adapted to development at cooler temperatures (relative to what is available in their habitat). The considerable reduction in hatchling viability and performance associated with a 3.5 A degrees C increase in incubation temperature, suggests climate change may have significant population-level effects on this species. However, the offspring of three mothers exposed to the hottest incubation temperature were apparently resilient to high temperature, suggesting that this species may respond to selection imposed by thermal regime.",,,,"Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012; Blomberg, Simone P/B-7613-2008","Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X; Blomberg, Simone P/0000-0003-1062-0839; Bell, Kristian/0000-0002-1857-6257",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,"We thank Teresea Lambrick, Gus McNab, Ross Gottlieb, Joel Voiselle, John Llewelyn and Matthew Crowther for their assistance in the field and laboratory.

Despite this uncertainty, closely related species are often assumed to be ecologically similar. This principle has led to the proposed use of phylogenetic information in forecasting species responses to environmental change. Tests of niche conservatism often focus on 'functional traits' and environmental tolerances, but there have been limited tests for conservatism in species' responses to changes in the environment, especially in the field. The prevalence of functional convergence and the likelihood of functional trade-offs in a heterogeneous environment suggest that conservatism of the response niche is unlikely to be detectable under natural conditions. To test the relevance of evolutionary information in predicting ecological responses, we tested for conservatism (measured as phylogenetic signal) of grassland plant population responses to 14 treatments (e.g. light, nutrients, water, enemies, mutualists), each manipulated for 2-3 years, and 4 treatment categories (aboveground, belowground, resource, and herbivory) at a single site. Individual treatment responses showed limited evidence of conservatism, with only weak conservatism in plant responses to mycorrhizae and grazing. Aspects of the response niche were conserved among monocots both aboveground and belowground, although the pattern varied. Conservatism was limited to grazing aboveground, but belowground responses were conserved as a group, suggesting fundamental differences in how selection has led to niche conservatism in aboveground and belowground environments. Overall, our results suggest that conservatism of the response niche is not common, but is actually rare. As such, evolutionary relationships are likely to be of limited relevance for predicting species responses under field conditions, at least over the short time scales used in this study.

The intertidal limpet Patella rustica Linnaeus, 1758, is a warm-water species whose changes in distribution have been related to the recent warming off northern Portugal. Here we analyse the effects of the severe winter of 2008/2009 on the demographic structure of P. rustica, with the objectives of reassessing its geographical distribution and testing the mechanisms underlying the establishment of range limits. In addition, three decades of sea surface temperature were analysed, providing information on the thermal context contemporaneous to the distributional changes. Despite the cold winter of 2008/2009, the abundance of P. rustica increased in the study area, showing that the previously reported changes on the distribution of this species were not ephemeral. The demographic analyses suggested that even though early life stages are probably affected by extreme low winter temperatures, adults are less sensitive, with important consequences for the resilience of marginal populations and the fluctuations of distributional ranges. These results emphasise the importance of considering the demographic consequences of thermal stress when trying to understand and forecast the effects of climate change on biogeography and biodiversity.

We evaluated the hypothesis that juvenile thermal tolerance determines northern range in gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), a species commonly caught as juveniles along the US Atlantic coast well north of their adult distribution, using a combined laboratory, field and modeling approach. The cumulative degree days below 17 degrees C (CDD<17) survived by individuals maintained in the laboratory under ambient seasonal cooling conditions were used to quantify the chronic effects of prolonged but non-lethal low temperatures. Under ambient conditions, juveniles stopped feeding below 11.3 degrees C, and the mean temperature at death was 10.2 degrees C (+/-0.74 S.D.). The CDD<17 endured by individuals ranged from 61.9 to 138.8 (8354+/-22.44 S.D.), and was positively related to fish size. The relation between CDD<17 and fish size was extrapolated to the maximum juvenile size in fall to provide an upper limit for survival in the wild (CDD<17 = 210 days). Acute low temperature tolerance was evaluated in a second experiment that exposed juveniles to a constant rate of temperature decline (3 degrees C where feeding ceased at 10.3 degrees C and death occurred at 7.0 degrees C (+/-0.45 S.D.). These thermal thresholds were combined with winter estuarine temperature data at 12 sites to evaluate potential overwinter survival along the US Atlantic coast. Of a total of 134 site-year combinations categorized based on the acute and chronic thresholds, the CDD<17 threshold (>210 days) was more limiting than the acute threshold (minimum daily temperature<7.0 degrees C) to survival of juveniles for a given site-year. To evaluate the relationship between juvenile thermal tolerance criteria and adult distributions, we quantified adult distribution using field observations in the western Atlantic Ocean compiled from a database of recreational divers. There was a strong correspondence between observations of adult gray snapper from the database of recreational divers vs. latitude with that of the predicted survival of juveniles vs. latitude from our analysis. The agreement between the laboratory-derived thermal tolerance metrics, the spatial distribution of winter temperature, and the distribution of adult gray snapper support the hypothesis that the adult range of gray snapper is largely limited by the overwinter survival of juveniles. Understanding the interaction between physiology and range is important for forecasting the impacts of climate change on other species of fish where juvenile tolerances are critical in determining range, particularly in seasonal systems.

Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here, we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces-a statistical error often known as the prosecutor's fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false-positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than those more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely.",,,,"Hastings, Alan/O-6864-2019","Hastings, Alan/0000-0002-0717-8026; Boettiger, Carl/0000-0002-1642-628X",NSF grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF 0742674]; Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship from the Department of Energy grant [DE-FG02-97ER25308]; NERSC Supercomputing grant [DE-AC02-05CH11231],"This research was supported by funding from NSF grant EF 0742674 to A.H. and a Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship from the Department of Energy grant DE-FG02-97ER25308 and NERSC Supercomputing grant DE-AC02-05CH11231 to C.B.

However, if their future distribution can be predicted, effective control measures can be scheduled beforehand to prevent the onset of damage. In this study, we predicted the future range expansion of recolonising wild boar Sus scrofa populations in the Chiba Prefecture, Japan, using simulations. Wild boars were extinct in the Chiba Prefecture until the 1970s, but since then, a new naturalised population has spread, probably due to release for hunting. Recently a small, isolated, naturalised population was found in the northern part of the prefecture, which was considered to be a new release. We divided the Chiba Prefecture (5,156 km(2)) into 3-km grids and, based on nuisance control records, we examined the 'presence' of wild boar populations from 2002 to 2007 and in 2010. We simultaneously estimated habitat suitability and dispersal probability of the source population via range-expasion modelling. We predicted the future distribution by the use of stochastic simulations for 20 years after 2010. According to the simulations, the wild boar populations will expand into the southern and northern regions of the Chiba Prefecture at a rate of 2,153 km/year, and crop damage should be expected in these areas in the future. Range expansion into the northern region of the prefecture will be completed by around 2025. If the northern isolated population is removed, it will be possible to delay the range expansion for about five years.

A fixed effect panel data specification is used to control for the heterogeneity in the data. Mean-while, spatial autocorrelation is also diagnosed by a statistical methodology that allows us to split the model in subsamples (clusters) of more homogenous municipalities. The clustering analysis shows that there are three clusters whose land-use patterns are strongly different in an economical point of view. The first cluster identifies municipalities dedicated to logging, natural resources exploitation and slash-and-burn cultures; the second cluster shows a more diversified agriculture; while the third cluster presents very developed intensive agriculture municipalities. Another contribution of this article relies on the assessment of contemporaneous causal relation among distinct land-uses areas. This new approach allows us to evaluate the dynamics relations arisen from unexpected innovations in the process of soil occupation. The impulse response functions (IRF) and the forecast error variance decompositions (FEVD) generate the following results: (1) in the opposition direction of previous studies, we find that the demand for cropping does not require to clear new areas of forest.; (2) contrary to previous studies we do not find indication that cattle ranching is the primary driver of deforestation; (3) the impact of a shock of pasture land on itself is virtually null at the initial stages, but increases over time, not requiring to clear extra areas of forest land but rather competing with crop land; (4) it seems that if not for all the Amazon Basin, at least in one cluster, cattle ranching and cropping could be competitive activities; and (5) we find out that in the long run pasture innovation is responsible for the major percent of the forecast error concern all land uses. It probably means that the destiny of distinct categories of land, in cluster one, is endogenously determine by activities connected to cattle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using assumptions for real household disposable income. real prices, 'exogenous non-economic factors' (ExNEF), average UK temperatures and GHG intensities, three future scenarios are constructed. In each scenario, real expenditure for almost all categories of UK expenditure continues to grow up to 2030: the exceptions being 'alcoholic beverages and tobacco' and 'other fuels' (and 'gas' and 'electricity' in the 'low' scenario) leading to an increase in associated GHG emissions for most of the categories in the 'reference' and 'high' scenarios other than 'food and non-alcoholic beverages', 'alcoholic beverages and tobacco', 'electricity', 'other fuels' and 'recreation and culture'. Of the future GHG emissions, about 30% is attributed to 'direct energy' use by households and nearly 70% attributable to 'indirect energy'. UK policy makers therefore need to consider a range of policies if they wish to curtail emissions associated with household expenditure, including, for example, economic measures such as taxes alongside measures that reflect the important contribution of ExNEF to changes in expenditure for most categories of consumption.

To date, there has been no long-term empirical evidence documenting the relative roles of climatic, epidemiological and biological factors in limiting life-history determinants of rabbit range and abundance. Using 12 years of capturemarkrecapture data from their exotic range in Australia, we constructed candidate CormackJollySeber models to test the influence of environmental, competition and disease conditions on rabbit survival and recruitment. Our results show that: (i) population-level disease infection rate has the largest overall impact on rabbit survival, explaining 80% of variance in survival rates; (ii) environmental as well as epidemiological conditions constrain rabbit survival, especially for younger animals; (iii) temporal variation in rabbit kitten recruitment patterns are best described by a combination of climate, competition and disease settings (accounting for 68% of variance), while temperature alone has a strong negative influence on kitten recruitment; and (iv) recruitment responds positively to rabbit haemorrhagic disease, but negatively to myxomatosis the former, probably being mediated through a disease driven effect on intraspecific competition for food. A strengthened understanding of climate change impacts on rabbit range and abundance can be achieved by accounting explicitly for potential synergisms between disease dynamics and climate. In this analysis, we provide the first step towards such an attempt for this important mammal species.

It has been postulated that climate warming may pose the greatest threat species in the tropics, where ectotherms have evolved more thermal specialist physiologies. Although species could rapidly respond to environmental change through adaptation, little is known about the potential for thermal adaptation, especially in tropical species. 2. In the light of the limited empirical evidence available and predictions from mutation-selection theory, we might expect tropical ectotherms to have limited genetic variance to enable adaptation. However, as a consequence of thermodynamic constraints, we might expect this disadvantage to be at least partially offset by a fitness advantage, that is, the hotter-is-better hypothesis. 3. Using an established quantitative genetics model and metabolic scaling relationships, we integrate the consequences of the opposing forces of thermal specialization and thermodynamic constraints on adaptive potential by evaluating extinction risk under climate warming. We conclude that the potential advantage of a higher maximal development rate can in theory more than offset the potential disadvantage of lower genetic variance associated with a thermal specialist strategy. 4.Quantitative estimates of extinction risk are fundamentally very sensitive to estimates of generation time and genetic variance. However, our qualitative conclusion that the relative risk of extinction is likely to be lower for tropical species than for temperate species is robust to assumptions regarding the effects of effective population size, mutation rate and birth rate per capita. 5. With a view to improving ecological forecasts, we use this modelling framework to review the sensitivity of our predictions to the model's underpinning theoretical assumptions and the empirical basis of macroecological patterns that suggest thermal specialization and fitness increase towards the tropics. We conclude by suggesting priority areas for further empirical research.",,,,,"Walters, Richard/0000-0002-9653-8512","European Science FoundationEuropean Science Foundation (ESF) [2570]; Swedish Research Council VRSwedish Research Council; Zoological Museum, Zurich","We thank Joel Kingsolver, the Editor Duncan Irschick, Associate Editor Art Woods and two anonymous referees for constructive comments on an earlier draft.

Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. However, Refuge water quality today is impacted by pumped stormwater inflows to the eutrophic and mineral-enriched 100-km canal, which circumscribes the wetland. Optimal management is a challenge and requires scientifically based predictive tools to assess and forecast the impacts of water management on Refuge water quality. In this research, we developed a compartment-based numerical model of hydrodynamics and water quality for the Refuge. Using the numerical model, we examined the dynamics in stage, water depth, discharge from hydraulic structures along the canal, and exchange flow among canal and marsh compartments. We also investigated the transport of chloride, sulfate and total phosphorus from the canal to the marsh interior driven by hydraulic gradients as well as biological removal of sulfate and total phosphorus. The model was calibrated and validated using long-term stage and water quality data (1995-2007). Statistical analysis indicates that the model is capable of capturing the spatial (from canal to interior marsh) gradients of constituents across the Refuge. Simulations demonstrate that flow from the eutrophic and mineral-enriched canal impacts chloride and sulfate in the interior marsh. In contrast, total phosphorus in the interior marsh shows low sensitivity to intrusion and dispersive transport. We conducted a rainfall-driven scenario test in which the pumped inflow concentrations of chloride, sulfate and total phosphorus were equal to rainfall concentrations (wet deposition). This test shows that pumped inflow is the dominant factor responsible for the substantially increased chloride and sulfate concentrations in the interior marsh. Therefore, the present day Refuge should not be classified as solely a rainfall-driven or ombrotrophic wetland. The model provides an effective screening tool for studying the impacts of various water management alternatives on water quality across the Refuge, and demonstrates the practicality of similarly modeling other wetland systems. As a general rule, modeling provides one component of a multi-faceted effort to provide technical support for ecosystem management decisions.

On the basis of such studies, ecological forecasting models predict that, in the absence of dispersal and resource barriers, many species will exhibit large shifts in abundance and geographic range in response to warming. However, species are composed of individual populations, which may be subject to different selection pressures and therefore may be differentially responsive to environmental change. Asystematic responses across populations and species to warming will alter ecological communities differently across space. Common garden experiments can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the causes of compositional and spatial variation in responses to warming. Such experiments are useful for determining if geographically separated populations and co-occurring species respond differently to warming, and they provide the opportunity to compare effects of warming on fitness (survivorship and reproduction). We exposed colonies of two common ant species in the eastern United States, Aphaenogaster rudis and Temnothorax curvispinosus, collected along a latitudinal gradient from Massachusetts to North Carolina, to growth chamber treatments that simulated current and projected temperatures in central Massachusetts and central North Carolina within the next century. Regardless of source location, colonies of A. rudis, a keystone seed disperser, experienced high mortality and low brood production in the warmest temperature treatment. Colonies of T. curvispinosus from cooler locations experienced increased mortality in the warmest rearing temperatures, but colonies from the warmest locales did not. Our results suggest that populations of some common species may exhibit uniform declines in response to warming across their geographic ranges, whereas other species will respond differently to warming in different parts of their geographic ranges. Our results suggest that differential responses of populations and species must be incorporated into projections of range shifts in a changing climate.",,,,"Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009; Dunn, Robert/B-1360-2013","Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731; Dunn, Robert/0000-0002-6030-4837; Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081",United States Department of Energy Program for Ecosystem ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); US DOE PERUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-08ER64510],"This work was funded by the United States Department of Energy Program for Ecosystem Research.; Funding was provided by a US DOE PER award (DE-FG02-08ER64510) to R.

We reviewed quantitative and scoring RAs, integrating > 300 publications into arguably the most rigorous quantitative RA framework currently existing, and mapping each study onto our framework, which combines Transport, Establishment, Abundance, Spread and Impact (TEASI). Quantitative models generally measured single risk components (78% of studies), often focusing on Establishment alone (79%). Although dominant in academia, quantitative RAs are underused in policy, and should be made more accessible. Accommodating heterogeneous limited data, combining across risk components, and developing generalised RAs across species, space and time without requiring new models for each species may increase attractiveness for policy applications. Comparatively, scoring approaches covered more risk components (50% examined > 3 components), with Impact being the most common component (87%), and have been widely applied in policy (> 57%), but primarily employed expert opinion.

Location AdourGaronne River Basin (France). Methods We first applied an ensemble modelling approach to project annually the future distribution of 18 fish species for the 2010-2100 period on 50 sites. We then explored the spatial and temporal patterns of beta diversity by distinguishing between its two additive components, namely species turnover and nestedness. Results Taxonomic homogenization of fish assemblages was projected to increase linearly over the 21st century, especially in the downstream parts of the river gradient. This homogenization process was almost entirely caused by a decrease in spatial species turnover. When considering the temporal dimension of beta diversity, our results reveal an overall pattern of decreasing beta diversity along the upstreamdownstream river gradient. In contrast, when considering the turnover and nestedness components of temporal beta diversity we found significant U-shaped and hump-shaped relationships, respectively. Main conclusions Future climate change is projected to modify the taxonomic composition of freshwater fish assemblages by increasing their overall similarity over the AdourGaronne River Basin. Our findings suggest that the distinction between the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity is not only crucial for understanding the processes shaping spatial beta-diversity patterns but also for identifying localities where the rates of species replacement are projected to be greatest. Specifically we recommend that future conservation studies should not only consider the spatial component of beta diversity but also its dynamic caused by climate warming.",,,,"Leprieur, Fabien/C-4430-2008; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019",,EurolimpacsEuropean Union (EU) [505540]; Biofresh [226874]; 6th Framework European project; 7th Framework European project; GIS REGYNA project,"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their important comments and suggestions.

This is because sourcesink population dynamics cause species to occupy unsuitable environments, and because environmental change creates non-equilibrium situations in which species may be absent from suitable environments (due to migration limitation) or present in unsuitable environments that were previously suitable (due to time-delayed extinction). Because correlative species distribution models do not account for these processes, they are likely to produce biased niche estimates and biased forecasts of future range dynamics. Recently developed dynamic range models (DRMs) overcome this problem: they statistically estimate both range dynamics and the underlying environmental response of demographic rates from species distribution data. This process-based statistical approach qualitatively advances biogeographical analyses. Yet, the application of DRMs to a broad range of species and study systems requires substantial research efforts in statistical modelling, empirical data collection and ecological theory. Here we review current and potential contributions of these fields to a demographic understanding of niches and range dynamics. Our review serves to formulate a demographic research agenda that entails: (1) advances in incorporating process-based models of demographic responses and range dynamics into a statistical framework, (2) systematic collection of data on temporal changes in distribution and abundance and on the response of demographic rates to environmental variation, and (3) improved theoretical understanding of the scaling of demographic rates and the dynamics of spatially coupled populations. This demographic research agenda is challenging but necessary for improved comprehension and quantification of niches and range dynamics. It also forms the basis for understanding how niches and range dynamics are shaped by evolutionary dynamics and biotic interactions. Ultimately, the demographic research agenda should lead to deeper integration of biogeography with empirical and theoretical ecology.",,,,"Schroder, Boris/B-7211-2009; Midgley, Guy F./H-3585-2014; Pagel, Joern/A-9897-2012; Groeneveld, Juergen/N-2420-2016; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/K-3973-2012; O'Hara, Bob/A-7499-2008; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Linder, Hans Peter/F-5316-2010; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Schroder, Boris/N-7250-2019","Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Midgley, Guy F./0000-0001-8264-0869; Pagel, Joern/0000-0002-4817-1920; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/0000-0002-0116-220X; O'Hara, Bob/0000-0001-9737-3724; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Singer, Alexander/0000-0002-2777-3789","German Research Foundation DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHU 2259/3-1, SCHU 2259/5-1, SCHR1000/6-1]; European Research Council ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [233066]; Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation [VKR09b-141]; Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural SciencesDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [11-106163]; Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), part of the LOEWE programme 'Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz' of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts","We thank Michael Kearney, Bob Holt and Steven Higgins for very helpful and thoughtful comments.

Reasons hindering our ability to forecast species range shifts and expansions are the mismatch between realized climate niches in species' native and invasive ranges, and the lack of available climatic datasets offering multiple scales of climatic variability (e.g., monthly and inter-annual climatic variability). Here we present a multi-taxon analysis of invasive species niche transferability that considers multi-scale climatic variability using ten noxious terrestrial invasive species. We compare native versus invasive ranges in geographic space as estimated using the species distribution modeling (SDM) algorithm Maxent, and the comparative index Hellinger's I with three possible climatic layer configurations representing natural climatic variability: (1) inter-annual, (2) monthly and (3) a combination of inter-annual and monthly climatic variability. We assess model performance using the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC). Results show that combined scales of climatic variability improved performance of the models for 60% of the species in the native range and 70% of the species in the invaded range. Contrasting native and invaded range SDM performance showed that the same climate layer configuration produced the best models only in 70% of the species. For 90% of the species the most similar niches were obtained based on monthly climatic variability. The divergence in our findings between higher performing SDMs and the most transferable SDMs, suggest some species range limits might be constrained by one scale of climatic variability in the native range and a different one in the invaded range. Where sufficient occurrence data in the invaded range is available, the inclusion of an additional scale of climatic variability can enhance ecological understanding of the invasion events. However, when invaded range occurrence data is not available, the most conservative approach would use only monthly climatic variability. If these finding are extrapolated to niche transferability in time, we suggest that historical collection records should be analyzed to understand species' response to multiple scales of climate variability in the past, thereby informing the selection of appropriate scales of climate variability in the future.

A key issue in climate envelope modeling is the selection of predictor variables that most directly influence species. To determine whether model performance and spatial predictions were related to the selection of predictor variables, we compared models using bioclimate variables with models constructed from monthly climate data for twelve terrestrial vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using two different algorithms (random forests or generalized linear models), and two model selection techniques (using uncorrelated predictors or a subset of user-defined biologically relevant predictor variables). There were no differences in performance between models created with bioclimate or monthly variables, but one metric of model performance was significantly greater using the random forest algorithm compared with generalized linear models. Spatial predictions between maps using bioclimate and monthly variables were very consistent using the random forest algorithm with uncorrelated predictors, whereas we observed greater variability in predictions using generalized linear models.

The main limitation of SDMs lies in their assumption that species' ranges are determined mostly by climate, which is arguable. For instance, biotic interactions, habitat and elevation may affect species ranges. The inclusion of habitat-related variables as predictors in SDMs is generally accepted, but there is no consensus regarding the inclusion of elevation. A review of randomly chosen literature revealed that elevation is used as a predictor variable by just over half of the papers studied with no apparent trends as to why, except that papers predicting mammal species distributions for large regions included elevation more often than not, and that papers that predicted mammal ranges for small regions tended to exclude elevation. In addition, we compared the performance of SDMs with and without elevation as a predictor variable for the distribution of north European mammals and plants and found that the difference between their performances is statistically significant for mammals, slightly favouring exclusion of elevation. No differences were found for plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we show the need for, and the application of, a process-based relationship between soil moisture conditions and vegetation characteristics. We considered 366 groundwater-dependent sites, where oxygen stress, caused by a surplus of soil moisture, codetermines plant performance. We compared two existing indirect proxies for the soil oxygen status namely mean spring groundwater level (MSL) and sum exceedence value (SEV) with our newly developed process-based proxy, viz. root respiration stress (RS). The two indirect proxies and the process-based proxy for oxygen stress performed equally well in describing vegetation characteristics for the Netherlands under the current climate. However, relationships based on MSL and SEV appeared to produce systematic prediction errors when applied outside their calibration range, in contrast to the relationship based on RS. Hence, the two indirect proxies cannot be used in projections, such as in predicting effects of climate change on vegetation composition, all the more because they unlike RS do not account for essential parameters that determine oxygen stress (e.g. temperature and extreme rainfall events in the growing season). We advocate using RS for estimating vegetation impacts in climate projections to increase the reliability and effectiveness of adaptive strategies.

Collectively, these models have considerably increased our fundamental knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of ecosystem functions, processes, and structure. We explore three areas where models for rangeland management are often challenging for land managers and enterprise-level decision making: 1) coping with spatiotemporal and climatic variability in implementing scenario forecasting, risk assessments, and adaptive management; 2) addressing outputs of multiple ecosystem goods and services and determining whether they are synergistic or competitive; and 3) integrating experimental and experiential knowledge and observations into decision making. Increasing the utility of models for rangeland management remains a key frontier and a major research need for the modeling community and will be achieved less by further technical advances and model complexity and more by the use of existing topoedaphic databases, the capacity to readily incorporate new experimental and experiential knowledge, and the use of frameworks that facilitate outcome-based, adaptive decision making at the enterprise level with associated economic considerations. Opportunities exist for increasing the utility of models for decision making and adaptive rangeland management through better matching of model complexity with enterprise-level, decision-making goals. This could be accomplished by incorporating a fundamental understanding of herbivory, fire, and spatiotemporal interactions with weather patterns that affect multiple ecosystem functions. Most important, effective models would allow land managers in a changing and variable climate to 1) evaluate trade offs in producing multiple goods and services, 2) optimize the application of conservation practices spatially (comparing costs and benefits accrued across different timescales), and 3) incorporate manager capacity, including experience, skills, and labor input.",,,,,"Augustine, David/0000-0003-3144-0466; Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736",,,,,18,19,3,54,,,,1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

We then compared the predictive ability of thermal tolerance vs. correlative species distribution models (SDMs) which are popular forecasting tools for modeling the effects of climate change. Thermal tolerances predicted the responses of 19 ant species to experimental climate warming at the southern site, where environmental conditions are relatively close to the ants' upper thermal limits. In contrast, thermal tolerances did not predict the responses of the six species in the northern site, where environmental conditions are relatively far from the ants' upper thermal limits. Correlative SDMs were not predictive at either site.

This may prevent the identification and conservation of the most suitable sectors, or the detection of local and regional features affecting the species during winter. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of ring recoveries to predict bird distribution in wintering grounds by using Maxent, one of the presence-only techniques available for modelling species distributions. We test whether suitability indices obtained in 2.5 x 2.5 km UTM squares from ring recoveries were positively correlated with the actual abundance of robins (Erithacus rubecula) and blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) inside the squares. Location Spain. Methods We used 686 and 1139 localities across the country in which blackcap and robin ring recoveries were recorded by the Spanish Office of Migratory Species to generate the suitability maps. In addition, we sampled bird abundance inside 70 control squares independent of ring recovery localities along a belt crossing mountains, highlands and lowlands of the Iberian Peninsula during January from 2006 to 2011. Results Suitability indices predicted by Maxent were positively correlated with robin (r = 0.42, n = 70, P < 0.001) and blackcap (r = 0.52, n = 70, P < 0.001) abundances in the 70 control squares along the belt crossing the Iberian Peninsula. Main conclusions These results suggest that the use of distribution models with ring recoveries may be used to describe the habitat suitability of the winter ranges of small, common passerines. This also means that the huge number of ring recoveries stored in national and transnational data banks could be used to explore the factors shaping bird ranges and to forecast the geographical distribution of suitable wintering areas of migratory birds in large, poorly known regions.

Simulating the spatio-temporal dynamics of biofuel croplands can provide critical information required for assessing the impacts of land-use change on wildlife conservation and water quality. But, yearly agricultural practices such as crop rotations often complicate the spatially explicit modeling of specific crops' expansion. Our research focused on developing a geospatial modeling framework that is able to distinguish long-term, regional changes in croplands from short-term, local fluctuations (such as rotations), using geographic information systems (GIS) and the land transformation model (LTM). The USDA Cropland Data Layers (CDLs) of North Dakota for 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011 were spatially and temporally aggregated to generate a series of biofuel cropland maps. The historical cropland data for 1999/2000 and 2004/2005, together with a collection of environmental factors (i.e., topography, soil fertility, and climate), were used to calibrate the neural network embedded in the LTM. Validation analysis was then conducted by simulating the biofuel cropland change during the period of 2004/2005-2010/2011 using the calibrated LTM and comparing the simulation result with the observed change for the same time period, resulting in 6.3% allocation disagreement (0% quantity disagreement) and 27.4% figure of merit.

As surface elevation change did not differ significantly from accretion over the 10 year study period in the mangrove and saltmarsh (p = 0.4104), the accretion model was regarded as a reliable estimate of elevation change. Using the current rate of sea-level rise (3.65 mm y(-1)), a rate deemed to be relatively moderate, a landscape elevation model was developed by applying the accretion model to a LiDAR-derived digital elevation model at annual increments to 2050. Based on current rates of sea-level rise and the intertidal elevation that currently supports mangrove and saltmarsh, the landscape elevation model projected a 16% increase in the area within the elevation range suitable to support mangrove and saltmarsh. This contrasts 'bathtub modelling', which projected a 6% decline in wetland extent. Bathtub modelling fails to account for the ability of mangrove and saltmarsh to accommodate sea-level rise through processes of accretion, shrink-swell of sediments and the accumulation of organic material. Results from the landscape elevation model suggest that planning for sea-level rise should be directed towards facilitating wetland adaptation by promoting tidal exchange to mangrove and saltmarsh and providing land for wetland migration.

As temperatures rise, cold-water fish distributions may shift and contract in response. Predicting the effects of projected stream warming in stream networks is complicated by the generally poor correlation between water temperature and air temperature. Spatial dependencies in stream networks are complex because the geography of stream processes is governed by dimensions of flow direction and network structure. Therefore, forecasting climate-driven range shifts of stream biota has lagged behind similar terrestrial modeling efforts. We predicted climate-induced changes in summer thermal habitat for 3 cold-water fish speciesjuvenile Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and bull trout (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. mykiss, and Salvelinus confluentus, respectively)in the John Day River basin, northwestern United States. We used a spatially explicit statistical model designed to predict water temperature in stream networks on the basis of flow and spatial connectivity. The spatial distribution of stream temperature extremes during summers from 1993 through 2009 was largely governed by solar radiation and interannual extremes of air temperature.

The biome's biodiversity is highly threatened due to exposure to land conversion for agricultural and cattle ranch. Climate forecasts predict increases in aridity, which could pose additional threats to the biome's biodiversity. Here, we ask if the remnants of natural vegetation in Caatinga biome, where endemic terrestrial vertebrate species occur, are likely to retain more climatic suitability under climate change scenarios than other less pristine areas of the biome. In order to assess changes in climate suitability across individual species ranges, ensemble forecasting was used based on seven bioclimatic envelope models, three atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, and two greenhouse emission gas scenarios for 2020, 2050, and 2080. We found that most species will gain climatic suitability in the natural vegetation remnants of the Caatinga. Such gains are even greater than the expected to occur within random sets of areas with size similar to the natural vegetation remnants. Our results suggest that natural vegetation remnants will likely play a role of climate refuges for endemic vertebrate species, so efforts should be concentrated in these regions.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre Felizola/D-9405-2013; Alagador, Diogo/A-2846-2014; de Oliveira, Guilherme/S-1531-2019; Rangel, Thiago F/H-8708-2012","Araujo, Miguel/0000-0002-5107-7265; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre Felizola/0000-0002-0967-9684; Alagador, Diogo/0000-0003-0710-3187; Rangel, Thiago F/0000-0002-2001-7382",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [552961/2008-6]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); CAPES-Balcao [5201-09-8]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BPD/51512/2011]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,"The authors are grateful to two anonymous reviewers, and to the cooperation project of Fundacao para Ciencia e a Tecnologia and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (FCT-CAPES, Portugal-Brasil).

The method requires species distribution data from multiple time points, and accounts for temporal uncertainty in colonisation times inherent in such data. Covariates, such as climate parameters, altitude and land use, which capture variation in the suitability of sites for plant colonisation, are easily incorporated into the model. The method assumes no local extinction of occupied sites and thus is primarily applicable to modelling distribution data at relatively coarse spatial resolutions of plant species whose range is expanding over time. The implementation of the model and inference algorithm are illustrated through application to British floristic atlas data for the widespread alien Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) assessed at a 10 X 10 km resolution in 1970 and 2000. We infer key characteristics of this species, predict its future spread, and use the resulting fitted model to inform a simulation-based assessment of the methodology. Simulated distribution data are used to validate the inference algorithm. Our results suggest that the accuracy of inference is not sensitive to the number of distribution time points, requiring only that there are at least two points in time when distributions are mapped. We demonstrate the utility of the modelling approach by making future forecasts and historic hindcasts of the distribution of giant hogweed in Great Britain. Giant hogweed is one of the worst alien plants in Britain and has rapidly increased its range since 1970, yet we highlight that a further 20% of land area remains susceptible to colonisation by this species. We use the robustness of this case study to discuss the potential for modelling distribution data for other species and at different spatial scales.",,,,"Marion, Glenn/J-4738-2013; Cook, Alex/B-5941-2011; Cook, Alex/S-3576-2019; Butler, Adam/A-8002-2010; Catterall, Stephen/I-7217-2013; Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011","Cook, Alex/0000-0002-6271-5832; Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474",European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [GOCE-CT-2003-506675]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [GRT11777]; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS); National Univ. of Singapore; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [GR/T11777/01],"We are grateful to Ingolf Kuhn for useful discussions and his comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Increases in the population density of medically relevant organisms are of particular importance to public health as they are often correlated with the emergence of infectious diseases in human populations. Our aim is to delineate increases in density of a common disease vector in North America, the blacklegged tick, and to identify the environmental factors correlated with these population dynamics. Empirical data that capture the growth of a population are often necessary to identify environmental factors associated with these dynamics. We analyzed temporally-and spatially-structured field collected data in a geographical information systems framework to describe the population growth of blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and to identify environmental and climatic factors correlated with these dynamics. The density of the ticks increased throughout the study's temporal and spatial ranges. Tick density increases were positively correlated with mild temperatures, low precipitation, low forest cover, and high urbanization. Importantly, models that accounted for these environmental factors accurately forecast future tick densities across the region. Tick density increased annually along the south-to-north gradient. These trends parallel the increases in human incidences of diseases commonly vectored by I. scapularis. For example, I. scapularis densities are correlated with human Lyme disease incidence, albeit in a non-linear manner that disappears at low tick densities, potentially indicating that a threshold tick density is needed to support epidemiologically-relevant levels of the Lyme disease bacterium. Our results demonstrate a connection between the biogeography of this species and public health.",,,,"Brisson, Dustin/B-2428-2008","Brisson, Dustin/0000-0002-9493-7579","Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention [CK000170]; National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI076342, AI097137]","C.

In this regard, rather than picking the single ""best-fit"" model to predict future system responses, we can use Bayesian model averaging to synthesize the forecasts from different models. Does the combination of several models of different complexity improve our capacity to synthesize different perceptions of the ecosystem functioning and therefore the value of the modelling enterprise in the context of ecosystem management? Our study addresses this question using a complex (14 state-variable) eutrophication model along with a simpler modelling construct that considers the interplay among phosphate, detritus. and generic phytoplankton and zooplankton state variables. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the relative mean standard error to assess the posterior support of the two models after considering the available data from the system. Predictions from the two models are then combined using the respective standard error estimates as weights in a weighted model average. The model averaging approach is used to examine the robustness of predictive statements made from our earlier work regarding the response of Hamilton Harbour (Ontario, Canada) to the different nutrient loading reduction strategies. In particular, we consolidate the finding that the existing total phosphorus goal (<17 mu g L-1) is most likely unattainable, and therefore we identify the most achievable ambient target under the most stringent (but realistic) nutrient loading reduction scenario. Finally, the discrepancy between the chlorophyll a predictions of the two models pinpoint the need to delve into the dynamics of phosphorus in the sediment-water column interface, as the internal nutrient loading can conceivably be a regulatory factor of the duration of the transient phase and the recovery resilience of the system.

If so, do changes in the frequency of upland and meadow habitats exploited by two species of lemmings confirm that their strategies of habitat selection have also changed? Field methods: We measured habitat at 300 permanent stations on 12 study plots in 1996 and in 2010. We classified habitat into upland versus meadow categories and estimated population abundances of the two lemming species in both habitats in eight different years. Statistical and conceptual methods: Logistic regression, path analysis, isodars, invader strategy landscapes. Assumptions: Lemmings are ideal density-dependent habitat selectors. Habitat selection strategies vary with density and depend on the frequency of alternative strategies. Results: Meadow habitat became more frequent while the proportion of upland habitat declined. Habitat selection strategies shifted with changes in habitat even though lemming abundance was lower in warm years than in cool years. Shallow selection gradients, which yield a small fitness advantage for the optimum strategy at low density, become increasingly steep at high densities. Conclusion: Analysis of altered patterns of habitat selection can forecast future strategies of habitat use with changing climate. But reductions in lemming abundance with global warming portend an increasing role for stochasticity in their future habitat selection.",,,,,,"Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; International Polar Year (IPY) Program; Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP, Natural Resources Canada); Northern Scientific Training Program","Financial and logistical support was provided by Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, International Polar Year (IPY) Program, Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP, Natural Resources Canada) and Northern Scientific Training Program.

World-wide extinctions of amphibians are at the forefront of the biodiversity crisis, with climate change figuring prominently as a potential driver of continued amphibian decline. As in other taxa, changes in both the mean and variability of climate conditions may affect amphibian populations in complex, unpredictable ways. In western North America, climate models predict a reduced duration and extent of mountain snowpack and increased variability in precipitation, which may have consequences for amphibians inhabiting montane ecosystems. 2. We used Bayesian capturerecapture methods to estimate survival and transition probabilities in a high-elevation population of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) over 10 years and related these rates to interannual variation in peak snowpack. Then, we forecasted frog population growth and viability under a range of scenarios with varying levels of change in mean and variance in snowpack. 3. Over a range of future scenarios, changes in mean snowpack had a greater effect on viability than changes in the variance of snowpack, with forecasts largely predicting an increase in population viability. Population models based on snowpack during our study period predicted a declining population. 4. Although mean conditions were more important for viability than variance, for a given mean snowpack depth, increases in variability could change a population from increasing to decreasing. Therefore, the influence of changing climate variability on populations should be accounted for in predictive models. The Bayesian modelling framework allows for the explicit characterization of uncertainty in parameter estimates and ecological forecasts, and thus provides a natural approach for examining relative contributions of mean and variability in climatic variables to population dynamics. 5. Longevity and heterogeneous habitat may contribute to the potential for this amphibian species to be resilient to increased climatic variation, and shorter-lived species inhabiting homogeneous ecosystems may be more susceptible to increased variability in climate conditions.",,,,"Solonen, Antti/C-9460-2014","McCaffery, Rebecca/0000-0002-0396-0387",Fulbright Program; US Geological Survey's Amphibian Research and Monitoring InitiativeUnited States Geological Survey; US Forest Service Region 1 Inventory and Monitoring grants,"We thank B.

Due to the naturally low concentration of CO (3) (2-) in the Arctic, this foraminifer could be particularly sensitive to the forecast changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. To assess potential responses to ocean acidification and climate change, perturbation experiments were performed on juvenile and adult specimens by manipulating seawater to mimic the present-day carbon dioxide level and a future ocean acidification scenario (end of the century) under controlled (in situ) and elevated temperatures (1 and 4 A degrees C, respectively). Foraminifera mortality was unaffected under all the different experiment treatments. Under low pH, N. pachyderma (s) shell net calcification rates decreased. This decrease was higher (30 %) in the juvenile specimens than decrease observed in the adults (21 %) ones. However, decrease in net calcification was moderated when both, pH decreased and temperature increased simultaneously. When only temperature increased, a net calcification rate for both life stages was not affected. These results show that forecast changes in seawater chemistry would impact calcite production in N. pachyderma (s), possibly leading to a reduction of calcite flux contribution and consequently a decrease in biologic pump efficiency.",,,,,,MERCLIM [184860]; NORKLIMA through the Norwegian Research Council; EC through the Marine Ecosystem Evolution in a Changing Environment (MEECE) [212085],"This study has been partially funded by the Marine Ecosystem Response to a Changing Climate project (MERCLIM No 184860) financed by the program NORKLIMA through the Norwegian Research Council and through Theme 6 of the EC seventh framework program through the Marine Ecosystem Evolution in a Changing Environment (MEECE No 212085) Collaborative Project.

We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SICa) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SICa, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SICa. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adelie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SICa, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adelie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which demographic models are linked to IPCC climate models, is powerful and generally applicable to other species and systems.",,,,"Weimerskirch, Henri/K-7306-2019; Barbraud, Christophe/A-5870-2012; Weimerskirch, Henri/F-5562-2013","Weimerskirch, Henri/0000-0002-0457-586X; jenouvrier, stephanie/0000-0003-3324-2383; Caswell, Hal/0000-0003-4394-6894",Expeditions Polaires Francaises; Institut Paul Emile Victor (Programme IPEV 109); Terres Australes et Antarctiques Francaises; REMIGE (Behavioural and demographic REsponses of Indian Ocean Marine top predators to Global Environmental changes) program; ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) Biodiversite (ANR Biodiv 011)French National Research Agency (ANR); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816514]; WHOI Arctic Research Initiative; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,"The penguin data come from a long-term study supported by Expeditions Polaires Francaises, by Institut Paul Emile Victor (Programme IPEV 109), and by Terres Australes et Antarctiques Francaises.

We used MaxEnt to analyze relationships between occurrence records and climatic variables to develop a bioclimatic-envelope model, which we refined by masking with a deductive appropriate-habitat filter based on suitable land-cover types. We used this final species-distribution model to predict distribution of suitable habitat under range-wide temperature increases from 1 to 7 degrees C, in 1 degrees C increments; we also compared these results to distribution under IPCC-forecasted climates for 2050 and 2080. Though all currently recognized lineages and traditionally defined subspecies were predicted to lose increasing amounts of habitat as temperatures rose, the most-dramatic range losses were predicted to occur among traditional subspecies. Nineteen of the 31 traditional US pika subspecies were predicted to lose > 98% of their suitable habitat under a 7 degrees C increase in the mean temperature of the warmest quarter of the year, and lineages were predicted to lose 88 95% of suitable habitat. Under a 4 degrees C increase, traditional subspecies averaged a predicted 73% (range = 4499%) reduction. The appropriate-habitat filter removed 406% of the predicted climatically suitable pixels, in a stepped and monotonically decreasing fashion as predicted temperatures rose. Predicted range collapse proceeded until only populations in island-biogeographic mainlands remained, which were not in the geographic range center. We used this model system to illustrate possible distributional shifts under stepped changes in biologically relevant aspects of climate, importance of land cover and taxonomic level in species-distribution forecasts, and impact of using a single threshold vs multiple categories of persistence probability in predicted range maps; we encourage additional research to further investigate the generality of these patterns.",,,,"Boykin, Ken/D-2863-2009; Frey, Jennifer K./F-8945-2011; Beever, Erik/Q-3869-2019","Boykin, Ken/0000-0001-6381-0463; Frey, Jennifer K./0000-0002-0122-2567; Beever, Erik/0000-0002-9369-486X",National Gap Analysis Program of the U.S. Geological Survey,"Profound thanks go to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (data publishers included Arctos, Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics, California Academy of Sciences, Cornell Univ.

The expected increase in temperature during the 21st century will be most stressful for cold-adapted and stenothermic mountain species, forcing them to migrate upwards, and eventually to concentrate into either large areas with favourable climates (refugia) or small stands under locally favourable microclimates (microrefugia). We investigate potential refugia in the neotropical Guayana Highlands mountain biome (Pantepui), consisting of similar to 50 isolated table mountains (tepuis), to develop strategies for conserving biodiversity during future global warming. We predict the amount of loss of attitudinal habitats of endemic vascular flora of 26 tepuis and evaluate potential threats to these taxa with respect to species extinction, habitat loss, habitat connectivity and the degree of isolation. We compare past, present and future Pantepui landscape configurations through fragmentation analysis and identify potential in situ refugia. Spatial analysis forecasts more species isolation and declining biodiversity at the end of this century relative to current and past levels. Habitats are predicted to experience >80% loss, with the disappearance of 38 habitat patches. One large patch (ChimantS massif) accounts for 46% of the predicted remaining habitat. This patch can be considered a potential refugium for future vascular flora, as it is predicted to contain some present-day resistant species from lower attitudinal levels and other species eventually persisting in microrefugia. The easternmost Pantepui district, containing the Chimanta massif and other tepuis, seems to be the most suitable for the application of in situ conservation strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There is considerable theoretical support for early warning signals, but there is a critical lack of field observations to test the efficacy of early warning signals at spatial and temporal scales relevant for ecosystem management. Conditional heteroskedasticity is persistent periods of high and low variance that may be a powerful leading indicator of regime shift. We evaluated conditional heteroskedasticity as an early warning indicator by applying moving window conditional heteroskedasticity tests to time series of chlorophyll-a and fish catches derived from a whole-lake experiment designed to create a regime shift. There was significant conditional heteroskedasticity at least a year prior to the regime shift in the manipulated lake but there was no significant conditional heteroskedasticity in an adjacent reference lake.

Linked demographic-bioclimatic models are emerging tools for forecasting climate change impacts on well-studied species, but these methods have been used in few management applications, and species interactions have not been incorporated. We combined population and bioclimatic envelope models to estimate future risks to the viability of a cockatoo population posed by climate change, increased fire frequency, beak-and-feather disease and reduced management. 2. The South Australian glossy black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus is restricted to Kangaroo Island, Australia, where it numbers 350 birds and is managed intensively. The cockatoo may be at particular risk from climate change because of its insular geographic constraints and specialised diet on a single plant species, Allocasuarina verticillata. The cockatoo population model was parameterised with mark-resight-derived estimates of survival and fecundity from 13 years of demographic data. Species interactions were incorporated by using a climate-change-driven bioclimatic model of Allocasuarina verticillata as a dynamic driver of habitat suitability. A novel application of Latin Hypercube sampling was used to assess the models sensitivity to input parameters. 3. Results suggest that unmitigated climate change is likely to be a substantial threat for the cockatoo: all high-CO2-concentration scenarios had expected minimum abundances of <160 birds. Extinction was virtually certain if management of nest-predating brush-tail possums Trichosurus vulpecula was stopped, or adult survival reduced by as little as 5%. In contrast, the population is predicted to increase under low-emissions scenarios. 4. Disease outbreak, increased fire frequency and reductions in revegetation and management of competitive little corellas Cacatua sanguinea, were all predicted to exacerbate decline, but these effects were buffered by the cockatoo populations high fecundity. 5. Spatial correlates of extinction risk, such as range area and total habitat suitability, were nonlinearly related to projected population size in the high-CO2-concentration scenario. 6. Synthesis and applications. Mechanistic demographic-bioclimatic simulations that incorporate species interactions can provide more detailed viability analyses than traditional bioclimatic models and be used to rank the cost-effectiveness of management interventions. Our results highlight the importance of managing possum predation and maintaining high adult cockatoo survival. In contrast, corella and revegetation management could be experimentally reduced to save resources.",,,,"Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Akcakaya, H.

Despite the presence of a resident population of Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus has expanded its presence in urban areas, in contrast to the pattern of invasion by this mosquito elsewhere in the world. We undertook a comparative study of the distribution and abundance of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti populations between 2007 and 2010 in different types of urban landscapes to document the invasion process. Urban and suburban areas at five localities on Mayotte were selected and ten houses with mosquito-infested larval habitats on the property were located in each area. To calculate variables that might explain mosquito infestation, the areas around the houses selected were overlaid on maps with grid cells (each 25 x 25 m) and the areas inside grid cells were analyzed to define landscape characteristics (percentage of built on land and human density) that might be predictive of Ae. albopictus presence and abundance. The proportion of sites occupied by only Ae. albopictus and the relative abundance of this species relative to total Aedes larvae and pupae significantly increased between 2007 and 2010, in both urban and in rural areas. In the 2010 survey, the number of larval habitats occupied by Ae. aegypti in the sampled area decreased sharply compared to 2007. The proportion of land with paved or hard surfaces (roads, buildings, hereafter ""built-up area""), the increase of urbanized areas between 2003 and 2008, and the density of human residents were all correlated with higher relative abundance of Ae. albopictus. The urban areas of Mayotte have significant amounts of vegetation even in the more densely populated areas, and this factor may have facilitated the invasion of Ae. albopictus by providing abundant adult resting sites. These findings are relevant for vector control strategies and forecasting the success of invasions of Ae. albopictus in urban areas in other countries.",,,,"FONTENILLE, didier/G-4091-2013",,,,,,20,20,1,46,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Here, we investigate the reliability of these models in predicting future climatic suitability for 4 invasive decapods of the Iberian Peninsula: Cherax destructor, Eriocheir sinensis, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. From an ensemble of forecasts generated by 5 distinct algorithms (generalized linear models, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and alternating decision trees), we calculated consensus predictions for current conditions and 3 future time periods (2030, 2050 and 2080) under low and high scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. Three criteria were examined to infer the robustness of the forecasts: ability to predict current distributions, inter-model variability and degree of environmental extrapolation. Our results indicate an overall decline in climatic suitability for the 4 invaders as time progresses. However, we also identified highly distinct levels of predictive uncertainty among species. Good indicators of reliability were found for Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, whereas the predictions for C. destructor showed low predictive performance, low inter-model agreement and wide areas of environmental extrapolation. For E. sinensis, the models also showed high variability with respect to areas projected to lose climatic suitability.

Its reliability is often questioned, but is rarely subject to empirical testing and validation. We investigate the ability of experts to make quantitative predictions of variables for which the answers are known. Location Global. Methods Experts in four ecological subfields were asked to make predictions about the outcomes of scientific studies, in the form of unpublished (in press) journal articles, based on information in the article introduction and methods sections. Estimates from students were elicited for one case study for comparison. For each variable, participants assessed a lower and upper bound, best guess and level of confidence that the observed value will lie within their ascribed interval. Responses were assessed for (1) accuracy: the degree to which predictions corresponded with observed experimental results, (2) informativeness: precision of the uncertainty bounds, and (3) calibration: degree to which the uncertainty bounds contained the truth as often as specified. Results Expert responses were found to be overconfident, specifying 80% confidence intervals that captured the truth only 4965% of the time. In contrast, student 80% intervals captured the truth 76% of the time, displaying close to perfect calibration. Best estimates from experts were on average more accurate than those from students. The best students outperformed the worst experts. No consistent relationships were observed between performance and years of experience, publication record or self-assessment of expertise.

Early-successional species were more closely related than expected by chance, whereas late-successional species tended to be less closely related than expected by chance. Then, we evaluated temporal changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedling and tree assemblages in four 1-ha plots of secondary forests in this region. We found an increase in the phylogenetic evenness among tree individuals over time in all secondary tree assemblages, indicating that relatedness among tree individuals decreases as succession unfolds. This pattern was jointly promoted by recruitment and mortality processes, suggesting that increasing evenness was caused by the replacement of individuals of early-successional species from closely related lineages by late-successional species belonging to a wider diversity of lineages. Based on species occurrence, however, tree community reassembly did not show any significant phylogenetic trend over time. These results suggest that shifts in species abundance over succession have a greater impact on the phylogenetic structure of the community than the turnover of species. Seedling assemblages showed higher phylogenetic evenness than tree assemblages, suggesting that propagule colonization is an important process driving phylogenetic changes in species composition throughout succession. Overall, our findings showed that the phylogenetic structure of these successional communities varies at two temporal scales. At short timescales, decreased dominance by early-successional species over succession leads to increased evenness among tree individuals. At longer timescales, colonization processes result in increased phylogenetic evenness in seedling communities compared to tree communities, forecasting increasing phylogenetic evenness among adult individuals at late-successional stages.",,,,"Swenson, Nathan/A-3514-2012; Chazdon, Robin/O-9766-2018","Swenson, Nathan/0000-0003-3819-9767; Letcher, Susan/0000-0002-9475-7674; Chazdon, Robin/0000-0002-7349-5687; Boukili, Vanessa/0000-0002-5950-2123","Andrew W.

If they affect many traits (are pleiotropic), large effect mutations should contribute more when a population evolves to a farther adaptive peak than to a nearer peak. We tested this prediction in wild threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by comparing the estimated frequency of large effect genetic changes underlying evolution as the same ancestor adapted to two lake types since the end of the ice age. A higher frequency of large effect genetic changes (quantitative trait loci) contributed to adaptive evolution in populations that adapted to lakes representing a more distant optimum than to lakes in which the optimum phenotype was nearer to the ancestral state. Our results also indicate that pleiotropy, not just optimum overshoot, contributes to this difference. These results suggest that a series of adaptive improvements to a new environment leaves a detectable mark in the genome of wild populations.

We analyze the impacts of climatic variables and treatment site characteristics, such as sagebrush abundance levels, precipitation, and understory composition, on forage response and threshold level. We find that sagebrush canopy cover levels, April precipitation, May soil moisture, and understory composition are statistically significant factors in explaining forage response to sagebrush treatment. Forage yield across treated and untreated plots for 10 canopy cover levels, ranging from 4% to 40%, are analyzed via panel data regression techniques. We further investigate the impact of variability in precipitation and understory characteristics on economic outcomes of sagebrush control by analyzing three scenarios. Scenario 1 uses actual forage response data that include all variability from precipitation and understory composition. Scenario 2 uses regression-predicted yields across plots assuming average precipitation and soil moisture conditions. Scenario 3 uses regression-predicted yields assuming average precipitation, soil moisture, and understory characteristics across plots. Net present values based on value of grazing (for estimated yield differences between treated and untreated plots assuming 50% forage utilization) compared to treatment cost across sagebrush cover levels are estimated across these three scenarios. Results indicate that the economic threshold level of sagebrush infestation for the study period was between 8% and 24% for the analyzed scenarios. This indicates variability in precipitation and understory composition impact forage response and the resulting economics of sagebrush control.

In order to forecast ecosystem responses to environmental alterations in watersheds, understanding how processes at different spatial scales affect the ecology of organisms is critical. We used the semi-aquatic American dipper Cinclus mexicanus to evaluate how large-scale, regional variables (e.g. climate); landscape-scale, watershed variables (e.g. land use/cover); and local, reach-level variables (e.g. stream geomorphology) influenced various descriptors of American dipper ecology, including productivity, stable nitrogen isotopes (d15N), and individual condition. From 2005 to 2008, we collected data at 26 American dipper territories distributed throughout a 25 000 km2 region within Idaho, USA. We then used structural equation modeling to consider potential direct and indirect relationships among scalar factors on measures of American dipper ecology. We found that complex interactions among factors at all three spatial scales influenced dipper productivity, but that d15N and individual condition were explained by characteristics at the regional and landscape scales only. In particular, model results demonstrate that precipitation was associated with notable variation in multiple dipper responses. Local factors, influencing only dipper productivity, were dominated by hydrogeomorphic characteristics. Our study underscores the simultaneous independent and synergistic roles of environmental factors across spatial scales on American dippers, and offers evidence that pathways influencing aquatic biota may not always conform to hierarchical spatial relationships in watersheds.",,,,"Vierling, Kerri/N-6653-2016; Sullivan, S.

In temperate Japan, the occurrence of this leafhopper fluctuates widely among years. Here, we examined effects of climatic factors (temperature, precipitation and sunlight) on the occurrence of C. bipunctata. Seasonal occurrence of adult C. bipunctata in a census field from July to August, when forage maize was most susceptible to the pest, could be described by a simple exponential function with two parameter: estimated density of C. bipunctata on 1 July (N (0)) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) for each year. Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis using seasonal occurrence data from 2004 to 2009 detected positive contributions of average temperatures in the previous December and February and a negative contribution of total precipitation during the previous winter to N (0). The analysis also indicated that average temperature in July of the current year and N (0) contributed positively and negatively to r, respectively. These results indicated that high temperature and little precipitation during winter and high temperature in early summer induced high occurrence of C. bipunctata in summer. A prediction model based on these factors supported the actual seasonal occurrence in 2010, suggesting that this prediction model is applicable to C. bipunctata forecasting. The prediction model indicated that further global warming in the future is likely to cause further outbreaks of C. bipunctata.",,,,,,"Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of JapanMinistry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan [44130]","This study was supported by Development of mitigation and adaptation techniques to global warming in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (44130) from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan.",,,6,6,0,6,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

We have experimentally assessed the effect of drier and wetter summer conditions on the recruitment probabilities and the growth of seedlings from eight woody species representative of the most important functional groups in the community, pioneer shrubs, mid-successional shrubs and trees, across the main habitats in the study area (open habitat, shrubland, and forest). Our hypothesis proposes that wet summer conditions would represent a good opportunity for tree species regeneration, enhancing both forest maintenance and expansion. A drier summer scenario, on the other hand, would limit forest regeneration, and probably hinder the colonization of nearby habitats. We found a habitat effect on the emergence, survival, and final biomass, whereas different climate scenarios affected seedling survival and biomass. A wet summer boosted growth and survival, whereas greater drought reduced survival only in some cases. These results were modulated by the habitat type. Overall, shrub species presented higher survival and growth and were less affected by more severe drought, whereas some tree species proved to be extremely dependent on wet summer conditions. We conclude that the reduction in frequency of wet summers predicted for the coming decades in Mediterranean areas will have greater consequences for species recruitment than will increased drought.

Based on multi-year relationships between precipitation amount and aboveground annual net primary production (ANPP), semi-arid grasslands are projected to be among the most sensitive ecosystems to changes in precipitation. To assess sensitivity to drought, as well as variability within the shortgrass steppe biome, we imposed moderate and severe rainfall reductions for two growing seasons in three undisturbed grasslands that varied in soil type and climate. We predicted strong drought-induced reductions in ANPP at all sites and greater sensitivity to drought in sites with lower average precipitation, consistent with continental-scale patterns. Identical experimental infrastructure at each site reduced growing season rainfall events by 50 or 80%, and significantly reduced average soil moisture in both years (by 21 and 46% of control levels, respectively). Despite reductions in soil moisture, ANPP responses varied unexpectedly-from no reduction in ANPP to a 51% decrease. Although sensitivity to drought was highest in the semi-arid grassland with lowest mean annual precipitation, patterns in responses to drought across these grasslands were also strongly related to rainfall event size. When growing season rainfall patterns were dominated by many smaller events, ANPP was significantly reduced by drought but not when rainfall patterns were characterized by large rain events. This interaction between drought sensitivity and rainfall event size suggests that ANPP responses to future droughts may be reduced if growing season rainfall regimes also become more extreme.",,,,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008",,Colorado Agricultural Experimental Station (AES); Southern Plains Inventory and Monitoring Network (SOPN) of the National Park Service,"We would like to thank the numerous research assistants who spent countless hours in the Weld and laboratory.

Upslope shifts of lowland species may partially offset declines in upland species but also result in a process of lowland biotic attrition. This latter process is contingent on the absence of species adapted to novel warm climates, and isolation from pools of potential colonizers. In the Australian Wet Tropics, species distribution modelling has forecast critical declines in suitable environmental area for upland endemic birds, raising the question of the future role of both natural and assisted dispersal in species survival, but information is lacking for important neighbouring rainforest regions. Here we use expanded geographic coverage of data to model the realized distributions of 120 bird species found in north-eastern Australian rainforest, including species from potential source locations in the north and recipient locations in the south. We reaffirm previous conclusions as to the high vulnerability of this fauna to global warming, and extend the list of species whose suitable environmental area is projected to decrease. However, we find that expansion of suitable area for some species currently restricted to northern rainforests has the potential to offset biotic attrition in lowland forest of the Australian Wet Tropics. By examining contrasting dispersal scenarios, we show that responses to climate change in this region may critically depend on dispersal limitation, as climate change shifts the suitable environmental envelopes of many species south into currently unsuitable habitats. For lowland and northern species, future change in vegetation connectivity across contemporary habitat barriers is likely to be an important mediator of climate change impacts. In contrast, upland species are projected to become increasingly isolated and restricted. Their survival is likely to be more dependent on the viability of assisted migration, and the emergence and persistence of suitable environments at recipient locations.",,,,"Anderson, Alexander/G-6937-2013; Williams, Stephen E/A-7250-2008; Shoo, Luke P/A-2715-2009; VanDerWal, Jeremy/C-7457-2009; Reside, April/H-4940-2011","Williams, Stephen E/0000-0002-2510-7408; Reside, April/0000-0002-0760-9527; VanDerWal, Jeremy/0000-0001-7439-8953; Pearson, Richard/0000-0001-6047-031X","Earthwatch Foundation; Birds Australia; Skyrail Rainforest Foundation; Rainforest Cooperative Research Centre (CRC)Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Marine and Tropical Science Research Facility (MTSRF)","We wish to thank the many citizen scientists and data collectors in the Birds Australia Atlas and Wildnet data bases projects (http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/wildlife-ecosystems/wildlife/wildlife_online/index.html), and Birds Australia and DERM for granting access to data.

Models of fitness along a habitat gradient illustrate the connection between fine-scale variation in fitness and the selection of habitat as discontinuous patches in the landscape. According to these models, climate change can increase fitness values of static habitats, shift the fitness value of habitat patches along underlying gradients of habitat quality, or alter both fitness and habitat quality. It should be possible to differentiate amongst these scenarios by associating differences in the abundance and distribution of species with metrics of habitat that document the gradient while controlling for changes in density at larger scales of analysis. Comparisons of habitat selection by two species of lemmings, over an interval of 15 years, are consistent with the theory. The pattern of habitat selection at the scale of wet versus dry tundra habitats changed through time. The change in habitat selection was reflected by different, but nevertheless density-dependent, patterns of association with the structure and composition of habitat. Abundant collared lemmings abandoned stations where altered habitat characteristics caused a shift to new locations along the wet-to-dry gradient. The confirmation of scale-dependent theory provides new insights into how one might begin to forecast future habitat selection under different scenarios of climate and habitat change.",,,,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's Dept of Indian and Northern Affairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program; International Polar Year program 'Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems'; Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank Canada's Dept of Indian and Northern Affairs, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Northern Scientific Training Program, International Polar Year program 'Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems', and Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP) for financial and logistic support (this is PCSP/PPCP publication 015-11).

Here, we use locally linear, autoregressive state-space models to statistically identify nonlinear processes that govern the dynamics of time series. We develop both time-varying and threshold models. In time-varying autoregressive models with p time lags, AR(p), and vector autoregressive models for n-dimensional systems of order p = 1, VAR(1), we assume that coefficients vary with time. We can infer an approaching regime shift if the coefficients indicate critical slowing down of the local dynamics of the system. In self-excited threshold models, we assume that the time series is governed by two autoregressive processes; the state variable switches between them when the time series crosses a threshold value. We use the existence of a statistically significant threshold as an indicator of alternative stable states. All models are fit to data using a state-space form that incorporates measurement error, and maximum likelihood estimation allows for statistically testing alternative hypotheses about the processes governing dynamics. Our model-based approach for forecasting regime shifts and identifying alternative stable states overcomes limitations of other common metric-based approaches and is a useful addition to the toolbox of methods for analyzing nonlinear time series.",,,,,"Dakos, Vasilis/0000-0001-8862-718X",Spinoza (NWO) Award; European Research Council Advanced GrantEuropean Research Council (ERC);  [NSF-DEB0816613],"This work was prompted by the workshop ""Practical Methods for Analysis of Early-Warnings for Regime Shifts'' organized by M.

Focusing on boreal forests in Northeast China, we used spatial point pattern analysis to model fire occurrence reported from 1965 to 2009. Our objectives were to quantitate the relative importance of biotic, abiotic, and human influences on patterns of fire occurrence and to map the spatial distribution of fire occurrence density (number of fires occurring over a given area and time period) under current and future climate conditions. Our results showed human-caused fires were strongly related to human activities (e.g. landscape accessibility), including proximity to settlements and roads. In contrast, fuel moisture and vegetation type were the most important controlling factors on the spatial pattern of lightning fires. Both current and future projected spatial distributions of the overall (human-+lightning-caused) fire occurrence density were strongly clustered along linear components of human infrastructure. Our results demonstrated that the predicted change in overall fire occurrence density is positively related to the degree of temperature and precipitation change, although the spatial pattern of change is expected to vary spatially according to proximity to human ignition sources, and in a manner inconsistent with predicted climate change. Compared to the current overall fire occurrence density (median value: 0.36 fires per 1000km2 per year), the overall fire occurrence density is projected to increase by 30% under the CGCM3 B1 scenario and by 230% under HadCM3 A2 scenario in 20812100, respectively.

Understanding how this variability is modulated by topography, vegetation and population densities and how this impact on ungulate demography is an important step in order to forecast consequences of alternative management scenarios or the effects of climate change. Structural equation modeling (SEMs) is a tool particularly suited to this kind of situations, and allowed us to study the direct and indirect effects of climate, topography, structural and functional aspects of vegetation and population density upon reproductive performance of Patagonian sheep flocks, measured at paddock scale. The application of SEMs in conjunction with information criteria and related techniques for model selection, model averaging and multi-model inference revealed that despite considerable model uncertainty, those paddocks towards the East, with a greater spatial variability in July temperatures and greater primary production during fall-winter (estimated by remote sensing) showed greater lambing rates. Paddocks with higher proportion of meadows and with more intense forage consumption, were also associated with a better reproductive performance. Our results not only provide quantitative hypothesis about the controls at the landscape level of herbivore performance but also provide the basis to devise better management alternatives.

However, significant variability in species responses, together with limited data, frustrates efforts to forecast the consequences of ongoing phenological changes. Herein, we use a case study of three North American plant communities to explore the implications of variability across levels of organisation (within and among species, and among communities) for forecasting responses to climate change. We show how despite significant variation among species in sensitivities to climate, comparable patterns emerge at the community level once regional climate drivers are accounted for. However, communities differ with respect to projected patterns of divergence and overlap among their species phenological distributions in response to climate change.

Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperature-dependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e. g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly.

Policy choice is posed as a decision under Knightian uncertainty, where decision-makers lack grounds for assigning a particular probability distribution across contending forecasting models. The decision is then framed as one of balancing two competing objectives that plausibly align with the dominant concern of stakeholders from each side in the policy debate. A decision criterion is proposed to identify options for compromise that balance these objectives in different ways. The criterion spans three standard non-Bayesian decision criteria. Policies generated by the criterion are combined with visual tools to communicate ""what's at stake"" in an environmental policy decision in which stakeholders disagree both about scientific models and about the relative importance of risks to the environment versus risks to economic growth. The approach summarizes information that could be useful to policy-makers tasked with negotiating a compromise. The framework is applied to climate policy using DICE-2007 (Nordhaus 2008). The results highlight a basic asymmetry between the mistake of ""doing too little"" and that of ""doing too much"" that suggests a strong argument for avoiding the current status quo of global inaction.

The study is carried out in the Dutch region called the Achterhoek. Region-specific scenarios were constructed based on interviews with local experts. The scenarios are simulated in an agent based model incorporating rural residents and farmer characteristics, the environment and different policy interventions for realistic projection of landscape evolution. Results of the model simulations were presented to stakeholders representing different rural sectors at a workshop. The results indicate that illustration of the spatial configuration of landscape changes is appreciated by stakeholders. Testing stakeholders' solutions by way of model simulations revealed that the effectiveness of local interventions is strongly related to exogenous processes such as market competition and endogenous processes like local willingness to engage in multifunctional activities.

Models predicting invasive macrophyte spread between lakes provide an important tool for focusing proactive management efforts to lakes deemed susceptible to invasion. However, challenges to forecasting macrophyte spread include wide physiological tolerances of invasive macrophytes and a lack of information on the relative importance of the various human vectors (e.g. boating traffic). In New Zealand, three invasive species that reproduce vegetatively, Ceratophyllum demersum, Lagarosiphon major, Egeria densa, and a single species that reproduces sexually, Utricularia gibba, are currently spreading across the lake landscape at a great cost to the local ecology and economy. 2. In this study, we first examined whether variables that indirectly describe weed spread via human access and use, as well as a lake's position in the landscape, could describe the distribution of these four species using a boosted regression trees (BRT) modelling approach. Then, as these invasive species have not reached their full invasion potential, we examined how giving more influence to infected lakes at the edge of the invasion front, and including all lakes across New Zealand as background samples, simulating 'absences beyond the invasion front', influenced our ability to forecast the potential for new lakes to be invaded. 3. The BRT models identified that variables characterising human access and use, as well as lake position, were associated with the occurrence of the three vegetatively reproducing macrophytes. Weed occurrence was more likely when there was a highway in the vicinity, human population density was high and if the lake was large (c. 55 km(2)). But in the single case of U. gibba, temperature was the variable that best explained occurrence. This is consistent with the suggestion that U. gibba is predominantly dispersed by waterbirds, rather than human activity. 4. But for all four species, the BRT models based on the recorded observations alone predicted observed invasions with low prediction probabilities and did not forecast further spread. By contrast, when observations at the edge of the invasion front were upweighted, and additional background lakes implemented into the model, recorded observations were predicted and additional lakes were forecast to be at risk, suggesting that these models better captured the current and potential distribution of these macrophyte species. 5. The use of variables that characterise weed spread could provide similar insights into other systems where survey information on the nature, strength and direction of invasion vectors is lacking. Furthermore, when weighting the data, many lakes across New Zealand were forecasted to be at risk of invasion. The advantage of weighing the presence data was that insights into the potential for a species to spread were obtained. The probabilistic estimates of risk, as derived from the models, together with other information for prioritising lakes, can be used to focus surveillance and protection efforts.",,,,"Compton, Tanya/G-6230-2012",,"New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [CO1X0510]","The authors thank John Clayton, Paul Champion and Rohan Wells (NIWA) for valuable discussions on management of invasive macrophytes in New Zealand.

However, many of the assumptions of SDMs may be violated when they are used to project species distributions across significant climate change events. In particular, SDM's in theory assume stable fundamental niches, but in practice, they assume stable realized niches. The assumption of a fixed realized niche relative to climate variables remains unlikely for various reasons, particularly if novel future climates open up currently unavailable portions of species fundamental niches. To demonstrate this effect, we compare the climate distributions for fossil-pollen data from 21 to 15 ka bp (relying on paleoclimate simulations) when communities and climates with no modern analog were common across North America to observed modern pollen assemblages. We test how well SDMs are able to project 20th century pollen-based taxon distributions with models calibrated using data from 21 to 15 ka. We find that taxa which were abundant in areas with no-analog late glacial climates, such as Fraxinus, Ostrya/Carpinus and Ulmus, substantially shifted their realized niches from the late glacial period to present. SDMs for these taxa had low predictive accuracy when projected to modern climates despite demonstrating high predictive accuracy for late glacial pollen distributions. For other taxa, e.g. Quercus, Picea, Pinus strobus, had relatively stable realized niches and models for these taxa tended to have higher predictive accuracy when projected to present. Our findings reinforce the point that a realized niche at any one time often represents only a subset of the climate conditions in which a taxon can persist. Projections from SDMs into future climate conditions that are based solely on contemporary realized distributions are potentially misleading for assessing the vulnerability of species to future climate change.",,,,"Blois, Jessica/G-5893-2011; Veloz, Samuel/Q-4973-2019; He, Feng/B-3583-2008","Blois, Jessica/0000-0003-4048-177X; Veloz, Samuel/0000-0003-3401-9167; He, Feng/0000-0002-3355-6406",Nelson Institute Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin; Focus on Energy Environmental and Economic Research Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0844223],"This work was supported by the Climate, People, and Environment Program at the Nelson Institute Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin, the Focus on Energy Environmental and Economic Research Program, and the National Science Foundation (EAR-0844223).

Migratory barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) rely heavily on terricolous lichens to sustain them through the winter months. Lichens preferred by caribou can take 50 or more years to recover after being consumed by wildfires. We simulated effects of climate change on the fire regime within the winter range of one of the largest caribou herds in the world, the Western Arctic Herd, to assess how their forage may be impacted. We forecast that the total area burned (AB) in the near term (2008-2053) will be 0-30% greater than during our historic reference period (1950-2007) depending on the climate model (CGCM3.1 or ECHAM5) considered. Further into the future (i.e., 2054-2099), we forecast AB to increase 25-53% more than during our reference period. In contrast to the entire study area, which contains both tundra and boreal forest habitats, we forecast that the amount of AB in tundra alone will increase (0-61%) in the near term. Simulated high-quality caribou winter range, as indexed by tundra and spruce habitat that had not burned in >= 50 years, decreased modestly (<6%) in the near term over the entire study area. Simulated changes were more dramatic within the herd's core winter range, with declines in high-quality caribou winter range approaching 30%. Conversely, moose habitat was projected to increase by 19-64% within the core winter range in the near term. The simulated declines in the quantity of core winter range in the future due to larger and more frequent fires could impact caribou abundance through decreased nutritional performance and/or apparent competition with moose. These impacts would likely be detrimental to the subsistence users that rely on this resource. Additionally, changes in the fire regime and decreases in caribou abundance could amplify feedback mechanisms, such as decreasing albedo, by facilitating shrub growth that may hasten climate-driven changes to the composition and structure of vegetation communities in the low Arctic.",,,,,"joly, kyle/0000-0001-8420-7452",National Park Service (Arctic Network Inventory and Monitoring Program); National Park Service (Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve); Bureau of Land Management (Central Yukon Field Office); Alaska Climate Science Center from the U.S. Geological Survey [G10AC00588],"Funding for this project was generously provided by the National Park Service (Arctic Network Inventory and Monitoring Program and Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve), the Bureau of Land Management (Central Yukon Field Office), and the Alaska Climate Science Center (Cooperative Agree-ment Number G10AC00588 from the U.S. Geological Survey).

Focusing on invasive plants in the US, which are estimated to generate costs of $US34.7 billion/year, we then combined this scheme with estimates of the per species expected economic losses associated with forgoing trade and with benchmark values for the economic costs associated with plant pests to obtain a decision tool that would maximize economic benefits. If used for screening, this tool is estimated to yield expected net benefits of $80,000-$ 140,000 per species assessed under very conservative estimates of losses due to invasion.",,,,,,USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [10-21-RR551],"Research was funded by USDA agreement no. 10-21-RR551 to John M.

Although appealing, these models ignore the genetic structure of species, and the fact that different populations might respond in different ways because of adaptation to their environment. Here, we introduced ancestry distribution models, that is, statistical models of the spatial distribution of ancestry proportions, for forecasting intra-specific changes based on genetic admixture instead of species occurrence data. Using multi-locus genotypes and extensive geographic coverage of distribution data across the European Alps, we applied this approach to 20 alpine plant species considering a global increase in temperature from 0.25 to 4 degrees C. We forecasted the magnitudes of displacement of contact zones between plant populations potentially adapted to warmer environments and other populations. While a global trend of movement in a north-east direction was predicted, the magnitude of displacement was species-specific. For a temperature increase of 2 degrees C, contact zones were predicted to move by 92 km on average (minimum of 5 km, maximum of 212 km) and by 188 km for an increase of 4 degrees C (minimum of 11 km, maximum of 393 km). Intra-specific turnovermeasuring the extent of change in global population genetic structurewas generally found to be moderate for 2 degrees C of temperature warming. For 4 degrees C of warming, however, the models indicated substantial intra-specific turnover for ten species. These results illustrate that, in spite of unavoidable simplifications, ancestry distribution models open new perspectives to forecast population genetic changes within species and complement more traditional distribution-based approaches.",,,,"THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Taberlet, Pierre/D-1178-2010; Francois, Olivier/A-6051-2012; Alvarez, Nadir/B-4318-2010; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019","THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Taberlet, Pierre/0000-0002-3554-5954; Francois, Olivier/0000-0003-2402-2442; Alvarez, Nadir/0000-0002-0729-166X; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; jay, flora/0000-0001-5884-4730","CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); La Region Rhone-AlpesRegion Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; Institut Universitaire de France; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PZ00P3_126624, AVE CRSI33_127155/1]; ANR EVORANGEFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-PEXT-011]","We are grateful to the INTRABIODIV Consortium for providing us the plant data.

Research needs to move beyond simple experimental studies and environmental envelope projections for single species towards identifying where ecosystem change is likely to occur and the drivers for this change. For this to happen, we advocate research directions that (i) identify the critical species within the target ecosystem, and the life stage(s) most susceptible to changing conditions and (ii) the key interactions between these species and components of their broader ecosystem.

Location Scandinavia, Europe. Methods The spreading dynamics of both species were analysed using a quantitative data-model comparison approach. Pollen data recording the arrival of the two species at 24 small forest-hollow sites distributed across the study area were compared with simulated arrival times. The simulations were based on diffusive spread combined with long-distance dispersal events. By systematically applying different parameter combinations yielding the desired colonization speeds we could identify values for the long-distance dispersal component that minimized deviations from the observed arrival times. Results According to the minimization process, the optimal spreading rates were 100 m year(-1) for F. sylvatica and 250 m year(-1) for P. abies. Simulated dispersal alone could adequately explain the wave-like spread of P. abies but failed to explain the scattered establishment pattern observed for F. sylvatica in Scandinavia. At the fine scale of stand establishment, local microclimatic conditions or site disturbance might be more important. The estimated spreading rates are high because the species colonized Scandinavia from different geographic directions and the rates slowed when their ranges overlapped. We present new estimates for the distance and frequency of long-distance dispersal events for our modelled species. Main conclusions Our analyses suggest that the late Holocene spread of P. abies in Scandinavia was fairly rapid and was limited only by biological processes of dispersal, while that of F. sylvatica was limited by other factors probably controlled by site properties. Picea abies has maintained a rapid and constant rate of spread throughout at least the last 4000 years, despite significant changes in climate. There is uncertainty about the precise relationship between P. abies and climate in Scandinavia, so future distributions are not easy to forecast. For F. sylvatica in Scandinavia, site quality appears to have been a limiting factor, so future land use is likely to dictate its future distribution dynamics in combination with climatic factors.",,,,"Bradley, Lee/AAA-6818-2019; Bialozyt, Ronald/I-2021-2014; Bradshaw, Richard HW/H-8663-2013","Bradley, Lee/0000-0003-0833-9351; Bialozyt, Ronald/0000-0003-0101-9443; Bradshaw, Richard HW/0000-0002-7331-2246",EU Network of Excellence EVOL-TREE,Financial support from the EU Network of Excellence EVOL-TREE is gratefully acknowledged.,,,11,11,2,43,,,,0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We use multiple tests of this prediction to distinguish amongst potential mechanistic hypotheses of responses to climate change. Location We sampled 97 locations on the Atlantic coast of Spain and France and the English Channel that span three hybrid zones formed between two species of marine mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. edulis). Methods Mussels were sampled in 2005-07 and analysed at a nuclear gene (Glu5') that is diagnostically differentiated between the subject species. Results were compared to those of studies made in the same region over the past two decades. Historical change in sea surface temperature (SST) was analysed using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation Daily SST. Species distribution models (random forest and maximum entropy) of the current distribution of mussels were constructed and validated by hindcasting the historical distributions of these species. Validated models were used in combination with forecasts of SST to predict changes in mussel distribution to 2050 and 2100. Results We show that over the past two decades two of the hybrid zones in France have not changed in either position or shape. The third hybrid zone, however, has shifted in the predicted direction, c. 100 km eastward into the warming English Channel. Species distribution modelling strongly implicates changes in winter cold SST as driving this change in the position of one of the hybrid zones. Forecasts of future SST indicate that rapid changes in distribution will occur over the next century. Main conclusions Hybrid zones can be used to conduct repeated tests of ecological responses to climate change and can be valuable in sorting among prospective mechanistic hypotheses that underlie that change. Winter temperatures, but not seasonal high temperature, appear to control the distribution of both species. Species distribution modelling indicates that the collapse of these hybrid zones is imminent, with the rapid expansion of the subtropical species in response to continuing SST warming.",,,,"Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014; Lima, Fernando P./C-1398-2008; Lourenco, Carla R./M-3661-2013","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Lima, Fernando P./0000-0001-9575-9834; Lourenco, Carla R./0000-0002-6837-0986; Hilbish, Thomas/0000-0001-9457-2461","NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA04-NOS4780264]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNG04GE43G, NNX07AF20G]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE1039513, OCE1129401]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia - FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/MAR/099391/2008, SFRH/BPD/34932/2007]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]","This research was supported by grants from NOAA (NA04-NOS4780264), NASA (NNG04GE43G and NNX07AF20G), NSF (OCE1039513, OCE1129401), and Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia - FCT (PTDC/MAR/099391/2008 and SFRH/BPD/34932/2007).

Location The case study focuses on Late Ordovician articulate brachiopods of the Cincinnati Arch in eastern North America. Methods Species niches were modelled for a suite of fossil brachiopod species based on five environmental variables inferred from sedimentary parameters using GARP and Maxent. Niche stability was assessed by comparison of (1) the degree of overlap of species distribution models developed for a time-slice and those generated by projecting niche models of the previous time-slice onto environmental layers of a second time-slice using GARP and Maxent, (2) Schoener's D statistic, and (3) the similarity of the contribution of each environmental parameter within Maxent niche models between adjacent timeslices. Results Late Ordovician brachiopod species conserved their niches with high fidelity during intervals of gradual environmental change but responded to interbasinal species invasions through niche evolution. Both native and invasive species exhibited similar levels of niche evolution in the invasion and post-invasion intervals. Niche evolution was related mostly to decreased variance within the former ecological niche parameters rather than to shifts to new ecospace. Main conclusions Although the species examined exhibited morphological stasis during the study interval, high levels of niche conservatism were observed only during intervals of gradual environmental change. Rapid environmental change, notably inter-basinal species invasions, resulted in high levels of niche evolution among the focal taxa. Both native and invasive species responded with similar levels of niche evolution during the invasion interval and subsequent environmental reorganization. The assumption of complete niche conservatism frequently employed in ecological niche modelling (ENM) analyses to forecast or hindcast species geographical distributions is more likely to be accurate for climate change studies than for invasive species analyses over geological time-scales.",,,,"Stigall, Alycia/C-7989-2013","Stigall, Alycia/0000-0002-4722-3303",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0922067]; American Chemical SocietyAmerican Chemical Society,"This paper is based on a presentation at the International Biogeography Society (IBS) biennial meeting held in Heraklion, Crete, on 7-11 January 2011.

Results indicated that none of the applied treatments was severe enough to induce a pronounced negative response of photosynthesis in this species well adapted to harsh Mediterranean conditions, but also highlighted important seasonal differences. Photosynthesis was limited by photoinhibition in spring and by stomatal closure in summer. Isoprenoid emission and the level of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were lower in summer than in spring, whereas pigment and total phenolic contents were generally higher in summer. Volatile isoprenoid emissions were largely inhibited by drought and were not stimulated by warming. Drought and warming increased the oxidation state of ascorbate and reduced total glutathione levels in spring, but not in summer.

Assessing the impacts of these changes on Africa's biodiversity is, however, plagued by uncertainties, and markedly different results can be obtained from alternative bioclimatic envelope models or future climate projections. Using an ensemble forecasting framework, we examine projections of future shifts in climatic suitability, and their methodological uncertainties, for over 2500 species of mammals, birds, amphibians and snakes in sub-Saharan Africa. To summarize a priori the variability in the ensemble of 17 general circulation models, we introduce a consensus methodology that combines co-varying models. Thus, we quantify and map the relative contribution to uncertainty of seven bioclimatic envelope models, three multi-model climate projections and three emissions scenarios, and explore the resulting variability in species turnover estimates. We show that bioclimatic envelope models contribute most to variability, particularly in projected novel climatic conditions over Sahelian and southern Saharan Africa. To summarize agreements among projections from the bioclimatic envelope models we compare five consensus methodologies, which generally increase or retain projection accuracy and provide consistent estimates of species turnover. Variability from emissions scenarios increases towards late-century and affects southern regions of high species turnover centred in arid Namibia. Twofold differences in median species turnover across the study area emerge among alternative climate projections and emissions scenarios. Our ensemble of projections underscores the potential bias when using a single algorithm or climate projection for Africa, and provides a cautious first approximation of the potential exposure of sub-Saharan African vertebrates to climatic changes. The future use and further development of bioclimatic envelope modelling will hinge on the interpretation of results in the light of methodological as well as biological uncertainties.

Applying such an approach to five species of Australian plants with contrasting demographic traits, we show that: (i) predicted climate-driven changes in range area are sensitive to the underlying habitat model, regardless of whether demographic traits and their interaction with habitat patch configuration are modeled explicitly; and (ii) caution should be exercised when using predicted changes in total habitat suitability or geographic extent to infer extinction risk, because the relationship between these metrics is often weak. Measures of extinction risk, which quantify threats to population persistence, are particularly sensitive to life-history traits, such as recruitment response to fire, which explained approximately 60% of the deviance in expected minimum abundance. Dispersal dynamics and habitat patch structure have the strongest influence on the amount of movement of the trailing and leading edge of the range margin, explaining roughly 40% of modeled structural deviance. These results underscore the need to consider direct measures of extinction risk (population declines and other measures of stochastic viability), as well as measures of change in habitat area, when assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity. Furthermore, direct estimation of extinction risk incorporates important demographic and ecosystem processes, which potentially influence species vulnerability to extinction due to climate change.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Elith, Jane/F-2022-2015; Akcakaya, H.

Climate change studies based on species distribution models (SDMs) have been criticized because they extend correlational relationships beyond the observed data. Here, we compared conventional climate-based SDMs against ecohydrological SDMs that include information from process-based simulations of water balance. We examined the current and future distribution of Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush) representing sagebrush ecosystems, which are widespread in semiarid western North America. For each approach, we calculated ensemble models from nine SDM methods and tested accuracy of each SDM with a null distribution. Climatic conditions included current conditions for 19701999 and two IPCC projections B1 and A2 for 20702099. Ecohydrological conditions were assessed by simulating soil water balance with SOILWAT, a daily time-step, multiple layer, mechanistic, soil water model. Under current conditions, both climatic and ecohydrological SDM approaches produced comparable sagebrush distributions. Overall, sagebrush distribution is forecasted to decrease, with larger decreases under the A2 than under the B1 scenario and strong decreases in the southern part of the range. Increases were forecasted in the northern parts and at higher elevations. Both SDM approaches produced accurate predictions. However, the ecohydrological SDM approach was slightly less accurate than climatic SDMs (-1% in AUC, -4% in Kappa and TSS) and predicted a higher number of habitat patches than observed in the input data. Future predictions of ecohydrological SDMs included an increased number of habitat patches whereas climatic SDMs predicted a decrease. This difference is important for understanding landscape-scale patterns of sagebrush ecosystems and management of sagebrush obligate species for future conditions. Several mechanisms can explain the diverging forecasts; however, we need better insights into the consequences of different datasets for SDMs and how these affect our understanding of future trajectories.",,,,"Schlaepfer, Daniel R/D-1756-2009; Bradford, John/E-5545-2011","Schlaepfer, Daniel R/0000-0001-9973-2065; Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303",Univ. of Wyoming; USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,The work was made possible by funding from the Univ. of Wyoming and the USDA Forest Service.

Statistical tools such as model selection and Bayesian decision analysis can guide decision-making by estimating probabilities of outcomes under alternative management scenarios, but these tools have seldom been applied in invasion ecology. We illustrate the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in a case study of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) invading Willapa Bay, Washington. To address uncertainty in model structure, we quantified the weight of evidence for two previously proposed hypotheses, that S. alterniflora recruitment varies with climatic conditions (represented by sea surface temperature) and that recruitment is subject to an Allee effect due to pollen limitation. By fitting models to time series data, we found strong support for climate effects, with higher per capita seedling production in warmer years, but no evidence for an Allee effect based on either the total area invaded or the mean distance between neighboring clones. We used the best-supported model to compare alternative control strategies, incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and population dynamics. For a fixed annual removal effort, the probability of eradication in 10 years was highest, and final invaded area lowest, if removals targeted the smallest clones rather than the largest or randomly selected clones. The relationship between removal effort and probability of eradication was highly nonlinear, with a sharp threshold separating similar to 0% and similar to 100% probability of success, and this threshold was 95% lower in simulations beginning early rather than late in the invasion. This advantage of a rapid response strategy is due to density-dependent population growth, which produces alternative stable equilibria depending on the initial invasion size when control begins. Our approach could be applied to a wide range of invasive species management problems where appropriate data are available.",,,,"Feist, Blake E/H-2669-2012","Feist, Blake E/0000-0001-5215-4878",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); ARCS Foundation,"Thanks to Brice Semmens, Wendy Palen, Mark Scheuerell, Kirstin Holsman, Jennifer Ruesink, Bob Paine, Daniel Schindler, and two anonymous reviewers for ideas and comments on the analysis and manuscript.

Refugia are habitats that components of biodiversity retreat to, persist in and can potentially expand from under changing environmental conditions. However, the study and discussion of refugia has often been ad hoc and descriptive in nature. We therefore: (1) provide a habitat-based concept of refugia, and (2) evaluate methods for the identification of refugia. Location Global. Methods We present a simple conceptual framework for refugia and examine the factors that describe them. We then demonstrate how different disciplines are contributing to our understanding of refugia, and the tools that they provide for identifying and quantifying refugia. Results Current understanding of refugia is largely based on Quaternary phylogeographic studies on organisms in North America and Europe during significant temperature fluctuations. This has resulted in gaps in our understanding of refugia, particularly when attempting to apply current theory to forecast anthropogenic climate change. Refugia are environmental habitats with space and time dimensions that operate on evolutionary time-scales and have facilitated the survival of biota under changing environmental conditions for millennia. Therefore, they offer the best chances for survival under climate change for many taxa, making their identification important for conservation under anthropogenic climate change. Several methods from various disciplines provide viable options for achieving this goal. Main conclusions The framework developed for refugia allows the identification and description of refugia in any environment. Various methods provide important contributions but each is limited in scope; urging a more integrated approach to identify, define and conserve refugia. Such an approach will facilitate better understanding of refugia and their capacity to act as safe havens under projected anthropogenic climate change.",,,,"Van Niel, Kimberly/A-4953-2010; Keppel, Gunnar/F-3767-2013; Lourenco, Carla R./M-3661-2013; Byrne, Margaret/H-8198-2015; Mucina, Ladislav/M-8875-2019; Mucina, Ladislav/B-6278-2012; Keppel, Gunnar/B-3364-2015; Mucina, Ladislav/A-6275-2019; AC, Stephen D.

Pathogen transmission potential within the host community is determined by the relative abilities of host species to maintain and transmit the pathogen and by ecological factors influencing contact rates between hosts and vectors. Increasing evidence of strong feeding preferences by a number of vectors suggests that the host community experienced by the pathogen may be very different from the local host community. We developed an empirically informed transmission model for West Nile virus (WNV) in four sites using one vector species (Culex pipiens) and preferred and non-preferred avian hosts. We measured strong feeding preferences for American robins (Turdus migratorius) by Cx. pipiens, quantified as the proportion of Cx. pipiens blood meals from robins in relation to their abundance (feeding index). The model accurately predicted WNV prevalence in Cx. pipiens at three of four sites. Sensitivity analysis revealed feeding preference was the most influential parameter on intensity and timing of peak WNV infection in Cx. pipiens and a threshold feeding index for transmission was identified.

Anticipating the potential effects of changes in species distributions requires models capable of forecasting population spread across realistic; heterogeneous landscapes and subject to spatiotemporal variability in habitat suitability. Several decades of theory and model development, as well as increased computing power and availability of fine-resolution GIS data, now make such models possible. Still unanswered, however, is the question of how well this new generation of dynamic models will anticipate range expansion. Here we develop a spatially explicit stochastic model that combines dynamic dispersal and population processes with fine-resolution maps characterizing spatiotemporal heterogeneity in climate and habitat to model range expansion of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae). We parameterize this model using multiyear data sets describing population and dispersal dynamics of HWA and apply it to eastern North America over a 57-year period (1951-2008). To evaluate the model, the observed pattern of spread of HWA during this same period was compared to model predictions. Our model predicts considerable heterogeneity in the risk of HWA invasion across space and through time, and it suggests that spatiotemporal variation in winter temperature, rather than hemlock abundance, exerts a primary control on the spread of HWA. Although the simulations generally matched the observed current extent of the invasion of HWA and patterns of anisotropic spread, it did not correctly predict when HWA was observed to arrive in different geographic regions. We attribute differences between the modeled and observed dynamics to an inability to capture the timing and direction of long-distance dispersal events that substantially affected the ensuing pattern of spread.",,,,"Preisser, Evan/C-3469-2013; Fitzpatrick, Matt/F-7620-2010","Preisser, Evan/0000-0002-8737-5619; Fitzpatrick, Matt/0000-0003-1911-8407; Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0715504]; UMCES-AL,"This work would not have been possible without contributions from Annie Paradis.

This cross-site analysis identified the plant species and functional types susceptible to climate change, the magnitude of their responses, and potential climate thresholds. In the relatively mesic mesquite savanna communities, perennial grasses declined with a decrease in annual precipitation, cacti increased, and there was a reversal of the Prosopis velutina expansion experienced in the 20th century in response to increasing mean annual temperature (MAT). In the more xeric Arizona Upland communities, the dominant leguminous tree, Cercidium microphyllum, declined on hillslopes, and the shrub Fouquieria splendens decreased, especially on south- and west-facing slopes in response to increasing MAT.

Results during nighttime of a typical warm-period day, depict a large cooling (on average greater than 5 degrees C) over the park's vegetated surface compared to current conditions, and a park cool island effect of 9.5 degrees C when comparing park and surrounding urban fabric air temperatures. Additionally, a significant cooling of the neighboring built-up areas is indicated at a radius proportional to the park's dimensions, related to the nocturnal advection of cool air beyond its borders (park breeze). During daytime, although no significant temperature changes over the park are simulated, a cooling (up to 1 degrees C) downwind its northern borders and over the inner city is predicted. This finding is related to the smaller frictional elements of the altered land cover located upon the axis of the seabreeze flow, which enhances the local sea-breeze circulation and its inland extent.

A large number of migratory bird species appear to be declining as the result of climate change, but whether resident bird species have or will be adversely affected by climate change is less clear. We focus on the South Hills crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex), which is endemic to about 70 km(2) of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) forest in southern Idaho, USA. 2. Our results indicate that the South Hills crossbill has declined by over 60% between 2003 and 2008, and that decreasing adult survival drives this population decline. 3. We evaluated the relative support for multiple hypotheses linking crossbill survival to climate, an ectoparasitic mite (scaly-leg mites Knemidokoptes jamaicensis), and the recent emergence of West Nile virus. Changes in adult apparent survival rate were closely associated with average spring and annual temperatures, and with high temperatures (>= 32 degrees C) during summer, which have increased during the last decade. In contrast, there was little evidence that scaly-leg mites or West Nile virus contributed to recent declines in adult survival. 4. The most probable mechanism causing the decline in adult survival and population size is a decrease in the availability of their primary food resource, seeds in serotinous pine cones. Cone production has declined with increasing annual temperatures, and these cones appear to be prematurely opening owing to increasingly hot summer conditions releasing their seeds and reducing the carrying capacity for crossbills later in the year. 5. In light of regional climate change forecasts, which include an increase in both annual temperature and hot days (>32 degrees C), and the likely disappearance of lodgepole pine from southern Idaho by the end of this century, additional research is needed to determine how to maintain lodgepole pine forests and their supply of seeds to conserve one of the few bird species endemic to the continental United States.",,,,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0212271, DEB-0435923]","We are grateful to T.

A change in a climate variable may alter a species abundance not only through a direct effect on that species vital rates, but also through indirect effects mediated by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect effects. 2. For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. 3. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. 4. Consistent with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. 5. Synthesis. Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches are necessary.

Metabolic processes in most aquatic ecosystems are supported by terrestrial detritus, which contributes to the production of organisms and the energetic stability of ecosystems. We suggest that conservation and management approaches to ecosystems along river networks must incorporate the organic-matter resources that support them. Understanding changes in the dynamics of detrital organic matter is particularly important because the quantity of this resource is decreasing and its qualities are being altered as a result of effects of current global changes. We summarize these effects in lotic ecosystems from reach- to network-scales and suggest future research questions aimed at adding quantitative rigor to our understanding of the interactions between dynamics of organic matter and ecological outcomes.

Here, we aimed at predicting the future breeding distributions of European birds under climate, land-use, and dispersal scenarios. We predicted current and future distributions of 409 species within an ensemble forecast framework using seven species distribution models (SDMs), five climate scenarios and three emission and land-use scenarios. We then compared results from SDMs using climate-only variables, habitat-only variables or both climate and habitat variables. In order to account for a species dispersal abilities, we used natal dispersal estimates and developed a probabilistic method that produced a dispersal scenario intermediate between the null and full dispersal scenarios generally considered in such studies. We then compared results from all scenarios in terms of future predicted range changes, range shifts, and variations in species richness. Modeling accuracy was better with climate-only variables than with habitat-only variables, and better with both climate and habitat variables. Habitat models predicted smaller range shifts and smaller variations in range size and species richness than climate models. Using both climate and habitat variables, it was predicted that the range of 71% of the species would decrease by 2050, with a 335km median shift. Predicted variations in species richness showed large decreases in the southern regions of Europe, as well as increases, mainly in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The partial dispersal scenario was significantly different from the full dispersal scenario for 25% of the species, resulting in the local reduction of the future predicted species richness of up to 10%. We concluded that the breeding range of most European birds will decrease in spite of dispersal abilities close to a full dispersal hypothesis, and that given the contrasted predictions obtained when modeling climate change only and land-use change only, both scenarios must be taken into consideration.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [GOCE-CT-2007-036866],We are grateful to Michel Bakkenes for providing the IMAGE scenarios and to Gail Wagman for carefully English editing the manuscript.

We examine the rates, magnitudes and uncertainties for major carbon (C) fluxes for rangelands due to commercial grazing and climate change in Australia. Total net C emission from biomass over 369 Mha of rangeland to-date was 0.73 (+/- 0.40) Pg, with 83% of that from the potentially forested 53% of the rangelands. A higher emission estimate is likely from a higher resolution analysis. The total Delta SOC to-date was -0.16 (+/- 0.05) Pg. Carbon emissions from all rangeland pools considered are currently 32 (+/- 10) Tg yr(-1) -equivalent to 21 (+/- 6)% of Australia's Kyoto-Protocol annual greenhouse gas emissions. The Delta SOC from erosion and deforestation was -4.0 (+/- 1.6) Tg yr(-1) -less than annual emissions from livestock methane, or biomass attrition, however it will continue for several centuries. Apart from deforestation a foci of land degradation was riparian zones. Cessation of deforestation and onset of rehabilitation of degraded rangeland would allow SOC recovery. If extensive rehabilitation started in 2011 and erosion ceased in 2050 then a Delta SOC of -1.2 (+/- 0.5) Pg would be avoided. The fastest sequestration option was maturation of regrowth forest in Queensland with a C flux of 0.36 (+/- 0.18) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in biomass across 22.7 Mha for the next 50 yr; equivalent to similar to 50% of national inventory agriculture emissions (as of mid 2011): and long-term sequestration would be 0.79 (+/- 0.40) Pg. Due to change in water balance, temperature and accompanying fire and drought regimes from climate change, the forecast Delta SOC from the forested rangelands to 0.3 m depth was -1.8 (0.6) Pg (i.e. 38 (12)% of extant SOC stock) resulting from a change in biomass from 2000 to 2100. For improved management of rangeland carbon fluxes: (a) more information is needed on the location of land degradation, and the dynamics and spatial variation of the major carbon pools and fluxes; and (b) freer data transfer is needed between government departments, and to the scientific community.

This is because disturbance affects key factors underlying social systems, such as demography, resource availability and genetic structure. However, because natural disturbances are unpredictable there is little information on their effects on social behaviour in wild populations. Here, we investigated how a major wildfire affected cooperation (sharing of hollow trees) by a hollow-dependent marsupial. We based two alternative social predictions on the impacts of fire on population density, genetic structure and resources. We predicted an adaptive social response from previous work showing that kin selection in den-sharing develops as competition for den resources increases. Thus, kin selection should occur in burnt areas because the fire caused loss of the majority of hollow-bearing trees, but no detectable mortality. Alternatively, fire may have a disruptive social effect, whereby postfire home range-shifts neutralize fine-scale genetic structure, thereby removing opportunities for kin selection between neighbours. Both predictions occurred: the disruptive social effect in burnt habitat and the adaptive social response in adjacent unburnt habitat. The latter followed a massive demographic influx to unburnt refuge habitat that increased competition for dens, leading to a density-related kin selection response. Our results show remarkable short-term plasticity of animal social behaviour and demonstrate how the social effects of disturbance extend into undisturbed habitat owing to landscape-scale demographic shifts. We predicted long-term changes in kinship-based cooperative behaviour resulting from the genetic and resource impacts of forecast changes to fire regimes in these forests.",,,,"Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017; Banks, Sam/K-4907-2012","Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; Banks, Sam/0000-0003-2415-0057",Hermon Slade Foundation (HSF) [08-4]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0984876],Dr Emma Knight and Prof. Jeff Wood provided advice on statistical analyses.

Its attractive location and moderate climate have since the mid-1960s brought increasing economic prosperity. As a result of the development of mass tourism, available land-use resources were widely exploited to create an integrated tourist industry. In this area, economic prosperity has led to an increasing population and a significant growth of infrastructures to cope with the demand from the hospitality sector. The far-reaching land-use changes have, however, led to high pressures on the coastal areas of the Algarve. This region has shown an increasing loss of ecosystems resulting from the expansion of urban areas. This paper proposes a dynamic assessment of urban growth in the Algarve based on non-linear complex system modelling by using cellular automata converging on qualitative story lines with quantitative spatial methodologies. This new methodology utilizes both quantitative and qualitative spatial results by a comparative validation of built scenarios, in order to highlight future land use trends. In particular, three scenarios will be explored, each with distinct specific socio-economic paths. Our analysis to identify the scenario with the best fit, based on the evolution of the actual 2006 land cover, enabled us to build a future urban growth model for 2020 which was quantitatively assessed. The outcome suggests a picture of continuing growth for the region of the Algarve within the framework of current policies and regressive spatial trends. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is a clear need for field experiments to estimate the effects of global climate change like decreasing precipitation and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. Adequate methods for controlled manipulations of these environmental parameters under field conditions are scarce, particularly in regard to multi-factor experiments. Here, we describe a new flexible rain shelter system, which can be assembled manually and easily be combined with further experimental treatments in field studies. 2. Frames of tents with a ground area of 12 m x 20 m were assembled on a field site after the sowing of the maize and sorghum crop and after the equipment for free-air CO2 enrichment has been set up. The tents were equipped with transparent tarpaulins, which were installed on the frames only in cases of high amounts of precipitations forecast. In autumn, the entire experimental equipment was removed from the field site. 3. The rain shelter tents were operated in the growing seasons 2008 and 2010 for 9 and 20 days with 54 mmand 176 mmof precipitation excluded, respectively. In the months with rain shelters in operation, pronounced reductions in precipitation were achieved 2008: 39 5%, 2010: 58 6%). The tent frames did not affect temperature or CO2 concentration, but slightly decreased incident photosynthetic active radiation PAR) by 6 6%. In times with tarpaulins installed, PAR decreased by 24 1%. Comparing times without and with tarpaulins installed, the fraction of time in which 1-min mean CO2 concentration was within similar to 20% limits of the setpoint was decreased from 99 7% to 97 8% in 2008 and from 99 0% to 96 7% in 2010, respectively. 4. The rain shelter tents provide a suitable and versatile tool for excluding precipitation from larger areas in the field without relevant disturbances to the soil and aerial environment except a slight decrease in incident radiation, which can be accounted for i. e. in the evaluation of plant growth data. Furthermore, they can be easily combined with further experimental treatments like free- air CO2 enrichment.",,,,,"Manderscheid, Remy/0000-0001-6975-0238","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LS05108, 0315421D]","The Johann Heinrich von Thunen-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Rural Areas, Forestry and Fisheries, Braunschweig, Germany, is part of the German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV).

These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.",,,,"Pagel, Joern/A-9897-2012","Pagel, Joern/0000-0002-4817-1920","University of Potsdam Graduate Initiative on Ecological Modelling (UPGradE); German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [GOCE-CT-2003-506675, 226701]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [MTKD-CT-2006-042261]","For helpful discussion we thank Wolfgang Cramer as well as Bob O'Hara, Otso Ovaskainen, Barbara Anderson and other members of the UKPopNet (NERC R8-H12-01 and English Nature) working group 'Bayesian distribution models: dynamics, processes and projections'.

In situ warming experiments accelerate climate change on a small scale to forecast responses of local plant communities. Limitations of this approach include the apparent site-specificity of results and uncertainty about the power of short-term studies to anticipate longer term change. We address these issues with a synthesis of 61 experimental warming studies, of up to 20 years duration, in tundra sites worldwide. The response of plant groups to warming often differed with ambient summer temperature, soil moisture and experimental duration. Shrubs increased with warming only where ambient temperature was high, whereas graminoids increased primarily in the coldest study sites. Linear increases in effect size over time were frequently observed. There was little indication of saturating or accelerating effects, as would be predicted if negative or positive vegetation feedbacks were common. These results indicate that tundra vegetation exhibits strong regional variation in response to warming, and that in vulnerable regions, cumulative effects of long-term warming on tundra vegetation and associated ecosystem consequences have the potential to be much greater than we have observed to date.",,,,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Kudo, Gaku/A-2733-2015; Myers-Smith, Isla H/D-1529-2013; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014; Bjorkman, Anne/H-2211-2016; Day, Thomas A/B-1462-2008; Schmidt, Niels Martin/G-3843-2011; Wookey, Philip/J-4786-2012; Keuper, Frida/L-2384-2017; Lang, Simone/AAE-5730-2020; Tolvanen, Anne/I-5873-2015; Wookey, Philip/AAA-6271-2020; Bjork, Robert G./I-9772-2019; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013; Alatalo, Juha/C-1269-2018; Hik, David S/B-3462-2009","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; Kudo, Gaku/0000-0002-6488-818X; Myers-Smith, Isla H/0000-0002-8417-6112; Bjorkman, Anne/0000-0003-2174-7800; Day, Thomas A/0000-0002-1582-4585; Schmidt, Niels Martin/0000-0002-4166-6218; Keuper, Frida/0000-0001-8673-7991; Tolvanen, Anne/0000-0002-5304-7510; Wookey, Philip/0000-0001-5957-6424; Bjork, Robert G./0000-0001-7346-666X; Alatalo, Juha/0000-0001-5084-850X; Hik, David S/0000-0002-8994-9305; Hollister, Robert/0000-0002-4764-7691; JARRAD, FRITH/0000-0003-4081-1310; Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521; Gould, William/0000-0002-3720-9735; Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988",U.S. National Science foundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Department of Sustainability and Environment; Parks Victoria; ArcticNet; Environment Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada; Polar Continental Shelf Program of Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources Canada; Yukon Territorial Government; Natural Sciences Division of the Danish Council for Independent Research; Danish Environmental Protection Agency; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland; Icelandic Research Fund; Ministry of Environment of Japan' s; Darwin Centre for Biogeosciences; EUEuropean Union (EU); Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of Norway; Norwegian Svalbard Society; Norwegian Polar Institute; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Swedish Research Council for EnvironmentSwedish Research Council Formas; Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas; UK Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; U.S. Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D005833/1],"We thank the Canadian IPY programme and the U.S. National Science foundation for funding this synthesis effort.

Here, we propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach to forecast the timing of a shift by combining uncertain prior information about the ecosystem dynamics (parameters and drivers) and sampled spatial and temporal correlation and variance of ecosystem states, which are well known early-warning signals. For an ecosystem of logistically growing vegetation under linear increase in grazing pressure, we show that the use of sampled early-warning signals results in lower prediction uncertainty in forecasted timing of shifts compared to forecasts made with sampled mean state variables. In addition, we show that uncertainty in ecosystem parameters decreases well ahead of a shift. An important conclusion of our study is that the use of early-warning signals in forecasting of shifts is promising, provided that a large number of samples are collected (n approximate to 10(4) in our study).

Lakes provide essential ecosystem goods and services on which humans depend, and are integral to many global biogeochemical cycles, yet are sensitive to environmental perturbation operating at global, regional and local scales, many resulting from human influence.2. The complex web of external stressors and internal interactions that control the biological structure and ecological function of lakes requires a ` systems approach', where different trophic levels are studied and different approaches including long-term monitoring are taken. 3. This Special Issue celebrates the ecological insights that have been gained from long-term monitoring and research on the lakes in the catchment of Windermere in the English Lake District. The research was started by the Freshwater Biological Association in the 1930s and has been continued by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology since 1989 to produce a valuable record of lake response to changing conditions extending over 65 years. 4. We introduce a conceptual diagram of lake response and feedbacks to a hierarchy of conditions at different scales and interactions within the lake and illustrate it using the contributions of papers in the literature and this Special Issue. 5. Long-term monitoring is often threatened at times of economic austerity, yet its continuation as part of a programme of research is a key activity that can produce mechanistic understanding and insights, and data to produce and validate models, and hence forecast future responses.

Many established weather-based prediction models do not accurately predict FEB severity in the UK. One weather-based model developed with UK data suggests a slight increase in FEB severity as a direct effect of climate change. However, severity of the disease is likely to increase further due to indirect effects of climate change, such as increased cropping of grain maize, since maize debris is a potent source of inoculum of F. graminearum. To guide strategies for adaptation to climate change, further research on forecasting, management options to reduce mycotoxin production, and breeding for resistant varieties is a high priority for the UK. Adaptation strategies must also consider factors such as tillage regime, wheat cultivar (flowering time and disease resistance) and fungicide use, which also influence the severity of FEB and related toxin production.

In this context, it is important to understand the decision-making behaviour of farmers regarding investments in renewable energy systems that generate energy from biomass and farmers' reactions to investment-support measures. To study this behaviour, we conduct a survey and confront farmers with a hypothetical opportunity to invest in a biogas plant. Our findings reveal that farmers have heterogeneous investment thresholds. Their investment decisions are mainly driven by capital costs and the subjective perception of the risk resulting from the investment. Other decision parameters like sustainability and non-monetary objectives that are also examined in this paper, play only minor roles. However, bounded rationality is an important factor. Moreover, the influence of an investment subsidy was analysed. Only about half of the amount of the subsidy - as expected according to normative forecast models - is reflected in an increased willingness to invest. Furthermore, farmers who have previously invested in bioenergy plants show lower investment thresholds and have stronger reactions to the subsidy. Regarding the expansion of renewable energies these findings are meaningful for policy impact analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of our research is to present a novel approach to predict the migratory movement of birds. Using a blue-winged teal case study, our process incorporates not only constraints on habitat (temperature, precipitation, elevation, and depth to water table), but also approximates the likely bearing and distance traveled from a starting location. The method allows for movement predictions to be made from unsampled areas across large spatial scales. We used USGS' Bird Banding Laboratory database as the source of banding and recovery locations. We used recovery locations from banding sites with multiple within-30-day recoveries were used to build core maximum entropy models. Because the core models encompass information regarding likely habitat, distance, and bearing, we used core models to project (or forecast) probability of movement from starting locations that lacked sufficient data for independent predictions. The final model for an unsampled area was based on an inverse-distance weighted averaged prediction from the three nearest core models. To illustrate this approach, three unsampled locations were selected to probabilistically predict where migratory blue-wing teals would stopover. These locations, despite having little or none data, are assumed to have populations. For the blue-winged teal case study, 104 suitable locations were identified to generate core models. These locations ranged from 20 to 228 within-30-day recoveries, and all core models had AUC scores greater than 0.80. We can infer based on model performance assessment, that our novel approach to predicting migratory movement is well-grounded and provides a reasonable approximation of migratory movement.

Understanding the sources of this variability will contribute to the knowledge of fruit developmental physiology and may also benefit commercial fruit production via altered managements that reduce it or forecasts that predict it. A causal-chain relationship is proposed to help elucidate the sources of variability in fruit storage quality: the weather -> (i) -> fruit transpiration -> (ii) -> fruit calcium -> (iii) -> fruit storage quality. This paper explores the first link of this hypothesis, -> (i)->, for Hayward kiwifruit using field measurements of fruit transpiration rate and concurrent meteorological recordings. The aims are to identify the key environmental variables driving fruit transpiration and develop a predictive fruit transpiration model. Methodology Fruit transpiration was determined hourly over several 24-h periods by recording weight loss of detached fruit, on Days 23, 35, 49, 65, 94 and 140 after full bloom. Meteorological records were made every 15 min throughout the season at an adjacent regional weather station. A model of fruit transpiration was developed in which the usual meteorological variables (radiation, temperature, windspeed and relative humidity) were incorporated in a Fick's Law transpiration flux equation. Principal results Fruit transpiration rate (i.e. the molar flux density, mmol cm(-2) h(-1)) varied diurnally and decreased during the season. The dominant fruit variable governing transpiration rate was skin conductance and the dominant environmental variables were relative humidity and temperature. Radiation and windspeed were not significantly influential. Conclusions The model provides a good fit to the fruit transpiration rate measurements regardless of the time of day/night or the stage of fruit development. The model allows reasonably accurate and continuous predictions of fruit transpiration rate throughout fruit development based on standard meteorological recordings. It also allows estimates of cumulative fruit transpiration throughout the season.",,,,"Soh, Ping Jack/C-7255-2008; Montanaro, Giuseppe/F-4354-2012; Montanaro, Giuseppe/Z-1208-2019; Vandenbosch, Guy A/J-3209-2012; Karsmakers, Peter/AAC-1294-2020","Soh, Ping Jack/0000-0002-6394-5330; Montanaro, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1172-7526; Montanaro, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1172-7526; Karsmakers, Peter/0000-0001-8119-6823","Italian Ministry of University ResearchMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); Rientro Cervelli","This research was partially funded by three programmes of the Italian Ministry of University Research: PRIN2005, PRIN2009 and Rientro Cervelli.",,,23,24,2,28,,,,2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2012,,,,,,,,,pls036,10.1093/aobpla/pls036,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology,,,WOS:000325264100020,23136639,,,,

The water environmental carrying capacity evaluation model was established according to simulations of socio-economic activity. Our model can forecast the value of assessment indicators to represent their impact degree, which is brought about by socio-economic activities. Next, an entropy indicator assessment method was proposed to analyze the changes in environmental water carrying capacity and to obtain key indicators. The results demonstrate that the industrial park's development can be supported within the carrying capacity of the current environmental water resources.

Then it provides various fluxes from the bay interior to landscapes located along coastal zone, and it supports ecosystem there. Fishery is a kind of ecosystem service there. We focused on bivalve, Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) because it uses various landscapes in a bay through its life cycle and it provides fishery activity as ecosystem service. We have developed TB1 and TB2 also in bay area successfully. Then, we evaluate the transition of quality of environments of RBC including Ise bay from the past to the present by using TB1-TB3 for river basin and bay area. Furthermore, we forecast the future situation and then we discuss how we can improve it through various combinations of measures and policies in the RBC as well as in the bay.

This model differs from previous urban emergy models by monitoring the negative effects to human well-being and ecosystem integrity in the developing urban system. A fresh perspective focuses on urban comprehensive performance linking such impacts to a supply-side environmental cost evaluation ( including ecological service supply, ecological and economic losses and investment for treatment). In this introductory paper, we present the conceptual considerations of the most important components of the emergy-based urban dynamic model: the urban assets, lands, capitals, population, water resources, economic and environmental loss. Each subsystem in this model will enrich the feedback dynamics, policy levers and post-scenario analyses. Statistical Information and calibration are also considered in this dynamic emergy accounting. This study advances the temporal dynamic principles of emergy accounting through integrating upstream and downstream evaluation methods to quantify the environmental impact by addressing specific damages to human health and ecosystem's integrity and by linking such impacts to a supply-side environmental cost evaluation.

Few thoughts have given to the analysis of modal accuracy and uncertainty and previous accuracy assessments have largely been conducted by simply calculating the overall value of selected accuracy metric. To increase the applied assessment value of Markov-cellular automata model, we explored the accuracy of simulation through the calculation of Kappa index for location and quantity. The case study area was Changping District, which is a rapidly growing area of Beijing. We classified the 1988 and 1995 TM image into six land use types in accordance with Chinese standards. Computed the transition suitable atlas based on different range and measurement units of the physical and socioeconomic factors. And then, we integrated these datasets to simulate the 2000 land use change map by Markov-cellular automata model. Lastly, we analyzed the simulation result and assess the accuracy of different cell size and neighbour size through various kappa index. The results of simulation showed that simulation accuracy of small cell size is better than the big cell size although it takes a substantial amount of time to run. However, the prediction accuracy of the model was quite stable with the neighbour sizes from 3*3 to 13*13. These results allowed us to understand what and how the factor including cell size and neighbour size affected simulation accuracy and how to select the best cell size for simulation.

In coastal ecosystems the passage of a hurricane is associated with increases in nutrients that may cause subsequent increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. Zooplankton are an important food source for small fishes that are feed on by larger fishes, thus commercial and recreational fisheries could benefit from the passage of a hurricane. NPZD simulations of hurricane scenarios are used to assess the magnitude and resilience of secondary production after the passage of hurricanes with different wind speeds and directions of approach. Short-term increase and recovery of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass after the passage of hurricanes suggests short-term increase in fish biomass, and a potential benefit to some commercial and recreational fisheries.

The Manwan Dam, the first of the 14 dams, began operating in 1993, and the associated downstream runoff may have been affected by its construction. To assess this impact, we first investigated the relationships between monthly runoff observed from the Gajiu station and meteorological data obtained from four meteorological gauging stations with a time-lag of 0-3 months over the pre-dam period (1957-2000). Second, we established and validated a multiple linear regression equation employing monthly meteorological and hydrological data during the pre-dam period. Finally, we simulated the monthly runoff after dam construction (1993-2000) using the established equations and assessed the impact of dam construction on runoff by comparing the observed actual monthly runoff with the simulated monthly runoff. Our results suggested a very high hydro-meteorological correlation for the pre-dam period, which opened up the possibility of runoff forecasting. Further, the multiple linear regression equation displayed good simulation performance as coefficient of determination (R-2) and the Nash-Suttcliffe coefficient (NS) reached 0.84 and 0.82 respectively. By comparing the observed and the predicted monthly runoff, we found that construction of the Manwan Dam caused a visible disturbance on monthly runoff that, with the disturbance value, displayed a multi-peak fluctuation of up-down variation in the annual hydrologic regime circle.

We developed a method for assessing CC effects on population dynamics based on analyzing plastic life history responses to weather conditions within an ensemble forecasting framework. The method is illustrated using two threatened cactus species with contrasting distribution ranges. Demographic models were parameterized using 5 years of field data, from which the relationship between life-history traits and rainfall and temperature was estimated. These functions were used in Integral Projection Models to predict population growth under CC scenarios and different anthropogenic disturbance regimes. Both species were affected by CC and its interaction with disturbance. The most widespread species was less affected by CC, suggesting that past selection on plasticity allows it to survive under variable conditions. Managing disturbance appropriately lessened the impact of CC. Some directives for conservation under CC were identified based on projected elasticity values. Our procedure for modeling population dynamics as a function of climate may be used for designing management plans for conservation or sustainable use aimed at important plant sizes or life-history traits, predicting potential distributions, and identifying viable populations.

The three methods were used to build consensus around the significance of the apparent declines in total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations following two interventions: (1) point-source phosphorus loading reductions of about 50% to the upper bay in the winter of 19771978 and (2) the establishment of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the early to mid-1990's. The methods were applied to May to October monthly means and included: (1) nonparametric tests that accounted for persistence and seasonality and determined the statistical significance of step-trends, (2) ARIMA-Intervention modelling that produced forecasts into post-intervention time periods that were compared statistically to measured data and (3) regime shift detection for identifying the significance of persistent steps after removal of the seasonal components of the data series (modelled as periodic functions). Strong gradients in total phosphorus (TP) and Chl-a concentrations between the upper and lower Bay of Quinte still existed three decades after reductions in point-source loadings of TP to the upper bay, where, during 20002008, May-October average TP was 3.8 times higher and Chl-a, 2.9 times higher than in the lower bay. The Remedial Action Plan May-October TP objective of 0.030 mg l-1 for the upper Bay of Quinte was not achieved consistently in recent years. Concurrence among the data analysis methods suggests that the relative decreases in the upper bay TP (31%) and Chl-a (37%) after phosphorus loading reductions were greater than in the lower bay (0% and 10%, respectively). The relative decreases in the upper bay TP (0%) and Chl-a (29%) associated with Dreissena establishment were less than those measured in the lower bay (20% and 50%, respectively).",,,,,,,,,,3,4,1,34,,,,1463-4988,1539-4077,,AQUAT ECOSYST HEALTH,Aquat.

However, assigning a certain successional stage to forests in nature is challenging, especially when long-lived tree species dominate succession. Temperate rainforests commonly harbor emergent pioneer trees with long lifespans (>500 years) and may persist even when forest have reached stability in tree species composition (compositional equilibrium) and stability in structure (e.g. biomass). Thus, it is difficult to locate stands along a successional trajectory. Here, we propose a method for identifying the successional stages of forests using a dynamic forest model that estimate the time taken for a forest to reach the late successional stage, i.e. when forests have reached stability. Using this method, we examined the successional stages of 13 old, unmanaged stands of temperate rainforests located on Chiloe Island (Chile, 42 degrees S). We parameterized the model for 17 tree species using field data and a comprehensive literature search. The model predicted varied successional pathways for reproducing the observed structural variability of studied forests stands. Model results suggest that forests in this region can take 490-850 years to reach the late successional stage. We found 6 out of the 13 studied forests represent a transient successional stage. Forest stands in the late successional stage commonly contained pioneer species with basal area <20 m(2)/ha. According to our simulations, pioneers can persist until the late successional stage because of their long lifespans and the occurrence of small canopy openings (<1.6 ha) produced by windstorms. Above-ground biomass in the studied forests (estimated at 539 t/ha, average among stands) tended to decrease as forests approach the late successional stage because large pioneers are replaced by smaller late-successional trees. These results can assist in the classification of natural forest according to their successional stages as well as in developing management and conservation strategies of primary forests in this region.

Here, we test this hypothesis by linking variation in prey resources during the initial phase at sea with measurements of central California Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha diet, condition, and later adult abundance. Specifically, we investigate linkages between the distribution and abundance of krill and other prey with juvenile Chinook salmon diet and body condition. Hydrographic features of the Gulf of the Farallones during May and June were related to the abundance and spatial organization of Chinook salmon prey. When upwelling was reduced, there were fewer krill on the inner Gulf of the Farallones shelf, thereby less available to outgoing juvenile Chinook salmon smolts. Notably, we found a 1 yr lag in the relationship between the abundance of adult Thysanoessa spinifera and the volume of krill in the diet of juvenile Chinook salmon. Body condition of juvenile Chinook salmon was positively related to the abundance of adult krill the year before and specifically to the proportion of T. spinifera in the diet. In turn, the condition of juvenile Chinook salmon was correlated to the abundance of mature Chinook salmon returning from the same cohort the next year.

Terrestrial biosphere models, however, are known to have systematic errors in the simulation of spring phenology, which potentially could propagate to uncertainty in modeled responses to future climate change. Here, we used the Harvard Forest phenology record to investigate and characterize sources of uncertainty in predicting phenology, and the subsequent impacts on model forecasts of carbon and water cycling. Using a model-data fusion approach, we combined information from 20 yr of phenological observations of 11 North American woody species, with 12 leaf bud-burst models that varied in complexity. Akaike's Information Criterion indicated support for spring warming models with photoperiod limitations and, to a lesser extent, models that included chilling requirements. We assessed three different sources of uncertainty in phenological forecasts: parameter uncertainty, model uncertainty, and driver uncertainty. The latter was characterized running the models to 2099 using 2 different IPCC climate scenarios (A1fi vs. B1, i.e. high CO2 emissions vs. low CO2 emissions scenario). Parameter uncertainty was the smallest (average 95% Confidence Interval - CI: 2.4 days century(-1) for scenario B1 and 4.5 days century(-1) for A1fi), whereas driver uncertainty was the largest (up to 8.4 days century(-1) in the simulated trends). The uncertainty related to model structure is also large and the predicted bud-burst trends as well as the shape of the smoothed projections varied among models (+/- 7.7 days century-1 for A1fi, +/- 3.6 days century(-1) for B1). The forecast sensitivity of bud-burst to temperature (i. e. days bud-burst advanced per degree of warming) varied between 2.2 days degrees C-1 and 5.2 days degrees C-1 depending on model structure. We quantified the impact of uncertainties in bud-burst forecasts on simulated photosynthetic CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration (ET) using a process-based terrestrial biosphere model. Uncertainty in phenology model structure led to uncertainty in the description of forest seasonality, which accumulated to uncertainty in annual model estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ET of 9.6% and 2.9%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis shows that a variation of +/- 10 days in bud-burst dates led to a variation of +/- 5.0% for annual GPP and about +/- 2.0% for ET. For phenology models, differences among future climate scenarios (i. e. driver) represent the largest source of uncertainty, followed by uncertainties related to model structure, and finally, related to model parameterization.

Regional simulators can help forecast available wood and biomass and allow evaluation of possible future conflicts of interest and their consequences for society. This paper focuses on improving an existing regional forest simulator (SIMPLOT) so that it can be applied to study research questions related to increasing the use of eucalyptus biomass for bioenergy and the related consequences for wood available for pulp. Biomass modules were integrated into SIMPLOT so that different sources of biomass used for energy could be accounted for. The updated version of the simulator was used to assess the impact of different biomass demands for bioenergy, combined with different afforestation alternatives on the wood available for the pulp and paper industry in Portugal. SIMPLOT's forecasts indicated that the eucalyptus forest is unable to satisfy wood demand even when pulp afforestation areas are doubled, regardless of the biomass demand considered. Also, the simulation results showed that, with the tested afforestation rates, eucalyptus forest cannot meet high increases in demand for wood.",,,,"Barreiro, Susana M/I-5673-2012; Tome, Margarida/F-5776-2010","Barreiro, Susana M/0000-0003-0174-854X; Tome, Margarida/0000-0002-6242-8593","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/31239/2006]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [518128, CP-IP 228589-2 AFORE]",The research leading to these results is part of the PhD studies of the first author and is supported by grant SFRH/BD/31239/2006 of the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).

J,"Foote, L",,,,"Foote, Lee",,,Threshold Considerations and Wetland Reclamation in Alberta's Mineable Oil Sands,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,environmental constraints; limits; oil sands; reclamation; thresholds; time frames,,"Oil sand extraction in Alberta, Canada is a multibillion dollar industry operating over 143 km(2) of open pit mining and 4600 km(2) of other bitumen strata in northern boreal forests. Oil production contributes to Canada-wide GDP, creates socio-cultural problems, provides energy exports and employment, and carries environmental risks regarding long-term reclamation uncertainties. Of particular concern are the implications for wetlands and water supply management. Mining of oil sands is very attractive because proven reserves of known quality occur in an accessible, politically stable environment with existing infrastructure and an estimated 5.5 billion extractable barrels to be mined over the next five decades. Extraction occurs under a set of limiting factors or thresholds including: limited social tolerance at local to international levels for externalities of oil sand production; water demands > availability; limited natural gas supplies for oil processing leading to proposals for hydroelectric dams and nuclear reactors to be constructed; difficulties in reclaiming sufficient habitat area to replace those lost. Replacement of the 85 km(2) of peat-forming wetlands forecast to be destroyed appears unlikely. Over 840 billion liters of toxic fluid by products are currently held in 170 km(2) of open reservoirs without any known process to purify this water in meaningful time frames even as some of it leaches into adjacent lands and rivers. Costs for wetland reclamation are high with estimates of $ 4 to $ 13 billion, or about 6% of the net profits generated from mining those sites. This raises a social equity question of how much reclamation is appropriate. Time frames for economic, political, and ecological actions are not well aligned. Local people on or near mine sites have had to change their area use for decades and have been affected by industrial development. Examining mining effects to estimate thresholds of biophysical realities, time scales, economic allocations, and social tolerance helps to contextualize the needs for decision making and relevant policy formation as a way of constructively reconciling production with governing safeguards to the environment and citizens.",,,,,"Foote, Lee/0000-0001-8003-0813",,,,,20,20,0,93,,,,1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Methods were developed to measure late-larval stage abundance and sizes at-sea and to use such data in a near real-time model to forecast recruitment about 4 yr in advance. Larval abundances were weighted for size-and temperature-dependent mortality to project the number attaining a critical size of 15 mm; this weighting reflects the greater survival value of larger larvae to the population. The method was applied to catches in the 2007 and 2008 larval surveys to show the feasibility of attaining near real-time estimates. The accuracy of the method to forecast recruitment was evaluated from historical data. Adjusting larval abundance for size-and temperature-dependent mortality improved the trend with recruitment, but the relationship was not significant over the entire time series (1979 to 2007) because of an increasing trend in predators of juvenile stages, decoupling the parameters. A threshold-based generalized additive recruitment forecast model was developed to account for autocorrelative structure caused by inter-cohort interactions and mortality-related factors occurring after the larval period. The model closely tracks past recruitment trends. Based on low larval abundances and high numbers of predators, low to moderate abundances of age-4 recruits were predicted for 2007 to 2011, which matched observed levels reasonably well.",,,,,,,,,,10,10,0,10,,,,0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The uncertainty associated with the introduction and spread of invasive organisms influences how pest management decision makers respond to expanding incursions. We present a model-based approach to map risk of ecological invasions that combines two potentially conflicting goals: (1) estimating the likelihood of a new organism being established at a given locale and (2) quantifying the uncertainty of that prediction. Location Eastern and central Canada. Methods Our methodology focuses on the potential for long-distance, human-assisted spread of invasive organisms. First, we used a spatial simulation model to generate distributions of plausible invasion outcomes over a target geographical region. We then used second-degree stochastic dominance (SSD) criteria to rank all geographical locations in the target region based on these distributions. We applied the approach to analyze pathways of human-assisted spread (i.e., with commercially transported goods) of the emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), a major pest of ash trees in North America. Results The projected potential of the pest to establish at remote locations is significantly shaped by the amount of epistemic uncertainty in the model-based forecasts. The estimates based on the SSD ranking identified major 'crossroads' through which the movement of the EAB with commercial transport is most likely to occur. The system of major expressways in Ontario and Quebec was confirmed as the primary gateway of the pest's expansion throughout the Canadian landscape. Main conclusions Overall, the new approach generates more realistic predictions of long-distance introductions than models that do not account for severe uncertainties and thus can help design more effective pest surveillance programmes. The modelling technique is generic and can be applied to assess other environmental phenomena when the level of epistemic uncertainty is high.",,,,"Ducey, Mark/K-1101-2016","Koch, Frank/0000-0002-3750-4507; Ducey, Mark/0000-0002-2027-1188","NRCan - CFIA Forest Invasive Alien Species initiativeNatural Resources Canada; USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Asheville, NCUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [10-JV-11330146-064]; North Carolina State University [10-JV-11330146-064]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2010-85605-20584]","The authors extend their gratitude and thanks to Kirsty Wilson and Marty Siltanen (Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service) for technical support and diligence with preparing the Canadian roadside database and helping undertake the pathway modelling study; Marcel Dawson, Julia Dunlop and Annie Baxter (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) for help with acquiring the Canadian roadside database.

The first step is to determine if the monitoring data formed a time series, if the time series is stationary and if there is any significant seasonality that needs to be modeled. The data that result from the monitor of the degree of environmental pollution in a target zone form a time series because it shows variability and homogeneity.

Drying disturbances applied at high (monthly) and low (quarterly) frequency over 21-months had contrasting effects on the structure and temporal dynamics of the communities. Macroinvertebrates were resilient to low-frequency disturbance, sustaining abundant and diverse communities, which developed over experimental time. By comparison, high-frequency disturbance exceeded the capacity for recovery, skewing community structure, and generated relatively impoverished, static assemblages dominated by fewer species. Species responses ranged from extirpation to irruption, with smaller short-lived taxa (<= 1 generation per year), notably chironomids and worms, replacing larger taxa with longer life cycles (>= 1 generation per year).

It is the site of both regular (seasonal) biomass burning associated with deforestation, land cover change and agricultural production preparations, and occasional, but much more severe, extreme fire episodes releasing enormous volumes of carbon from burning vegetation and peat. These extreme fire episodes are believed to result from anthropogenic practices related to (the still ongoing) forest degradation and clearance activities, whose impact with regard to fire is magnified by the effects of El Nino related drought. Since 2000, data from the MODIS Earth Observation satellite instruments have been used to study fire on Borneo, but earlier large fire events remain less well documented. Here we focus on a series of large fire episodes prior to the MODIS era, and specifically a 20 yr period covering both the two strongest El Nino events on record (1997-1998 and 1982-1983), along with an unprecedented series of more frequent, but weaker, El Ninos. For the five El Ninos occurring between 1980 and 2000, we develop quantitative measures of the fire activity across Borneo based on active fire counts derived from NOAA AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) Earth Observation satellite data. We use these metrics to investigate relationships between the strength and timing of the El Nino event, the associated drought, and the fire activity. During each El Nino, we find areas of major fire activity confined within two or three fire sub-seasons (separated by monsoons) and focused in parts of South and Central Kalimantan, and sometimes also in East and/or West Kalimantan. For each El Nino we investigate various lag correlations, and find relationships of similar strength between monthly rainfall deficit and fire, but of more variable strength between indices of El Nino strength (ENSO indices) and rainfall deficit. The two strongest El Nino episodes (1982-1983 and 1997-1998) are accompanied by the most abundant fires (two and three times the active fire count seen in the next largest fire year), and the strongest correlations between measures of El Nino strength, rainfall and fire. We find the most significant positive statistical association between an ENSO index and fire activity to be that between the 16-month (first and second fire sub-seasons) cumulative NINO3 anomaly and the simultaneously recorded active fire count (r = 0.98, based on the five El Nino episodes between 1980 and 2000), although we find a negative association of equal strength between the cumulative NINO4 index and active fire count when considered over the entire two year duration of each El Nino episode (first, second and third fire sub-seasons). Our results confirm that the El Nino phenomenon, via its effect on precipitation, is a primary large-scale, short-term climatic factor that has a strong control on the magnitude of the fire activity resulting from the numerous land cover changes, agricultural preparation practices and human-caused ignitions occurring annually across Borneo. The results also suggest that ENSO forecasting maybe a realistic means of estimating the extent and magnitude of this fire activity some months in advance, thus offering some potential for forecasting effects on the remaining forest and peatland resource and the regional atmosphere.",,,,,"Perry, George/0000-0001-9672-9135; Wooster, Martin/0000-0001-6375-7949","NERC QUESTNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F001584/1]; State Scholarships Foundation (IKY) of Greece; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F001681/1, NE/F001584/1, earth010003, NE/F001592/1, NE/F00169X/1, NE/F001673/1]","We are grateful for the station rainfall data for the Indonesian part of Borneo provided to us by Dewi Kirono and Nigel Tapper (Monash University, Australia) and collected originally by the Indonesian Bureau of Meteorology and Geophysics (Badan Meteorologi dan Geofisika, BMG).

It corrects for gaps in the observations, which are mostly due to cloud cover, and filters spurious FRP observations of volcanoes, gas flares and other industrial activity. The combustion rate is subsequently calculated with land cover-specific conversion factors. Emission factors for 40 gas-phase and aerosol trace species have been compiled from a literature survey. The corresponding daily emissions have been calculated on a global 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid from 2003 to the present. General consistency with the Global Fire Emission Database version 3.1 (GFED3.1) within its accuracy is achieved while maintaining the advantages of an FRP-based approach: GFASv1.0 makes use of the quantitative information on the combustion rate that is contained in the FRP observations, and it detects fires in real time at high spatial and temporal resolution. GFASv1.0 indicates omission errors in GFED3.1 due to undetected small fires. It also exhibits slightly longer fire seasons in South America and North Africa and a slightly shorter fire season in Southeast Asia. GFASv1.0 has already been used for atmospheric reactive gas simulations in an independent study, which found good agreement with atmospheric observations. We have performed simulations of the atmospheric aerosol distribution with and without the assimilation of MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD). They indicate that the emissions of particulate matter need to be boosted by a factor of 2-4 to reproduce the global distribution of organic matter and black carbon. This discrepancy is also evident in the comparison of previously published top-down and bottom-up estimates. For the time being, a global enhancement of the particulate matter emissions by 3.4 is recommended. Validation with independent AOD and PM10 observations recorded during the Russian fires in summer 2010 show that the global Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Change (MACC) aerosol model with GFASv1.0 aerosol emissions captures the smoke plume evolution well when organic matter and black carbon are enhanced by the recommended factor. In conjunction with the assimilation of MODIS AOD, the use of GFASv1.0 with enhanced emission factors quantitatively improves the forecast of the aerosol load near the surface sufficiently to allow air quality warnings with a lead time of up to four days.",,,,"Kaiser, Johannes W/A-7057-2012; Chubarova, Natalia Ye./F-2694-2014; Heil, Angelika/J-7182-2012; Schultz, Martin G/I-9512-2012; van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016; Andreae, Meinrat O/B-1068-2008","Kaiser, Johannes W/0000-0003-3696-9123; Heil, Angelika/0000-0002-8768-5027; Schultz, Martin G/0000-0003-3455-774X; van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; Andreae, Meinrat O/0000-0003-1968-7925; Benedetti, Angela/0000-0002-9971-9976",EUEuropean Union (EU) [218793],"We thank Hugo Dernier van der Gon, Zig Klimont, Stefan Kinne for valuable discussions and Mikhail A.

In this study, we used a formal framework to assess species vulnerability to climate change quantifying exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and then used this information to target areas for reducing vulnerability at a regional scale. Location The 6500-km(2) Mount Lofty Ranges region in South Australia. Methods We quantified the vulnerability of 171 plant species in a fragmented yet biologically important agro-ecological landscape, typical of many temperate zones globally. We specified exposure, using three climate change scenarios; sensitivity, as the adverse impact of climate change on species' spatial distribution; and adaptive capacity, as the ability of species to migrate calculated using dispersal kernels. Priority areas for reducing vulnerability were then identified by incorporating these various components into a single priority index. Results Climate change had a variable impact on species distributions. Those species whose range decreased or shifted geographically were attributed higher sensitivity than those species that increased geographic range or remained unchanged. The ability to adapt to range changes in response to shifting climates varies both spatially and between species. Areas of highest priority for reducing vulnerability were found at higher altitudes and lower latitudes with increasing severity of climate change. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the use of a single spatially explicit index that identifies areas in the landscape for targeting specific conservation and restoration actions to reduce species vulnerability to climate change. Our index can be transferred to other regions around the world in which climate change poses an increasing threat to native species.",,,,"Summers, David/G-3540-2011; Bryan, Brett Anthony/F-8949-2010; Crossman, Neville/G-5433-2010","Bryan, Brett Anthony/0000-0003-4834-5641; Crossman, Neville/0000-0002-8002-3450",,,,,41,44,2,85,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

The length of the observation time series used varies for each study. The impact of these differences has not been quantified explicitly. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the importance of the time series length relative to observation noise and data gaps. Different length synthetic time series are used to determine the parameter and C stocks of a simple ecosystem C model. Two commonly used DA schemes are tested: the sequential Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and a batch Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Longer time series improve both the parameter and C pool estimates of the EnKF, while adversely affecting those of the Metropolis algorithm. For both DA approaches, the length of the time series has more influence on the parameter and pool estimates than the level of random noise or amount of data. In this study, the EnKF provides more robust parameter and C pool estimates than the Metropolis algorithm. Optimized parameters and states are often used as the basis for forecasting future responses. Despite having better parameter and C pool estimates, EnKF forecasts estimates have much larger uncertainties than the Metropolis algorithm forecast estimates. Finally, we suggest that the structure of simple box models, as used in this study, introduces a large degree of equifinality into DA. Neither DA scheme correctly accounts for the equifinality, but our results suggest that it is particularly problematic for the batch Metropolis algorithm.",,,,"Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Ryan, Edmund/0000-0002-7003-9707",Natural Environment Research Council's (NERC) National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO); Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [earth010003],"We thank the Natural Environment Research Council's (NERC) National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) which funded this research.

A closer look at the arc of deforestation in southern Amazonia shows deforestation moving northward from ranching hotspots into surrounding frontiers as roads are opened. In the case of the Alta Floresta frontier, however, the road network has become dense enough that topographic features (land flatness and land away from river flooding plains) are now the significant risk factors of forest loss. Conversely, riparian corridors seem to be avoided by deforestation, as water and shade are vital for cattle weight gain or the corridors are waterlogged. Local interactions, expressed as spatial autocorrelation in multivariate models or neighbors in cellular automata forecasts, are also significant. In the short run, these local interactions produce a pattern of irreversible edge deforestation around pastures and fragmentation.

To evaluate changes in the Southern Appalachian mountain region, we reconstructed building and road locations in Macon County, North Carolina, since 1906 from historic maps, aerial photographs, county parcel records and emergency response program data. We used these data to analyze growth trends using spatio-temporal classification and quantile regression analysis. We also forecast future development patterns through 2030 using a multi-step model incorporating population growth projections, extrapolations of recent development density trends, and spatial logistic regression models. We characterize new development in the county as primarily rural from 1906 to 1960, exurban from 1960 to 1975 and increasingly suburban since 1975. While the rate of population growth and new building construction peaked in the 1980s. the total road length and rate of development in forested areas continued to increase from 1990 to 2009. We forecast that through 2030 approximately 75% of new buildings will be constructed at urban and suburban densities and that 67% of all new buildings will be constructed in forested areas. In addition to establishing the utility of using spatial analysis to draw together disparate data sources to understand urbanization over long time scales, this analysis identifies trends that have important implications for land-use planning, hydrology, forest management, and wildlife conservation.

Many studies of predatorprey interactions include the effect of spatial heterogeneity, but these are mostly based on species with restricted mobility or conducted in experimental settings. 2 Here, we aim to identify the patterns through which spatial heterogeneity affects predatorprey dynamics and to review the literature on the effect of spatial heterogeneity on predatorprey interactions in terrestrial mammalian systems, i.e. in freely moving species with high mobility, in non-experimental settings. We also review current methodologies that allow the study of the predation process within a spatial context. 3 When the functional response includes the effect of spatial heterogeneity, it usually takes the form of predator-dependent or ratio-dependent models and has wide applicability. 4 The analysis of the predation process through its different stages may further contribute towards identifying the spatial scale of interest and the specific spatial mechanism affecting predatorprey interactions. 5 Analyzing the predation process based on the functional response theory, but separating the stages of predation and applying a multiscale approach, is likely to increase our insight into how spatial heterogeneity affects predatorprey dynamics.

The stock increased dramatically in the late 1990s due to a succession of eight unusually strong year classes and dropped again equally dramatically after 2005 when the recruitment collapsed to former levels. The North Atlantic subpolar gyre has previously been shown to have a strong influence on the behaviour of this stock: synchronous changes in the gyre and recruitment suggest a causal linkage and the possibility of forecasting recruitment. A range of mechanisms are reviewed that may explain these observed changes, with two major candidate hypotheses being identified. One hypothesis suggests that the large mackerel (Scomber scombrus) stock in this region may feed on the pre-recruits of blue whiting, with the spatial overlap between blue whiting and mackerel being regulated by the subpolar gyre. Alternatively, variations in the physical environment may have given rise to changes in the amount, type and availability of food for larvae and juveniles, impacting their growth and survival and therefore recruitment.

Despite their microscopic size, phytoplankton support about half of the global primary production, drive essential biogeochemical cycles and represent the basis of the aquatic food web. At present, it is known that phytoplankton are important targets and, consequently, harbingers of climate change in aquatic systems. Therefore, investigating the capacity of phytoplankton to adapt to the predicted warming has become a relevant issue. However, considering the polyphyletic complexity of the phytoplankton community, different responses to increased temperature are expected. We experimentally tested the effects of warming on 12 species of phytoplankton isolated from a variety of environments by using a mechanistic approach able to assess evolutionary adaptation (the so-called ratchet technique). We found different degrees of tolerance to temperature rises and an interspecific capacity for genetic adaptation.

However, the degree of confidence that we can place on future climate-change projections depends on global climate-model performance and involves uncertainties that need to be assessed rigorously via climate-model evaluation. Performance assessments are important because the choice of climate model influences projections of species' range movement and extinction risk. A consensus view from the climate modeling community is that no single climate model is superior in its ability to forecast key climatic features. Despite this, the advantages of using multi-model ensemble-averaged climate forecasts to account for climate-model uncertainties have not been recognized by ecologists. Here we propose a method to use a range of skill and convergence metrics to rank commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) according to their skill in reproducing 20-year observed patterns of regional and global climates of interest, and to assess their consistency with other AOGCMs. By eliminating poorly performing models and averaging the remainder with equal weights, we show how downscaled annual multi-climate-model ensemble-averaged forecasts, which have a strong regional focus, can be generated. We demonstrate that: (1) model ranking (match of simulated to observed conditions) differs according to the skill metric used, as well as the climate variable and season considered; (2) although the multi-model averaged result tends to outperform single models at a global scale, at the continental scale at least some models can perform better than the multi-model average; and (3) forecasts for the Australian region, which are often based on a single AOGCM (CSIRO-3.0), show spatial patterns of change that differ noticeably from ensemble-average projections based on a subset of better-performing AOGCMs. Our suggested approach-novel in the ecology discipline-provides a straightforward, consistent, and defensible method for conservation practitioners and natural-resource managers to generate estimates of future climate change at a spatial resolution suitable for biodiversity impact studies.",,,,"Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Fordham, Damien A/E-9255-2013","Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Fordham, Damien A/0000-0003-2137-5592","U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; Office of Science, U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0989420]","MAGICC/SCENGEN 5.3 was developed primarily with funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but it rests on developments carried out over the past 20 years by T.

Farming practices aiming at conserving or increasing plant diversity are, however, usually less profitable than conventional ones. In this review, we aim to find reasons for this discrepancy, discuss ecosystem services of grassland phytodiversity that are useful for farmers, and ways of livestock management most beneficial for diversity. Under agricultural conditions, a clear effect of species richness on a site's primary or secondary production has not yet been demonstrated. Reasons could be that species numbers in permanent grassland are above the threshold of five species found effective in experimental plots or that the conditions are more in equilibrium with management than in weeded experimental plots. Other diversity effects on production stability, nutrient and water retention or product quality might convince farmers to increase diversity. However, these should be tested in agricultural situations, as most research has again been carried out in experimental plots. To enhance phytodiversity, grazing has been found superior over mowing, as selective grazing, treading and excreta deposition increase the heterogeneity of a sward and thus the niches available. Especially rotational grazing with intermediate intensity may be advantageous for phytodiversity. However, complex interactions between environmental conditions, sward composition, management and livestock behaviour make it difficult to forecast grazing effects. Thus, ecological and agricultural researchers should cooperate more, e.g. either in interdisciplinary projects or by hiring researchers from the respective other profession and thus diversifying research groups, in order to integrate agricultural management into biodiversity research and biodiversity measurements into agricultural research to advance our understanding of how to make conservation and enhancement of grassland phytodiversity both feasible and sustainable.",,,,"Cuchillo-Hilario, Mario/N-6579-2019; Wrage-Moennig, Nicole/AAC-7894-2020; Cuchillo Hilario, Mario/A-5882-2010","Cuchillo-Hilario, Mario/0000-0001-6985-3763; Wrage-Moennig, Nicole/0000-0002-3319-5655; ",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); DGRI-SEP,"During this research, Mario Cuchillo Hilario was supported by a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and DGRI-SEP grant.",,,38,49,1,124,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

The model quantifies the fitness loss for organisms failing to time behaviours optimally. We decompose the immediate change in fitness resulting from environmental changes into a component that is due to changes in the predictive power of the cue and a component that derives from the mismatch of the old response to the cue to the new environmental conditions.

Much of this research has focused on phenology - the timing of life-history events. Phenology has well-demonstrated links to climate, from genetic to landscape scales; yet our ability to explain and predict variation in phenology across species, habitats and time remains poor. Here, we outline how merging approaches from ecology, climate science and evolutionary biology can advance research on phenological responses to climate variability. Using insight into seasonal and interannual climate variability combined with niche theory and community phylogenetics, we develop a predictive approach for species' reponses to changing climate. Our approach predicts that species occupying higher latitudes or the early growing season should be most sensitive to climate and have the most phylogenetically conserved phenologies. We further predict that temperate species will respond to climate change by shifting in time, while tropical species will respond by shifting space, or by evolving. Although we focus here on plant phenology, our approach is broadly applicable to ecological research of plant responses to climate variability.",,,,"Bolmgren, Kjell/E-1459-2016; Kraft, Nathan J.

These factors include the attributes of the species, their abiotic environment, and the interactions and feedbacks between them. The relative importance of these factors has been difficult to quantify. We used nested subset theory and a novel permutation-based extension of gradient analysis to disentangle the direct and indirect pathways by which these factors affect the metacommunity structure of freshwater fishes inhabiting the streams tributary to the San Francisco Bay. Our analyses provide quantitative measures of how species and stream attributes may influence extinction vulnerability and invasion risk, highlight the need for considering the multiple interacting drivers of community change concurrently, and indicate that the ongoing disassembly and assembly of Bay Area freshwater fish communities are not fully symmetric processes. Fish communities are being taken apart and put back together in only partially analogous trajectories of extinction and invasion for which no single explanatory hypothesis is sufficient.

Here we show that the first major storm of the growing season strongly influences the population dynamics of three rare and endangered annual plant species in a coastal California (USA) ecosystem. In a field experiment we used moisture barriers and water addition to manipulate the timing and temperature associated with first major rains of the season. The three focal species showed two-to fivefold variation in per capita population growth rates between the different storm treatments, comparable to variation found in a prior experiment imposing eightfold differences in season-long precipitation. Variation in germination was a major demographic driver of how two of three species responded to the first rains. For one of these species, the timing of the storm was the most critical determinant of its germination, while the other showed enhanced germination with colder storm temperatures. The role of temperature was further supported by laboratory trials showing enhanced germination in cooler treatments. Our work suggests that, because of species-specific cues for demographic transitions such as germination, changes to discrete climate events may be as, if not more, important than changes to season-long variables.",,,,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0353608],"This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant 0353608.

Climate change has caused a phenological mismatch between the timing of reproduction and the local food peak in many bird species. Late breeding birds therefore experience reduced food availability during chick rearing and are thus predicted to have an increased energy expenditure. Observational studies, however, show mixed results, perhaps because they compare energy expenditure across rather than within individuals at different levels of food availability. 2. In a cross foster experiment, we measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) twice within individuals during chick feeding (when chicks were 6 and 14 days old) for 28 free-living female great tits (Parus major). To avoid confounding effects of chick age, these females reared on both occasions a standardized foster brood of eight 10-day-old chicks during the 24-h measuring period. For all birds, food availability declined between the two measurements. 3. We show that DEE during chick feeding increased within females when food availability decreased. Variation in DEE within females is partly explained by brood visit rates, food availability and temperature. 4. DEE during chick feeding could be affected by the investment in previous stages of the reproductive attempt. However, energy expenditure during chick feeding was not correlated to energy expenditure during egg laying, measured in these same females. 5. Understanding of energetic costs during all phases of the reproductive cycle is important to forecast the consequences of climate warming on timing of reproduction.",,,,"Visser, Marcel E/A-9151-2009; Meijer, Harro A J/A-5787-2012","Visser, Marcel E/0000-0002-1456-1939; ",NWO-VICINetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),"'Stichting Het Nationale Park De Hoge Veluwe' kindly allowed us to conduct our research on their property.

Water availability in such environments is highly pulsed, and discrete rainfall events interspersed with drought periods are important components of the annual water supply. Plant communities do not only respond to rainfall quantity, but also to variations in time, so that relatively small changes in rainfall frequency (i.e., pulsed inputs) may have strong effects on communities. Within the Mediterranean basin, climate change models forecast a decrease in mean annual precipitation and more extreme events (i.e., less rainy days and longer drought periods between events), along with seasonal changes. However, little is known on the consequences of these future precipitation changes on plant communities, especially in semi-arid environments. Here, we summarize the few experiments that have manipulated rainfall patterns in arid and semi-arid areas worldwide, and introduce the first results of a pioneer, long-term rainfall exclusion in the semi-arid southeast region of the Iberian Peninsula. The experiment is not only manipulating the amount of rainfall, but also its frequency and seasonal distribution in a grassland-shrubland in the Tabernas desert (Almeria, Spain). This work monitored the effect of precipitation changes on different ecosystem processes for five years, at the species and community level, concluding that this plant community (as other communities studied in the same area) exhibited great resilience to changes in rainfall availability, likely caused by plant adaptation to large intra- and inter-annual precipitation variability.

In this study a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important variables in the produced models. Moreover the comparison with a spectral response-based fuzzy classification, showed a higher accuracy in the Maxent outputs, demonstrating how the use of environmental variables, combined with spectral information in the classification of natural or semi-natural land cover classes, improves map accuracies. The modeling approach followed by this study, taking into account the uncertainty proper of the natural ecosystems and the use of environmental variables in land cover classification, can represent a useful approach to making more efficient and effective field inventories and to developing effective conservation policies.

Gravity models provide one of the most useful techniques available to model dispersal of nonindigenous invasive species (NIS) across heterogeneous landscapes, as these models are able to capture transport patterns of recreational boaters who are dominant vectors responsible for aquatic NIS dispersal. Despite the widespread use of gravity models in forecasting biological invasions, different classes of gravity models have not been evaluated regarding their comparative ability to capture recreational transport patterns and subsequent use in predicting NIS establishment. Here we evaluate model selection between unconstrained, total-flowconstrained, production-constrained and doubly-constrained stochastic gravity models to assess dispersal of the spiny waterflea Bythotrephes between Ontario lakes. Differences between the models relate to the amount of data required and constraints under which calculations of source/destination interactions are made. For each class of gravity model, we then estimated the probability of a lake having established Bythotrephes populations by modeling the relationship between empirical presence/absence data and inbound recreational traffic (i.e. propagule pressure) via boosted regression. The unconstrained gravity model provided the best fit to observed traffic patterns of recreational boaters. However, when output from the gravity models was used to predict Bythotrephes establishment, the doubly-constrained gravity model provided the strongest relationship between inbound recreational traffic and observed Bythotrephes presence/absence, followed by the production-constrained model. Our results indicate production-constrained gravity models offer an acceptable balance between modeling recreational boater traffic and their utility to estimate establishment probabilities.",,,,"macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020","Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662",Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network; OGSOntario Graduate Scholarship; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; DFO Invasive Species Research Chair,"We are grateful for discussions with M.

By analysing the 'climate paths' that range shifts might follow, and two key range-shift processes dispersal and population persistence - we show that short-term climatic and population characteristics have dramatic effects on range-shift forecasts. By employing this approach with 15 amphibian species in the western USA, we make unexpected predictions. First, inter-decadal variability in climate change can prevent range shifts by causing gaps in climate paths, even in the absence of geographic barriers. Second, the hitherto unappreciated trait of persistence during unfavourable climatic conditions is critical to species range shifts. Third, climatic fluctuations and low persistence could lead to endangerment even if the future potential range size is large. These considerations may render habitat corridors ineffectual for some species, and conservationists may need to consider managed relocation and augmentation of in situ populations.",,,,,"Early, Regan/0000-0003-4108-5904",Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BPD/63185/2009]; US DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE),"We acknowledge the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for making available the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset.

The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the response of these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent studies that have been conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality) or its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption/desorption and aggregate turnover. We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world.",,,,"Eliasson, Peter/K-3342-2014; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Davidson, Eric A/K-4984-2013; Conant, Richard/B-7586-2013; Wallenstein, Matthew/C-6441-2008; Giardina, Christian P/C-3120-2011; Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012; Ryan, Michael G/A-9805-2008; Frey, Serita D/Y-3397-2019; Wallenstein, Matthew D/S-3512-2016","Eliasson, Peter/0000-0002-6333-2518; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Davidson, Eric A/0000-0002-8525-8697; Conant, Richard/0000-0001-7315-2476; Wallenstein, Matthew/0000-0002-6219-1442; Giardina, Christian P/0000-0002-3431-5073; Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331; Ryan, Michael G/0000-0002-2500-6738; Frey, Serita D/0000-0002-9221-5919; Wallenstein, Matthew D/0000-0002-6219-1442; Lavallee, Jocelyn/0000-0002-3028-7087; Hopkins, Francesca/0000-0002-6110-7675; Birge, Hannah/0000-0001-6489-0098","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0842315]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [2008-35107-18655, 3454-CSU-DOE-4157]","This article reflects ideas initially discussed at a one-day workshop following the 'Soil Organic Matter Dynamics: Land Use, Management and Global Changes' meeting held at Colorado Springs, CO in July 2009.

Climatic constraints on plant distributions are well known, but predicting community composition through knowledge of trait-based environmental filtering remains an important empirical challenge. Here, we evaluate the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model of trait-based community assembly using forest communities occurring along a 12 degrees C gradient of mean annual temperature (MAT). We use independent cross-validation to evaluate model predictions from sites where trait constraints are predicted from environmental conditions. We also test whether orthogonal axes of trait variation can be used as predictors to improve model parsimony and exploreMaxEnt forecasts of species distributions in a warmer climate. 2. Environmental factors explained between 31% and 74% of the community-weighted mean trait values, indicating moderate-to-strong selection of traits along the environmental gradients. A model with 10 traits explained 54% of the variation in observed relative abundances, which approached the upper limit of 57% given the available environmental information. Three orthogonal axes accounted for 81% of the trait variation among species, and environmental factors explained between 47% and 67% of the variation in these axes. However, the axes only explained 18% of the variation in relative abundances, suggesting that minor axes of functional variation may be important or that models with many traits may achieve good predictive capacity through over-fitting. 3. Trait-environment relationships formed the basis for predicting vegetation change in a future scenario where MAT was increased by 2.5 degrees C. The results suggested that up to 78% of Pinus ponderosa forest in Arizona may transition to dominance by Juniperus monosperma, but this forecast likely overestimates the rates of species migration. 4. Synthesis. MaxEnt is a mathematical translation of trait-based environmental filtering of the species pool and performs moderately well in predicting forest community structure using empirical trait-environment relationships. MaxEnt required many traits to achieve good fits, and three orthogonal axes of trait variation performed poorly as predictors of community structure. To be useful predictors, traits must vary strongly among species and community-weighted mean traits must vary predictably along environmental gradients.",,,,"Laughlin, Daniel/G-8855-2012; Laliberte, Etienne/B-6855-2008; Laliberte, Etienne/Y-2543-2019","Laliberte, Etienne/0000-0002-3167-2622; ",Joint Venture Agreement [08-JV-11221633-233]; USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,This work was supported by a Joint Venture Agreement (#08-JV-11221633-233) with the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station.,,,57,58,1,110,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

During periods of environmental stress, such relationships may be exacerbated, and affect sex and age classes differently. We evaluated support for hypotheses about the relative roles of sex, age, and winter and summer climate on the probability of mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) survival in coastal Alaska. Specifically, we used known-fates analyses (Program MARK) to model the effects of age, sex, and climatic variation on survival using data collected from 279 radio-marked mountain goats (118 M, 161 F) in 9 separate study areas during 1977-2008. Models including age, sex, winter snowfall, and average daily summer temperature (during Jul-Aug) best explained variation in survival probability of mountain goats. Specifically, our findings revealed that old animals (9+ yr) have lower survival than younger animals. In addition, males tended to have lower survival than females, though differences only existed among prime-aged adult (5-8 yr) and old (9+ yr) age classes. Winter climate exerted the strongest effects on mountain goat survival; summer climate, however, was significant and principally influenced survival during the following winter via indirect effects. Furthermore, old animals were more sensitive to the effects of winter conditions than young or prime-aged animals. These findings detail how climate interacts with sex and age characteristics to affect mountain goat survival. Critically, we provide baseline survival rate statistics across various age, sex, and climate scenarios. These data will assist conservation and management of mountain goats by enabling detailed, model-based demographic forecasting of human and/or climate-based population impacts.

Here we present models of energy extraction, aircraft overflight and roadway noise as examples of spatially extensive sources and to present tools available for landscape scale investigations. We focus these efforts in US National Parks (Mesa Verde, Grand Teton and Glacier) to highlight that ecological noise pollution is not a threat restricted to developed areas and that many protected natural areas experience significant noise loads. As a heuristic tool for understanding past and future noise pollution we forecast community noise utilizing a spatially-explicit land-use change model that depicts the intensity of human development at sub-county resolution. For road noise, we transform effect distances from two studies into sound levels to begin a discussion of noise thresholds for wildlife.

These data can be used to create invasion risk models at landscape and regional scales. Further, regional maps of invasive plant abundance are useful for communicating the scope of the invasive species problem to the public and policymakers. Here, we present a set of regional distribution maps for 10 problematic invasive plants in the western United States, created from the expert knowledge of weed managers in over 300 counties. Invasive plant experts identified infestations on paper, and the results were digitized into a regional GIS. Over 40% of requests were returned, resulting in maps with good spatial coverage and distribution data suitable for assessing invasive plant abundance across the western United States. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) were the most abundant and widespread of the surveyed species; however, the high concentrations and broad spatial extents of other invasive plants, such as hounds tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), white top (Lepidium draba), and Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), highlight the ongoing problems invasive species pose for western ecosystems, rangelands, and croplands.

This zone is likely to be a sensitive indicator of the effects of climate change in coastal ecosystems, because of several key characteristics including steep environmental gradients, rapid temperature changes during tide transitions, fierce competition for limited space, and a community of mostly sessile organisms. Here we describe a modular modeling approach using modifications to a meteorological land surface model to determine body temperatures of the ecologically dominant rocky intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus, as a tool that can be used as a proxy for ecological performance. We validate model results against in situ measurements made with biomimetic body temperature sensors. Model predictions lie within the range of variability of biomimetic measurements, based on observations over a 4-year period at sites along 1700 km of the US west coast from southern California (34.5 degrees N) to northern Washington (48.4 degrees N). Our modular approach can be easily applied to many situations in the intertidal zone, including bare rock, mussel, barnacle, and algal beds, salt-marsh grasses, and sand- and mud-flats, by modifying the ""vegetation layer"" in a standard meteorological land surface model. Biophysical models such as these, which link ecological processes to changing climates through predictions of body temperature, are essential for understanding biogeographic patterns of physiological stress and mortality risk.

Multi-species models can incorporate data for rare or poorly-sampled species, but their application to forecasting climate change impacts on biodiversity has been limited. Here we compare forecasts of changes in patterns of ant biodiversity in North America derived from ensembles of single-species models to those from a multi-species modeling approach, Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM). We found that both single- and multi-species models forecasted large changes in ant community composition in relatively warm environments. GDM predicted higher turnover than SDMs and across a larger contiguous area, including the southern third of North America and notably Central America, where the proportion of ants with relatively small ranges is high and where data limitations are most likely to impede the application of SDMs. Differences between approaches were also influenced by assumptions regarding dispersal, with forecasts being more similar if no-dispersal was assumed. When full-dispersal was assumed, SDMs predicted higher turnover in southern Canada than did GDM. Taken together, our results suggest that 1) warm rather than cold regions potentially could experience the greatest changes in ant fauna under climate change and that 2) multi-species models may represent an important complement to SDMs, particularly in analyses involving large numbers of rare or poorly-sampled species. Comparisons of the ability of single- and multi-species models to predict observed changes in community composition are needed in order to draw definitive conclusions regarding their application to investigating climate change impacts on biodiversity.",,,,"Weiser, Michael/E-6215-2011; Fitzpatrick, Matt/F-7620-2010; Ferrier, Simon/C-1490-2009; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Weiser, Michael/0000-0001-9080-0834; Fitzpatrick, Matt/0000-0003-1911-8407; Ferrier, Simon/0000-0001-7884-2388; Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731; Dunn, Robert/0000-0002-6030-4837",UMCES; DOE-NICCRUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); DOE-PERUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-08ER64510]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX09AK22G]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0640015],"MCF was supported by funding from UMCES.

This manuscript describes a method that improves the prediction of cyanobacterial bloom transport with the use of a preoperational hydrodynamic model and high temporal resolution satellite imagery. Two scenarios were examined from separate cyanobacterial blooms in western Lake Erie, USA. The first scenario modeled bloom position and extent over the span of 13 days. A geographic center, or centroid, was calculated and assigned to the bloom from observed satellite imagery. The bloom centroid was projected forward in time, and the projected position was compared to the final observed bloom centroid. Image pixels flagged as cyanobacterial bloom were compared between the initial image and the final image, and this was assumed as persistence. The second bloom scenario was modeled for a period of 12 days, and the results were framed in an ecological context in an effort to gain further understanding of cyanobacterial bloom dynamics.

The objective of the study was to determine which gridded data are sufficient to capture observed patterns of thermal stress. Three coastal sites in western North America were included in this analysis: Boiler Bay, Oregon; Bodega Bay, California; and Pacific Grove, California. The gridded data with the highest spatial resolution, the 32-km North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and the 38-km Climate Forecasting System Reanalysis (CFSR), predicted daily maximum intertidal animal temperature most similarly to the local weather station data. Time step size was important for variables that change rapidly throughout the day, such as solar radiation. There were site-based differences in the ability of the model to predict daily maximum intertidal animal temperature, with the gridded data predictions being the closest to local weather station predictions in Boiler Bay, Oregon. In a review of gridded data used as part of ecological studies, there was broad use of the data across subject areas and ecosystems so the recent improvements in the spatial (from 2 degrees to 32 km) and temporal scales (from 6 hours to 1 hour) of gridded data will further add to the applicability within the ecological community particularly for mechanistic studies.",,,,"Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Smith, Allison/0000-0002-0761-0480","NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNG04GE43G, NNX07AF20G]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA04NOS4780264]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE1039513]","We thank Brian Helmuth, Venkat Lakshmi, Tammi Richardson, Sarah Woodin, and Sierra Jones for advice at various stages of this project, and two anonymous reviewers for greatly improving this manuscript.

This study demonstrates a combined Markov-Cellular Automata model to analyze temporal change and spatial distribution of land use stressed by natural and socioeconomic factors in Saga, Japan. Firstly, area change and spatial distribution of land use are calculated using GIS technology, and then the transition among different land use types is analyzed to obtain the transformation matrices during a period of 1976-2006. Meanwhile, an integration evaluation procedure with natural and socioeconomic data is used to generate the transition potential maps. Secondly, using the transition potential maps and transition matrices, a Markov-Cellular Automata model is established to simulate spatial distribution of land use in 2006. Finally, we use this Markov-Cellular Automata model to forecast the future land use changes during the period of 2015-2042. As a consequence, area change simulation predicts a continuing downward trend in agriculture land and forestland areas, as well as an upward trend in built-up areas; spatial distribution simulation indicates that built-up land will expand toward suburban regions, and land use of urban center is at the decline stage. Hence, if the current trends keep constant without holistic sustainable development measures, severe land use decline will ensue. The study is anticipated to help local authorities better understand and address a complex land use system, and develop the improved land use management strategies that can better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation.

Recent genetic research has demonstrated that this species is paraphyletic and part of a broader species complex; however, only one lineage (Myotis lucifugus lucifugus [M. l. lucifugus]) is present in eastern North America. I used molecular tools and niche modeling to validate this and investigate the role that historical biogeography has played in the phylogenetic and population genetic structure of this species to determine if the eastern subspecies represents an evolutionarily distinct population. To establish the genetic structure within M. l. lucifugus, I densely sampled maternity colonies in Minnesota and sequenced 182 individuals for a portion of cytochrome b. Phylogenetic reconstruction and a haplotype network were used to infer the relationships among mitochondrial haplotypes. Population growth statistics were calculated to determine if there was evidence of significant expansion, and an environmental niche model (ENM) was constructed based on conditions during the last glacial maximum (LGM) to illustrate potential glacial refugia. All individuals derived from a single mitochondrial lineage. Genetic evidence points to population growth starting approximately 18 kya. ENM results show that there was likely a single large southern refugium extending across the southeastern United States and possibly several isolated refugia in western North America. Myotis lucifugus lucifugus likely maintained both a large range and a large population during the peaks of the glacial cycles, and its population appears to have expanded following the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet. This imperiled lineage likely diverged in isolation from other members of the M. lucifugus/western long-eared Myotis during the Pleistocene.",,,,,,American Museum of Natural History; Bell Museum of Natural History; University of MN Graduate School,"Funded by a Theodore Roosevelt Fund grant from the American Museum of Natural History, a Dayton Natural History Fund grant from the Bell Museum of Natural History, and Alexander and Lydia Anderson and Doctoral Dissertation Fellowships through the University of MN Graduate School.",,,8,9,0,23,,,,2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

A critical challenge is to understand how changes in temperature will mediate ecological processes, such as disease. Several authors have suggested that warming will increase prevalence of diseases at high latitudes, yet long-term studies are lacking. We evaluated how parasite abundance and prevalence in an ecologically and economically important species (juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka) has changed in an Alaskan watershed that has experienced substantial climatic change over the past half-century. We hypothesized that the average increase in summer water temperature of 1.9A degrees C over the past 46 years in our study system would have resulted in a corresponding increase in fish metabolism, and thus potential consumption rates, that would increase infestation rates of the tapeworm Triaenophorus crassus. However, our comparison of data from 1948-1960 to 2008-2009 provided no evidence that the parasite load in juvenile sockeye salmon has significantly changed and that there is no significant relationship between summer temperature and average infestation rates. Climatic projections for southwest Alaska forecast a continuation of the current warming trend, which could potentially have effects on our studied parasite-host interaction, but thus far we found no change in infestation rates over the last 60 years.",,,,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Bristol Bay salmon processors; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Bristol Bay salmon processors, National Science Foundation for funding, the Wood River State Park staff for coordinating research.

Here we use time-series data from the small-mammal fossil records of two caves in the Great Basin of the American West to evaluate how contrasting and variable local paleoclimates have shaped small-mammal abundance dynamics over the last similar to 7500 years of climatic change. We then predict how species and communities will respond to future scenarios of increased warming and aridity coupled with continued spread of an invasive annual grass (Bromus tectorum). We find that most community-level responses to climatic change occur in the mammalian abundance structure at both sites; the dominance of the community by individuals from species with a southern geographic affinity increases with climatic warming. This suggests that responses occurred in situ rather than by the immigration of new taxa over this time interval. Despite predictability at the community-scale, species-level relationships between abundance and climate are variable and are not necessarily explained by a species' geographic affinity. Species present at both sites, however, exhibit remarkably similar responses to climate at each site, indicating that species autecology (specifically dietary functional group) is important in determining response to climatic warming. Regression-tree analyses show remarkable concordance between the two cave faunas and highlight the importance of a granivorous dietary strategy in this desert ecosystem. Under projections of increased temperature and decreased precipitation over the next 50 years, our results indicate that granivores should thrive as communities become more dominated by individuals with a southern geographic affinity. Granivores, however, are negatively impacted by the invasion of cheatgrass. The last century of anthropogenic impacts has thus placed granivores at a greater risk of extinction than predicted under climate-only scenarios.",,,,"Terry, Rebecca/L-7019-2017","Terry, Rebecca/0000-0002-9803-6292",NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"We thank D.

Our ability to predict the consequences of climate change on endangered species is limited by our scarce knowledge of the effects of climate variability on the population dynamics of most organisms and by the uncertainty of climate projections, which depend strongly on the region of the earth being considered. In this study, we analysed a long-term monitoring programme (1988-2009) of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) aimed at evaluating the consequences of the drastic changes in temperature and precipitation patterns predicted for the Mediterranean region on the demography of a long-lived species with low dispersal capability and already suffering a large number of threats. Capture-recapture modelling of a population in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain) allowed us to assess the effect of climate variability on the survival of tortoises. Winter rainfall was found to be the major driver of juvenile and immature survival, whereas that of adults remained high and constant across the study. Furthermore, local climate series obtained ad hoc from regional climate simulations, for this and 10 additional Mediterranean locations where tortoises occurred, provided us with reliable future climate forecasts, which were used to simulate the fate of these populations under three precipitation scenarios (mean, wet and dry) using stochastic population modelling. We show that a shift to a more arid climate would have negative consequences for population persistence, enhancing juvenile mortality and increasing quasiextinction risk because of a decrease in recruitment. These processes varied depending on the population and the climate scenario we considered, but our results suggest that unless other human-induced causes of mortality are suppressed (e. g. poaching, fire, habitat fragmentation), climate variability will increase extinction risk within most of the species' current range.",,,,"Tavecchia, Giacomo/N-3961-2014; Amengual, Arnau/L-2783-2014; Bertolero, Albert/I-6448-2019; Homar Santaner, Victor/K-2678-2014; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012","Tavecchia, Giacomo/0000-0001-5435-2691; Bertolero, Albert/0000-0002-6834-2600; Homar Santaner, Victor/0000-0003-1459-2003; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007; Fernandez-Chacon, Albert/0000-0003-4105-0090; Amengual, Arnau/0000-0002-6108-2850","European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]; Ebro Delta Natural Park (Generalitat de Catalunya)Generalitat de Catalunya; CIRIT [2000BEAI200029]; Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [EX2003-0769, CGL2009-08298]; MEDICANES [CGL2008-01271/CLI]; Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government [AP2008-04476]","We are especially grateful to the many people who participated in the field work over the years.

Here we report successful validation of a forest dynamics model Ecosystem Dynamics Simulator (EDS), adapted from the JABOWA-Il forest succession model. This model and many variants derived from it have successfully simulated growth dynamics of uneven-aged mixed forests under changing environment with a moderate amount of input data. But rarely are adequate time-series data available for quantitative model validation. This study tested the performance of EDS in projecting the tree density, tree diameter at breast height (dbh), tree height, basal area and aboveground biomass of uneven-aged, mixed species sclerophyll forests in St. Mary state forests of eastern Australia. The test data were collected between 1951 and 2005. Every tree was uniquely numbered, tagged and measured in consecutive re-measurements. Projected growth attributes were compared with those observed in an independent validation dataset. The model produced satisfactory projections of tree density (91.7%), dbh (92.3%), total tree height (82.8%), basal area (89.3%) and aboveground biomass (87.6%) compared to the observed attributes. These results suggest that the EDS model can provide reasonable capability in projecting growth dynamics of uneven-aged. mixed species sclerophyll forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Assimilating observed data into models is an effective way to reduce uncertainties in ecological forecasting. However, influences of measurement errors on parameter estimation and forecasted state changes have not been carefully examined. This study analyzed the parameter identifiability of a process-based ecosystem carbon cycle model, the sensitivity of parameter estimates and model forecasts to the magnitudes of measurement errors and the information contributions of the assimilated data to model forecasts with a data assimilation approach. Methods We applied a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to assimilate eight biometric data sets into the Terrestrial ECOsystem model. The data were the observations of foliage biomass, wood biomass, fine root biomass, microbial biomass, litter fall, litter, soil carbon and soil respiration, collected at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment facilities from 1996 to 2005. Three levels of measurement errors were assigned to these data sets by halving and doubling their original standard deviations. Important Findings Results showed that only less than half of the 30 parameters could be constrained, though the observations were extensive and the model was relatively simple. Higher measurement errors led to higher uncertainties in parameters estimates and forecasted carbon (C) pool sizes. The long-term predictions of the slow turnover pools were affected less by the measurement errors than those of fast turnover pools. Assimilated data contributed less information for the pools with long residence times in long-term forecasts. These results indicate the residence times of C pools played a key role in regulating propagation of errors from measurements to model forecasts in a data assimilation system. Improving the estimation of parameters of slow turnover C pools is the key to better forecast long-term ecosystem C dynamics.",,,,"Weng, Ensheng/E-4390-2012; Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Weng, Ensheng/0000-0002-1858-4847; Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733","Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0078325, DEB 0743778]","This research was financially supported by the Office of Science (BER), Department of Energy (DE-FG02-006ER64319) and through the Midwestern Regional Center of the National institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University, under Award Number DE-FC02-06ER64158 and by National Science Foundation (DEB 0078325 and DEB 0743778).

To address this concern, a large body of literature has developed in which these impacts are assessed. In this study, criteria for conducting reliable and useful assessments of impacts of future climate are suggested. The major decisions involve: clearly defining an emissions scenario; selecting a climate model; evaluating climate model skill and bias; quantifying General Circulation Model (GCM) between-model variability; selecting an ecosystem model and assessing uncertainty; properly considering transient versus equilibrium responses; including effects of CO2 on plant response; evaluating implications of simplifying assumptions; and considering animal linkage with vegetation. A sample of the literature was surveyed in light of these criteria. Many of the studies used climate simulations that were >10 years old and not representative of best current models. Future effects of elevated CO2 on plant drought resistance and productivity were generally included in growth model studies but not in niche (habitat suitability) studies, causing the latter to forecast greater future adverse impacts. Overly simplified spatial representation was frequent and caused the existence of refugia to be underestimated. Few studies compared multiple climate simulations and ecosystem models (including parametric uncertainty), leading to a false impression of precision and potentially arbitrary results due to high between-model variance. No study assessed climate model retrodictive skill or bias. Overall, most current studies fail to meet all of the proposed criteria.

The objective of this research was to elucidate the nature of distribution limits by studying the comparative structure, dynamics and environmental associations of breeding bird populations at their distribution margin. We hypothesized that climate is principally responsible for setting distribution limits, whereas biotic habitat features are more strongly associated with distribution patterns within the range. Location Southern California, USA. Methods During 2005-2007 we studied the distribution patterns of breeding birds in three study areas, each spanning a low-elevation (200-1800 m) desert scrub-to-chaparral gradient. We used logistic regression with hierarchical partitioning to assess the independent effects of environmental variables (e. g. climate versus habitat) on distributions. We tested for shifts in the relative importance of these environmental variables in determining distribution limits versus within-range patterns, and we also compared higher-and lower-elevation groups of species. Results Distribution patterns were highly variable among species, but were remarkably static over the three study areas and 3-year study period. Across species, habitat floristic variables performed relatively well at explaining distribution patterns. For higher-elevation species (chaparral birds), climate was relatively important in setting their lower distribution limits, and there was a shift to a greater importance of biotic habitat (mainly habitat structural variables) for determining within-range patterns. Relationships were more mixed for lower-elevation species (desert scrub birds), but with respect to distribution limits, biotic habitat variables tended to be more important relative to climate than we observed for chaparral birds. Main conclusions Along this warm, arid elevational gradient, higher-elevation chaparral birds are more limited by climate at their lower margin than are lower-elevation desert birds at their upper margin, suggesting that climate plays a strong role (relative to other values) in excluding non-desert birds from desert. However, given the strong differences among species, predictive distribution models will need to be individually tailored, and for most species biotic habitat variables were of greater importance than climate in determining limits. This research highlights the usefulness of studying environmental relationships at distribution margins and the importance of considering biotic relationships in forecasting distribution shifts under changing climates.",,,,,,California Department of Parks and Recreation; California Energy Commission; PRBO Conservation Science; Community Foundation Serving Riverside and San Bernardino Counties; University of California Natural Reserve System; Cooper Ornithological Society; Los Angeles Audubon Society,"Thanks to L.

This basic fact demonstrates the tight connection between ecology and evolution that defines the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. An effective synthesis of the interdependencies between ecology and evolution is grounded in six principles. The mechanics of evolution specifies the origin and rules governing traits and evolutionary strategies. Traits and evolutionary strategies achieve their selective value through their functional relationships with fitness. Function depends on the underlying structure of variation and the temporal, spatial and organizational scales of evolution. An understanding of how changes in traits and strategies occur requires conjoining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Adaptation merges these five pillars to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary change. I demonstrate the value of this world-view with reference to the theory and practice of habitat selection. The theory allows us to assess evolutionarily stable strategies and states of habitat selection, and to draw the adaptive landscapes for habitat-selecting species. The landscapes can then be used to forecast future evolution under a variety of climate change and other scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,61,64,1,125,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc. R. Soc.

Although the conservation management of reef associated species has been informed using species distribution models (SDM) and community based approaches, to date their use has been constrained to specific regions where the locality and spatial extent of reefs is well known. Much of the world's subtidal habitats remain either undiscovered or unmapped, including coasts of intense human use. Consequently, to facilitate a stronger understanding of species-environmental relationships there is an urgent need for a cost and time effective standard method to map reefs at fine spatial resolutions across broad geographical extents. We used bathymetric data (similar to 250 m resolution) to calculate the local slope and curvature of the seabed. We then constructed artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the probability of reef occurrence within grid cells as a function of bathymetric and slope variables. Testing over an independent data set not used in training showed that ANNs were able to accurately predict the location of reefs for 86% of all grid cells (Kappa = 0.63) without over fitting. The ANN with greatest support, combining bathymetric values of the target grid cell with the slope of adjacent grid cells, was used to map inshore reef locations around the Southern Australian coastline (similar to 250 m resolution). Broadly, our results show that reefs are identifiable from coarse-scale bathymetry data of the seabed. We anticipate that our research technique will strengthen systematic conservation planning tools in many regions of the world, by enabling the identification of rocky substratum and mapping in localities that remain poorly surveyed due to logistics or monetary constraints.

General, empirical allometric relationships are used to parameterize both the optimal prey size and size selectivity for each grazer class, as is rarely done. This inclusion of complex predator-prey linkages and realistic prey preferences yields a system with an emergent pattern of phytoplankton diversity consistent with global ocean observations, i.e., a parabolic relationship between diversity (as measured by the Shannon evenness) and biomass. It also yields significant long-term time evolution, which places limits on the extent to which the community response to nutrient forcing can be predicted from forcing in a pragmatic sense. When a simple annual cycle in nutrient supply is repeated exactly for many years, transient fluctuations up to a factor of two in spring bloom magnitude persist for 10-20 years before a stable seasonal biomass cycle is achieved. When the amplitude of the nutrient-supply annual cycle is given a random interannual modulation, these long-lived transients add significant noise to a 100-year correlation between annual-mean nutrient supply and annual-mean biomass. This noise is 20% of total interannual variance in the model base case, and ranges from 0% to 40% depending on the grazer size selectivity. In general, unpredictability on the bloom timescale is damped when food-web complexity is increased by making grazers less selective, while unpredictability on the interannual scale shows the opposite pattern, increasing with increasing food-web complexity up to a high threshhold, past which community structure and biomass time evolution both suddenly simplify. These results suggests a new strategy for ensemble ecosystem forecasting and uncertainty estimation, analogous to methods common in circulation and climate modeling, in which internal variability (predator-prey interactions in the biological case; eddies and climate-system oscillations in the physical case) are resolved and quantified, rather than suppressed.

This study represents a first step towards such a theory. We present theoretical predictions of I between two populations with respect to a single haploid biallelic locus. Dynamical and steady-state forecasts of I are derived from a Wright-Fisher model with symmetrical mutation between alleles and symmetrical dispersal between populations.

Here we assessed climate change threat to the European otter, a flagship species for freshwater ecosystems, considering how current conservation areas will perform in preserving the species in a climatically changed future. We used an ensemble forecasting approach considering six modelling techniques applied to eleven subsets of otter occurrences across Europe. We performed a pseudo-independent and an internal evaluation of predictions. Future projections of species distribution were made considering the A2 and B2 scenarios for 2080 across three climate models: CCCMA-CGCM2, CSIRO-MK2 and HCCPR HAD-CM3. The current and the predicted otter distributions were used to identify priority areas for the conservation of the species, and overlapped to existing network of protected areas. Our projections show that climate change may profoundly reshuffle the otter's potential distribution in Europe, with important differences between the two scenarios we considered. Overall, the priority areas for conservation of the otter in Europe appear to be unevenly covered by the existing network of protected areas, with the current conservation efforts being insufficient in most cases. For a better conservation, the existing protected areas should be integrated within a more general conservation and management strategy incorporating climate change projections. Due to the important role that the otter plays for freshwater habitats, our study further highlights the potential sensitivity of freshwater habitats in Europe to climate change.

This assumption, used in many land-use change forecasts, was never properly tested, mainly because the relatively short period of full-coverage land-use inventories did not allow a systematic analysis of the phenomena. With the recent release of CORINE 2006 this has changed. In this article, we explore the typical locations of abandonment and expansion of arable land in Europe during the period 1990-2006 by means of logistic regressions. More specifically, we test whether or not locations of abandonment and expansion can be inferred from the location characteristics of arable land in 1990. If the above assumption holds, this should be the case. We demonstrate that although arable expansion indeed happens in locations that resemble the bulk of arable land in 1990 (the presumably favorable locations), arable abandonment does not necessarily happen in locations that resemble the bulk of uncultivated land (that is, the presumably unfavorable locations). In other words, the assumption does not hold. Particularly, areas close to the road network were found to be associated with both high abandonment rates and high expansion rates, which suggest that abandonment is not limited to areas that are marginal in terms of agricultural production.",,,,"Hatna, Erez/D-9665-2015",,EUEuropean Union (EU),The study presented in this article was carried out as part of the EU funded Sixth Framework projects FARO (Foresight Analysis of Rural areas Of Europe) and Nitro-Europe (The nitrogen cycle and its influence on the European greenhouse gas balance).,,,73,81,3,42,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,AUG,2011,14,5,,,,,720,731,,10.1007/s10021-011-9441-y,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000292813800004,,,,,

Models were tested by linear regression against four response variables based on average Ellenberg indicator values for temperature (cover weighted/unweighted, with/without bryophytes), which were computed for 2280 georeferenced releves from the vegetation database BERGWALD. We optimized (b) by empirically searching for thermally most favourable slope aspect and inclination. Results: Closest model fit was achieved for unweighted temperature values based on vascular plants without bryophytes. Model fit (adj. R(2)) increased from using temperature alone to temperature-radiation, to temperature-aspect-inclination as predictors. The best spatially explicit model for predicting temperature values (adj. R(2) = 0.57) was based on the variable combination mean temperature in the growing season (May to September), slope aspect (optimal aspect 195 degrees) and inclination (optimal slope 30 degrees). Conclusion: Combining mean temperatures and relief variables in GIS allows creation of predictive maps of mountain forest response to thermal climate. Applied to climate change scenarios, our model can forecast potential vegetation distribution in the future. The superiority of simple empirical relief factors over a widely used model of potential radiation casts doubt on the meaningfulness of the latter for vegetation studies.",,,,,"Ewald, Jorg/0000-0002-2758-9324",European Fund for Regional Development (EFRE)European Union (EU); Bavarian Forest Administration; Bavaria State Forest Enterprise (BaySF),"The research presented here forms part of the project 'Forest Information System for the Northern Alps' (http://www.winalp.info), which is funded by the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRE) within the 'IN-TERREG Bayern - Osterreich 2007-2013' programme, the Bavarian Forest Administration and the Bavaria State Forest Enterprise (BaySF).

Regulation of rivers for human demands has led to extensive forest dieback on many floodplains. If these important ecosystems are to be maintained under future drier climates, we need accurate tools for predicting forest dieback. In the absence of spatially explicit flooding histories for many floodplains, changes in groundwater conditions may be a good indicator of water availability and, therefore, an important environmental indicator. 2. Eucalyptus camaldulensis forests of Australia are an acute example of forest dieback, with 70% of the Victorian Murray River floodplain dying back. We quantified the relationship between forest dieback and ground water across this extensive floodplain (c. 100 000 ha of forest over 1500 km of river length). 3. A combination of extensive ground surveys, remotely sensed data and modelling methods was used to predict forest dieback at the time of the survey and in the past. This approach provides a valuable tool for accurately monitoring forest condition over large spatial scales. Forest dieback was estimated to have increased from 45 to 70% of the floodplain between 1990 and 2006. 4. Accurate groundwater data (depth and salinity) over a 20-year period were obtained for 289 bores and summarised using nonlinear regression. Groundwater depth and salinity were strong predictors of stand condition. This suggests that changes in groundwater conditions could be used to signal areas vulnerable to forest dieback and prioritise the limited water available for managed flooding. 5. In the upper Murray, where ground water is predominantly fresh (< 15 mS cm(-2)), dieback increased with increasing groundwater depth. In contrast, the condition of stands in the lower Murray improved with increases in groundwater depth due its high salinity (> 30 mS cm(-2)). These regional differences in response of the same tree species to groundwater conditions show that our understanding of the drivers of forest dieback is best achieved at spatial and temporal scales representative of the problem.",,,,"Thomson, Jim/W-2950-2019; Cunningham, Shaun/I-1116-2012; Cunningham, Shaun/J-7669-2015","Cunningham, Shaun/0000-0002-1447-312X; Cunningham, Shaun/0000-0002-1447-312X; Baker, Patrick/0000-0002-6560-7124","ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [LP0560518]; Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and four Victorian Catchment Management Authorities (Mallee CMA, North Central CMA, Goulburn-Broken CMA and North-East CMA)","This research was funded by an ARC linkage grant (LP0560518, which was partially supported by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and four Victorian Catchment Management Authorities (Mallee CMA, North Central CMA, Goulburn-Broken CMA and North-East CMA).

Biofuel production has the potential of reducing CO2 emissions while decreasing global dependence on fossil fuels. However, concerns have been raised on the invasiveness of biofuel feedstocks. Estimating invasion potential remains a challenge because of inconsistencies and inherent limitations of using first-tier qualitative weed risk assessment (WRA) protocols singularly. 2. We evaluated the usefulness of second-tier quantitative WRA methods using a recently introduced oilseed crop, Camelina sativa, as a model species. First, we subjected C. sativa to the qualitative Australian WRA and found that it should not be allowed entry. We then used demographic models fit with field-estimated parameters as a second-tier approach to quantitatively evaluate its invasion potential. Data on disturbance (two herbicides, mechanical, none) and seeding season (autumn, spring) relative to C. sativa demography were obtained over 2 years in two rangeland ecosystems in Montana, USA. Population growth (lambda) was forecast by developing population dynamics models using field data. 3. Emergence rates were greatest when C. sativa was spring-seeded; all survivors to maturity occurred only in mechanically disturbed plots. Population growth rate never exceeded 0.03, and the maximum time to extinction was 6 years. Perturbation analyses indicated that consistent propagule pressure and biologically improbable rates of seed survival are necessary to sustain C. sativa populations, indicating that the risk of invasion by this species in the studied ecosystems is low. 4. Synthesis and applications. Although more site-years of demographic data would strengthen our conclusions about the invasion potential of C. sativa, we contend that the methods developed provide a useful contribution to WRA. If applied to proposed plant biofuel species, our second-tier quantitative refinements will elucidate important population dynamics often overlooked by qualitative WRAs and, in turn, may reduce the frequency of invasions or rejection of potentially useful species.",,,,,,,,,,11,15,0,33,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The northwestern part of the northern Adriatic exhibits eutrophic to mesotrophic characteristics with recurrent algal blooms. To contribute to the understanding of eutrophication trends in the northern Adriatic a machine learning tool for induction of models in form of regression trees and in form of set of rules was applied on a data set comprising physical, chemical and biological parameters measured at six stations on the profile from the Po River delta (Italy) to the city of Rovinj on the western coast of Istria (Croatia). Two types of models were successfully elaborated, i.e. (1) the descriptive model to explain the dynamics of phytoplankton concentration in the northern Adriatic as a result of independent environmental variables, and (2) the predictive model to predict the phytoplankton concentration. The descriptive model for phytoplankton dynamics integrates and presents in a user-friendly way the knowledge collected through measurements over a period of 35 years.

Unfortunately, the area is now experiencing degradation due to resource overuse. In an attempt to forecast grassland production and to sustain the ecosystem, we built a time-dependent simulation model of the ecosystem based on long-range weather forecasts (several weeks to several months). The model incorporated five state variables including aboveand belowground biomass, the amount of standing dead plant material, livestock (sheep) weight, and the amount of excrement per unit ground area. Within the model, solar light energy is fixed by grassland vegetation and flows through the other variables via a variety of organism-environment interactions. The model was written using a set of simultaneous differential equations and was numerically analyzed. The values of the time-dependent parameters controlling energy flow were determined based on data accumulated in experiments and field surveys executed at a grassland experimental station located in Xilingol, as well as by reference to related literature. We used daily meteorological data including air temperature and rainfall recorded at the Xilinhot Meteorological Observatory. Simulated results for several stocking densities coincided well with the data of aboveground plant biomass observed at the experimental station in 1990, 1993, and 1997. We obtained reasonable simulation results for five stocking densities, three air temperature patterns, and five rainfall patterns. When a month-long drought, which sometimes occurs in this area, was forecast by a local weather station, a decrease in grassland production was forecast by the model. Such forecasts will assist in the management of livestock, forage preservation, and grassland conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of the current ecological condition of habitat linkages can be used to determine appropriate management activities, including restoration. Forecasting the future ecological condition of identified linkages under multiple human-use scenarios can identify future patterns of vulnerability and degradation, and thus aid in prioritization of conservation and restoration actions. We forecast the ecological condition of a modeled conservation network of cores and habitat linkages in the San Joaquin Valley, California, a highly developed agricultural area. We assessed current and projected future impacts from modeled urban growth representing seven regional urban growth policy scenarios to determine conservation and restoration priorities. We characterized current ecological condition of the linkages using a clustering algorithm that compared vegetation type, length, and major road and canal crossings. The modeled urban growth forecasts were overlaid on the ecological network to identify expected impacts. A threat index was calculated for individual network components and for component clusters, and revealed significant impact differences between the various urban growth scenarios. The linkages most threatened by urban conversion were those that are currently the most ecologically degraded, suggesting that a significant future conservation issue in this working landscape will be the loss of restoration opportunities rather than loss of intact wildlife linkages.

In this study, we examine how effectively forecasts of a forest carbon cycle can be improved by assimilating observations with the EnKF. We used the EnKF to assimilate into the terrestrial ecosystem (TECO) model eight data sets collected at the Duke Forest between 1996 and 2004 (foliage biomass, fine root biomass, woody biomass, litterfall, microbial biomass, forest floor carbon, soil carbon, and soil respiration). We then used the trained model to forecast changes in carbon pools from 2004 to 2012. Our daily analysis of parameters indicated that all the exit rates were well constrained by the EnKF, with the exception of the exit rates controlling the loss of metabolic litter and passive soil organic matter. The poor constraint of these two parameters resulted from the low sensitivity of TECO predictions to their values and the poor correlation between these parameters and the observed variables. Using the estimated parameters, the model predictions and observations were in agreement. Model forecasts indicate 15 380-15 660 g C/m(2) stored in Duke Forest by 2012 (a 27% increase since 2004). Parameter uncertainties decreased as data were sequentially assimilated into the model using the EnKF. Uncertainties in forecast carbon sinks increased over time for the long-term carbon pools (woody biomass, structure litter, slow and passive SOM) but remained constant over time for the short-term carbon pools (foliage, fine root, metabolic litter, and microbial carbon). Overall, EnKF can effectively assimilate multiple data sets into an ecosystem model to constrain parameters, forecast dynamics of state variables, and evaluate uncertainty.",,,,"Weng, Ensheng/E-4390-2012","Weng, Ensheng/0000-0002-1858-4847","Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0743778]","We greatly appreciate two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Recently, data assimilation has been applied to improve these models for ecological forecasting. It is not clear what the relative information contributions of model (structure and parameters) vs. data are to constraints of short-and long-term forecasting. In this study, we assimilated eight sets of 10-year data (foliage, woody, and fine root biomass, litter fall, forest floor carbon [C], microbial C, soil C, and soil respiration) collected from Duke Forest into a Terrestrial Ecosystem model (TECO). The relative information contribution was measured by Shannon information index calculated from probability density functions (PDFs) of carbon pool sizes. The null knowledge without a model or data was defined by the uniform PDF within a prior range. The relative model contribution was information content in the PDF of modeled carbon pools minus that in the uniform PDF, while the relative data contribution was the information content in the PDF of modeled carbon pools after data was assimilated minus that before data assimilation. Our results showed that the information contribution of the model to constrain carbon dynamics increased with time whereas the data contribution declined. The eight data sets contributed more than the model to constrain C dynamics in foliage and fine root pools over the 100-year forecasts. The model, however, contributed more than the data sets to constrain the litter, fast soil organic matter (SOM), and passive SOM pools. For the two major C pools, woody biomass and slow SOM, the model contributed less information in the first few decades and then more in the following decades than the data.

The ability of seeds to survive periods of drying and wetting that do not lead to seed production will determine the potential species pool for future plant communities of temporary wetlands. I investigated characteristics of the seed banks in sediment from Australian temporary wetlands that might contribute to the ability of aquatic plants to re-establish after extended drought. 2. Experimental investigation into germination from sediment from six sites in five Australian temporary wetlands, with various water regimes, examined two sources of seed bank depletion: (i) length of time dry (longevity up to 12 years) and (ii) successive annual wetting and germination events (up to seven) with intervening periods dry (leaving a residual seed bank), both without any opportunity for replenishment of the seed bank. 3. These wetlands had species-rich, long-lived seed banks that were not exhausted by successive germination events. After three years of dry storage, 90% of the original seed bank species germinated, after six years 75% and after 12 years 20%. After seven successive wetting and drying events without seed bank replenishment, 48% of the original species still germinated. The mean survival time dry for seed bank species, 7.4 years, was longer than the duration of recent droughts. 4. Seed bank composition varied among wetlands and over time; most species did not occur in all wetlands and many occurred in one wetland only. The germination patterns of different species, although differing in detail, tended to be consistent in that all species could survive long dry periods and several wetting and drying events. However, experimental drought significantly diminished species richness and abundance, indicating limits to seed bank persistence. 5. Data from such long-term studies of seed bank persistence should allow prediction of the species richness and composition of the germinating communities in a wetland whose water regime is intentionally or unintentionally altered.

These forces include (1) dramatically increased volumes of data from observational and experimental networks, (2) increases in computational power, (3) advances in ecological models and related statistical and optimization methodologies, and most importantly, (4) societal needs to develop better strategies for natural resource management in a world of ongoing global change. Traditionally, ecological forecasting has been based on process-oriented models, informed by data in largely ad hoc ways. Although most ecological models incorporate some representation of mechanistic processes, today's models are generally not adequate to quantify real-world dynamics and provide reliable forecasts with accompanying estimates of uncertainty. A key tool to improve ecological forecasting and estimates of uncertainty is data assimilation (DA), which uses data to inform initial conditions and model parameters, thereby constraining a model during simulation to yield results that approximate reality as closely as possible. This paper discusses the meaning and history of DA in ecological research and highlights its role in refining inference and generating forecasts. DA can advance ecological forecasting by (1) improving estimates of model parameters and state variables, (2) facilitating selection of alternative model structures, and (3) quantifying uncertainties arising from observations, models, and their interactions. However, DA may not improve forecasts when ecological processes are not well understood or never observed. Overall, we suggest that DA is a key technique for converting raw data into ecologically meaningful products, which is especially important in this era of dramatically increased availability of data from observational and experimental networks.",,,,,"LaDeau, Shannon/0000-0003-4825-5435","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, EF 0938795]; Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]","This study was financially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, EF 0938795; by the Office of Science (BER), Department of Energy, Grants No. DE-FG02-006ER64319; and through the Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University, under Award Number DE-FC02-06ER64158.",,,127,128,0,89,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding.

Model parameters may be difficult or impractical to measure, while driver fields are rarely complete, with data gaps due to sensor failure and sparse observational networks. Parameters are generally derived through some optimization method, while driver fields may be interpolated from available data sources. For this study, we used data from a young ponderosa pine stand at Metolius, Central Oregon, and a simple daily model of coupled carbon and water fluxes (DALEC). An ensemble of acceptable parameterizations was generated using an ensemble Kalman filter and eddy covariance measurements of net C exchange. Geostatistical simulations generated an ensemble of meteorological driving variables for the site, consistent with the spatiotemporal autocorrelations inherent in the observational data from 13 local weather stations. Simulated meteorological data were propagated through the model to derive the uncertainty on the CO2 flux resultant from driver uncertainty typical of spatially extensive modeling studies. Furthermore, the model uncertainty was partitioned between temperature and precipitation. With at least one meteorological station within 25 km of the study site, driver uncertainty was relatively small (similar to 10% of the total net flux), while parameterization uncertainty was larger, similar to 50% of the total net flux. The largest source of driver uncertainty was due to temperature (8% of the total flux). The combined effect of parameter and driver uncertainty was 57% of the total net flux. However, when the nearest meteorological station was >100 km from the study site, uncertainty in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) predictions introduced by meteorological drivers increased by 88%. Precipitation estimates were a larger source of bias in NEE estimates than were temperature estimates, although the biases partly compensated for each other. The time scales on which precipitation errors occurred in the simulations were shorter than the temporal scales over which drought developed in the model, so drought events were reasonably simulated. The approach outlined here provides a means to assess the uncertainty and bias introduced by meteorological drivers in regional-scale ecological forecasting.",,,,"Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016; Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010","Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203",NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-06ER64318],"This research was supported by an NERC studentship for L.

Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management.

This study focuses on local variations in snow and ice conditions, effects of the first durable snow, and long term changes in snow and ice conditions as pre-requisites for understanding potential future changes. Firstly, we characterised snow types and profiles based on Sami categories and measured their density and hardness. Regression analysis showed that density can explain much of the variation in hardness, while snow depth was not significantly correlated with hardness. Secondly, we found that whether it is dry/cold or warm/wet around the fall of the first durable snow is, according to Sami reindeer herders, crucial information for forecasting winter grazing conditions, but this has had limited focus within science. Thirdly, elderly herders' observations of changes in snow and ice conditions by 'reading nature' can aid reinterpretation of meteorological data by introducing researchers to alternative perspectives. In conclusion we found remarkable agreement between scientific measurements and Sami terminology.

It is difficult to forecast how climate change will influence community function or the probability of invasion as it alters multiple marine environmental parameters including rising water temperature, lower salinity and pH. In the present study, we correlate changes in environmental parameters to shifts in species composition in a subtidal community in Newcastle, NH through comparison of two, 3-year periods separated by 23 years (1979-1981 and 2003-2005). We observed concurrent shifts in climate related factors and in groups of organisms that dominate the marine community when comparing 1979-1981 to 2003-2005. The 1979-1981 community was dominated by perennial species (mussels and barnacles). In contrast, the 2003-2005 community was dominated by annual native and invasive tunicates (sea-squirts). We also observed a shift in the environmental factors that characterized both communities. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate characterized the 1979-1981 community while sea surface temperature, pH, and chlorophyll a characterized the 2003-2005 community. Elongated warmer water temperatures, through the fall and early winter months of the 2000s, extended the growing season of native organisms and facilitated local dominance of invasive species. Additionally, beta-diversity was greater between 2003-2005 than 1979-1981 and driven by larger numbers of annual species whose life-history characteristics (e.g., timing and magnitude of recruitment, growth and mortality) are driven by environmental parameters, particularly temperature.",,,,,,"University of New Hampshire Graduate School; Marine Program, a Dissertation Fellowship; New Hampshire Estuaries Project","Field assistance was provided by L.

The spatial complexities underlying our relationship to climate and the geographical disparities in human demographic change have, however, precluded the development of global indices of the predicted regional impacts of climate change on humans. Humans will be most negatively affected by climate change in regions where populations are strongly dependent on climate and favourable climatic conditions decline. Here we use the relationship between the distribution of human population density and climate as a basis to develop the first global index of predicted impacts of climate change on human populations. Location Global. Methods We use spatially explicit models of the present relationship between human population density and climate along with forecasted climate change to predict climate vulnerabilities over the coming decades. We then globally represent regional disparities in human population dynamics estimated with our ecological niche model and with a demographic forecast and contrast these disparities with CO2 emissions data to quantitatively evaluate the notion of moral hazard in climate change policies. Results Strongly negative impacts of climate change are predicted in Central America, central South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and much of Africa. Importantly, the regions of greatest vulnerability are generally distant from the high-latitude regions where the magnitude of climate change will be greatest. Furthermore, populations contributing the most to greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis are unlikely to experience the worst impacts of climate change, satisfying the conditions for a moral hazard in climate change policies. Main conclusions Regionalized analysis of relationships between distribution of human population density and climate provides a novel framework for developing global indices of human vulnerability to climate change. The predicted consequences of climate change on human populations are correlated with the factors causing climate change at the regional level, providing quantitative support for many qualitative statements found in international climate change assessments.",,,,"McGill, Brian/A-3476-2008; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","McGill, Brian/0000-0002-0850-1913; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,We are grateful to Elena Bennett for hardware support and Guillaume Larocque for analytical advice.

Rapid environmental changes and pressing human needs to forecast the consequences of environmental change are increasingly driving ecology to become a predictive science. The need for effective prediction requires both the development of new tools and the refocusing of existing tools that may have previously been used primarily for purposes other than prediction. One such tool that historically has been more descriptive in nature is ecomorphology (the study of relationships between ecological roles and morphological adaptations of species and individuals). 2. Here, we examine relationships between diet and gut morphology for 15 species of brachyuran crabs, a group of pervasive and highly successful consumers for which trophic predictions would be highly valuable. 3. We show that patterns in crab stomach volume closely match some predictions of metabolic theory and demonstrate that individual diet differences and associated morphological variation reflect, at least in some instances, individual choice or diet specialization. 4. We then present examples of how stomach volume can be used to predict both the per cent herbivory of brachyuran crabs and the relative consumption rates of individual crabs.",,,,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014",,University of South Carolina,This research was supported by the University of South Carolina.

The system, called car2go, allows users to take and leave vehicles at any point within the city limits. Thus opposed to traditional car-sharing, there are no fixed stations and in particular one-way trips of any length are possible without a booking requirement. Since this is the first free-floating system in operation, there is as yet no associated empirical research. Based on primary data from a survey, a model was developed to forecast the environmental impact of car2go. The prognosis considers the period of five years after the launch of car2go in 2009 and indicates a CO2-reduction per average car2go-user. In addition, more than a quarter of the survey respondents stated that they may forgo a car purchase if car2go was offered permanently. By reaching a greater share of citizens than traditional systems, the results indicate that free-floating car-sharing systems could contribute to reducing private vehicle ownership in cities.

Dynamic spread modelling is a potentially valuable tool to assist regional and central government authorities to monitor and control invasive species. To date a lack of suitable data has meant that most broad scale dispersal models have not been validated with independent datasets, and so their predictive ability and reliability has remained unscrutinised. A dynamic, stochastic dispersal model of the widely invasive plant Buddleja davidii was calibrated on European spread data and then used to project the temporal progression of B. davidii's distribution in New Zealand, starting from several different historical distributions. To assess the model's performance, we constructed an occupancy map based on the average number of simulation realisations that have a population present. The application of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to occupancy maps is introduced, but with specificity substituted by the proportion of available area used in a realisation. A derivative measure, the partial area under these curves when assessed through time (pAUC), is introduced and used to assess overall performance of the spread model. The model was able to attain a high level of model sensitivity, encompassing all of the known locations within the occupancy envelope. However, attempting to simulate the spread of this invasive species beyond a decade had very low model specificity. This is due to several factors, including the exponential process of spread (the further a population spreads the more sites exist from which it can spread stochastically), and the Markovian chain property of the stochastic system whereby differences between realisations compound through time. These features are seen in many reports of spread models, without being explicitly acknowledged. Our measure of pAUC through time allows a model's temporal performance and its specificity to be simultaneously assessed. While the rapid deterioration in model performance limits the utility of this type of modelling for forecasting long-term broad-scale strategic management of biological invasions, it does not necessarily limit its attractiveness for informing smaller scale and shorter term invasion management activities such as surveillance, containment and local eradication.

We derive general results that reveal how dynamic models that simulate growth as an increase in a linear measure of size (e.g., diameter, length, height) result in biased estimates of future mean biomass when uncertainty in growth is misrepresented. Our case study shows how models of tree growth that predict the same mean diameter increment, but with alternative representations of growth uncertainty, result in almost a threefold difference in the projections of future mean tree biomass after a 20-yr simulation. These results have important implications concerning our ability to accurately predict future biomass and all the related environmental services (e.g., forest carbon content, timber and fishery yields). If the objective is to predict future biomass, we strongly recommend that: (1) ecological modelers should choose a growth model based on a variable more linearly related to biomass (e.g., tree basal area instead of tree diameter for forest models); (2) if field measurements preclude the use of variables other than the linear measure of size, both the mean and other statistical moments (e.g., covariances) should be carefully modeled; (3) careful assessment be done on models that aggregate similar individuals (i.e., cohort models) to see if neglecting autocorrelated growth from individuals leads to biased estimates of future mean biomass.",,,,"Valle, Denis/B-7650-2012","Valle, Denis/0000-0002-9830-8876",,,,,2,4,0,20,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In this review, we highlight the frontiers in climate change-infectious disease research by reviewing knowledge gaps that make this controversy difficult to resolve. We suggest that forecasts of climate-change impacts on disease can be improved by more interdisciplinary collaborations, better linking of data and models, addressing confounding variables and context dependencies, and applying metabolic theory to host-parasite systems with consideration of community-level interactions and functional traits. Finally, although we emphasize host-parasite interactions, we also highlight the applicability of these points to climate-change effects on species interactions in general.",,,,"Moreira, Marcio/Q-2547-2015","Moreira, Marcio/0000-0002-4932-4968","Ecological Society of America; US Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R833835, FP-91699601]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0841758]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; NSF EID [EF-0914384, EF-0914866]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1RO1AI069217-01]",We thank Mercedes Pascual for comments on this paper and the Ecological Society of America for sponsoring the symposium on climate change and disease that helped develop the ideas presented here.

Recent forecasts for future climates emphasize altered temperature variation and precipitation, but most studies of animals have largely focused on forecasting the outcome of changes in mean temperature. Theory suggests that extreme thermal variation and precipitation will influence species performance and hence affect their response to changes in climate. Using an information-theoretic approach, we show that in squamate ectotherms (mostly lizards and snakes), two fitness-influencing components of performance, the critical thermal maximum and the thermal optimum, are more closely related to temperature variation and to precipitation, respectively, than they are to mean thermal conditions. By contrast, critical thermal minimum is related to mean annual temperature. Our results suggest that temperature variation and precipitation regimes have had a strong influence on the evolution of ectotherm performance, so that forecasts for animal responses to climate change will have to incorporate these factors and not only changes in average temperature.",,,,"Blackburn, Tim/AAC-3144-2019; Blackburn, Tim M/A-7685-2011; Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011","Blackburn, Tim/0000-0003-0152-2663; Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105",Stellenbosch University,The authors thank A.

These studies have chiefly focused on the type of occurrence data to use for model calibration. Additionally, pseudo-absences are also known to cause uncertainty in NBM, but are rarely tested for predicting invasiveness. Here we test the implications of using different calibration sets for building worldwide invasiveness models for four major problematic decapods: Cherax destructor, Eriocheir sinensis, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Using Artificial Neural Networks models we compared predictions containing either native range occurrences (NRO), native and invasive occurrences (NIO) and invasive only (IRO) coupled with three types of pseudo-absences - based on sampling only 1) the native range (NRA), 2) native and invasive ranges (NIA), and 3) worldwide random (WRA). We further analysed the potential gains in accuracy obtained through averaging across multiple models. Our results showed that NRO and IRO provided the best predictions for native and invaded ranges, respectively. Still, NIO provided the best balance in predicting both ranges. Pseudo-absences had a large influence on the predictive performance of the models, and were more important for predictiveness than types of occurrences. Specifically, WRA performed the best and NRA and NIA performed poorly. We also found little benefit in combining predictions since best performing single-models showed consistently higher accuracies. We conclude that NBM can provide useful information in forecasting invasiveness but are largely dependent on the type of initial information used and more efforts should be placed on recognizing its implications. Our results also show extensive areas which are highly suitable for the studied species worldwide. In total these areas reach from three to nine times the species current ranges and large portions of them are contiguous with currently invasive populations.",,,,"Anastacio, Pedro/B-4716-2008; Capinha, Cesar/K-6439-2017","Anastacio, Pedro/0000-0003-1808-3847; Capinha, Cesar/0000-0002-0666-9755",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/BIA-BEC/105182/2008]; FEDEREuropean Union (EU); QREN; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/41129/2007],"We thank the many researchers and institutions that provided species distribution data and three anonymous reviewers and the Subject Editor for their helpful comments.

A critical assumption for projecting climate change responses is that SDMs are transferable through time, an assumption that is largely untested because investigators often lack temporally independent data for assessing transferability. Further, understanding how the ecology of species influences temporal transferability is critical yet almost wholly lacking. This raises two questions. (1) Are SDM projections transferable in time? (2) Does temporal transferability relate to species ecological traits? To address these questions we developed SDMs for 133 vascular plant species using data from the mountain ranges of California (USA) from two time periods: the 1930s and the present day. We forecast historical models over 75 years of measured climate change and assessed their projections against current distributions. Similarly, we hindcast contemporary models and compared their projections to historical data. We quantified transferability and related it to species ecological traits including physiognomy, endemism, dispersal capacity, fire adaptation, and commonness. We found that non-endemic species with greater dispersal capacity, intermediate levels of prevalence, and little fire adaptation had higher transferability than endemic species with limited dispersal capacity that rely on fire for reproduction. We demonstrate that variability in model performance was driven principally by differences among species as compared to model algorithms or time period of model calibration. Further, our results suggest that the traits correlated with prediction accuracy in a single time period may not be related to transferability between time periods. Our findings provide a priori guidance for the suitability of SDM as an approach for forecasting climate change responses for certain taxa.",,,,"Dobrowski, Solomon/Q-7132-2019; Crimmins, Shawn/M-1809-2013; Crimmins, Shawn/C-6972-2012","Dobrowski, Solomon/0000-0003-2561-3850; Greenberg, Jonathan/0000-0001-8435-9077; Thorne, James/0000-0002-9130-9921",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0819430]; California Energy Commission [CEC PIR-08-006],"The authors acknowledge funding provided by the National Science Foundation (grant award #0819430) and the California Energy Commission PIER Program (CEC PIR-08-006).

Current models describe the dynamics of only one sex (typically females). Such models cannot account for the sex-related biases in dispersal and mating behavior that are typical of many animal species. In this article, we construct a two-sex integrodifference equation model that overcomes these limitations. We derive an explicit formula for the invasion speed from the model and use it to show that sex-biased dispersal may significantly increase or decrease the invasion speed by skewing the operational sex ratio at the invasion's low-density leading edge. Which of these possible outcomes occurs depends sensitively on complex interactions among the direction of dispersal bias, the magnitude of bias, and the relative contributions of females and males to local population growth.",,,,"Shaw, Allison/E-7161-2010","Shaw, Allison/0000-0001-7969-8365; Neubert, Michael/0000-0001-8820-5008","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0235692, DEB-0816838]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [CSREES-2007-02270]; Rice University; Andrew W.

Kallimanis hypothesized that TSD species currently inhabiting stable climatic conditions show reduced population growth rates at the edges of their distributional ranges; under warming conditions, these populations will experience faster growth rates and thus are able to colonize new suitable sites. These ideas are based on the assumption that populations of TSD species have balanced sex ratios at the core of their geographic ranges and biased proportions at the edges. However, Kallimanis' model overlooks complex processes that may produce a more broadly and less predictable aftermath of climate change on TSD species, so we discuss some of his postulates and underlying assumptions. Kallimanis' model is based only on one of three known TSD strategies in reptiles, thus it lacks generality; and it does not consider the phenological, behavioral, and physiological strategies that TSD species exhibit across their geographic ranges to buffer the potential impacts of climatic variation over the whole reproductive process. We conclude that simple models such as the one proposed by Kallimanis are not broadly applicable; hence, forecasts of TSD species' responses to climate change will need to be more specific to groups with similar ecologies and modes of TSD.",,,,"Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino/M-3913-2015","Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino/0000-0001-7347-714X; Martinez-Meyer, Enrique/0000-0003-1184-9264","Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico, of the Univ.

Location East Texas and Louisiana, USA. Methods We drew upon extensive field data from the US Forest Service and the US Geological Survey to calculate spread rate from 2003 to 2008 and to parameterize logistic regression models estimating habitat quality for Chinese tallow within individual habitat cells. We applied the regression analyses to represent population spread rate as a function of habitat quality, integrated this function into a logistic model representing local spread, and coupled this model with a dispersal model based on a lognormal kernel within the simulation framework. We simulated invasions beginning in 2003 based on several different dispersal velocities and compared the resulting spatial patterns to those observed in 2008 using cross Mantel's tests. We then used the best dispersal velocity to predict range expansion to the year 2023. Results Chinese tallow invasion is more likely in low and flat areas adjacent to water bodies and roads, and less likely in mature forest stands and in pine plantations where artificial regeneration by planting seedlings is used. Forecasted invasions resulted in a distribution that extended from the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana northward and westward as much as 300 km, representing approximately 1.58 million ha. Main conclusions Our new approach of calculating time series projections of annual range expansion should assist land managers and restoration practitioners plan proactive management strategies and treatments. Also, as field sampling continues on the national array of FIA plots, these new data can be incorporated easily into the present model, as well as being used to develop and/or improve models of other invasive plant species.",,,,"Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan/AAE-7933-2020","Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan/0000-0002-7850-0406",USDA Forest Service Forest Health Protection of the Southern RegionUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Texas AgriLife Research,"We thank the USDA Forest Service Forest Health Protection of the Southern Region and Texas AgriLife Research for funding this study.

Patches of the dominant biological crust moss Syntrichia caninervis were exposed to field treatments of low and high nitrogen supplementation, added summer rain, and combinations thereof, for a period of five years. In the lab, shoots were subjected to a moderate (single rapid-dry treatment) and a severe (double rapid-dry treatment) desiccation stress. Shoots were then hydrated and allowed to regenerate for 6 weeks on sterile sand. Shoots exhibited lower above-ground biomass from the +monsoon treatment, indicating carbon balance deficits under conditions of recurring summer rainfall. The low N treatment and the severe desiccation stress promoted shoot burning (chlorosis) and negatively affected regeneration responses. High N treatment, however, only adversely affected the resumption of apical meristematic growth. Summer irrigation and N application interacted to mitigate the effects of later protonemal emergence time, lower protonemal cover, and lower shoot numbers. Increased monsoonal frequency and higher N deposition as forecast for the northern Mojave Desert may result in declines in shoot biomass and reduced regenerational vigor in S. caninervis.

It also supports a high biodiversity of endemic rocky intertidal species. Although the distributions of many of these species were qualitatively described several decades ago, little quantitative data on abundance, distribution and diversity has been collected across a range of spatial scales from local to biogeographical. Without such data it is difficult to assess range dynamics and connectivity of endemic and climate-sensitive species and assemblages, and thus predict responses to future impacts of climate warming, sea level rise, coastal squeeze and ocean acidification. This paper documents the geographic distributions, abundances and assemblage patterns of intertidal limpets at 63 sites around the New Zealand coast. Limpets are key functional components of most temperate ecosystems, influencing patterns of invertebrate-macroalgal dominance, carbon cycling and biodiversity. In contrast to continental-scale studies in other temperate systems, limpet assemblages were not more similar at the level of the biogeographic province, and only weak associations were found with biogeographic region. Limpet assemblages did differ between sites, but no spatial pattern was evident. Species distributions and assemblage structures did also not appear to be strongly influenced by environmental factors including temperature, coverage of key structural taxa including barnacles, mussels and macroalgae, or other potentially competing grazers. Limpet diversity was highest at some exposed locations, but there was no national trend. In general, the high variability we observed in individual species abundances at local, regional and biogeographic scales suggests that small scale, local factors rather than broad biogeographic drivers determine New Zealand rocky intertidal limpet assemblages. This creates a challenge for ecological forecasting of future responses to global environmental change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the spatial and temporal complexity of the shoreline's thermal environment challenges ecologists' ability to progress from site-specific measurements to general predictions. In this study, we conducted intensive field experiments to quantify inter-individual variation in body temperature among organisms and surrogate organisms at a typical intertidal site, and we used these measurements to characterize micro-scale variation in potential thermal stress. Within the 336-m extent of our site, local variation was substantial in several metrics of extreme and cumulative thermal exposure. The within-site variation in extreme temperatures rivaled (and in some cases greatly exceeded) variation among sites along 14 degrees of latitude (1660 km of Pacific shoreline). Application of our within-site data to a simple theory of risk suggests that small-scale spatial variation in temperature can reduce the chance of local extirpation that otherwise would accompany an increase in average habitat temperature or an increase in the frequency of extreme thermal events. The magnitude of this ""buffering"" effect also depends heavily on inter-individual variation in thermal tolerance, a factor that has received relatively little attention from physiologists. We hope that by highlighting the important role of within-site variability (both of temperature and tolerance) in the persistence of intertidal populations, this study will foster further research into the biophysical, physiological, behavioral, and genetic interactions underlying ecological dynamics on wave-washed shores.

Environmental consequences include increasing water temperatures, and evidence of ecological responses to current warming in marine coastal ecosystems is found in poleward shifts in the geographic range of species as well as changes in the composition of nearshore benthic communities. Most evidence has, however, been obtained from intertidal studies, but similar shifts should be occurring for subtidal communities as well, especially for the ecologically important kelp species that provide both food and shelter to a multitude of organisms. Kelp may be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their cold-water affinities and limited dispersal ability. A major biogeographic transition occurs along northwest Atlantic shores of Canada between subarctic and boreal zones where major shifts can be seen in the composition of kelp assemblages of Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Saccharina longicruris and Saccharina latissima. Here we review the historic and recent distribution and abundance of these species and find no evidence of changes in the past century. However, sparse coverage of data, inconsistent methodology and a lack of adequate time series prevent us from concluding that no changes have occurred, especially with respect to natural variation and anthropogenic alteration. These shortcomings illustrate the need for identifying sentinel species and sites for studies dedicated to the specific questions of climate-induced changes in kelp abundance and distribution. We suggest that a combination of traditional and modern tools (e.g., benthic surveys and climate model forecasting, respectively) offers the best path forward.

We evaluated the population-level variation in temperature tolerance in populations of several marine invertebrate taxa, including bryozoans, tunicates, bivalves, and gastropods, separated by distances of <200 km to >5000 km. We then combined physiological thermotolerance data with current temperature data and climate change predictions to predict which of these populations may be most vulnerable to future changes. In a trans-continental comparison of four subtidal epibenthic species, we show that populations on the east coast of the United States, which experienced higher habitat temperatures than those on the west coast, had higher thermal tolerances but lived closer to individuals' tolerance limits. Similarly, temperature tolerances varied between western and eastern Atlantic populations of the mussel Mytilus edulis; however, these differences only emerged after repeated exposures to high temperatures. Furthermore, the less thermotolerant M. edulis population in the western Atlantic was more susceptible to temperature increases, as evidenced by a recent range contraction. Thus, for both the subtidal epibenthic and intertidal mussel species, we identified the western Atlantic as a 'hot spot' of populations susceptible to climate change compared to those in the eastern Pacific and eastern Atlantic, respectively. Finally, because current tolerances are not the sole indicators of individuals' abilities to cope with temperature increases, we also assessed the possibility for acclimatization to facilitate the persistence of populations via the buffering of temperature effects. We show that, for four populations of intertidal Littorina snail species in the northwest Atlantic, most populations were able to overcome geographic differences in temperature tolerance via acclimation. When acclimation capacity is low, the potential for ""rescue"" may depend on the particular species' life-history strategy and dispersal ability. For example, although individuals from the coldest-adapted population of Littorina littorea were unable to acclimate as quickly as those from more southern populations, this species has a pelagic larval stage and, thus, the greatest dispersal potential of these littorines. Together, these studies highlight the importance of considering variation in temperature tolerance between populations within species to improve the forecasting of changes in the abundances and distributions of species in response to climate warming.

Indirect effects not only yield ""unexpected results"", but also some of the strongest ecological effects (i.e. phase-shifts) that have been regarded as ""catastrophes"" on coral reefs, ""collapses"" of kelp forests and ""crises"" in seagrass meadows. Such effects went unanticipated because the impact of one species on another required knowledge of a third element that was inadequately understood. Subsequent debate over the causes of habitat loss has often been polarised by two extreme points of view, i.e. consumer versus producer effects. It is our perspective that these debates will persist unless we clarify the context-dependency of two kinds of indirect effect: those driven by strong consumer effects and those driven by strong producer effects. On human-dominated coasts, loss of coral, kelp and seagrass can occur as a function of change in trophic cascades (i.e. consumer effects) as well as change to competitive hierarchies (i.e. producer competition for resources). Because production and consumption are under strong physiological control by climate (providing predictable responses), there is merit in recognising the type and context of indirect effects to reduce errors associated with model-based forecasting. Indeed, forecasts of how global (e.g. elevated temperature and CO2) and local drivers (e.g. fishing and pollution) combine to drive ecological change will often depend on the relative strength of different kinds of indirect effects (i.e. consumer effects vs producer effects). By recognising the context-dependency of the indirect effects under investigation, the information content of forecasts may not only increase, but also provide an improved understanding of indirect effects and community ecology in general.

With the current issue of sustainable urban development in the cities, urban planners are beginning to look into different aspects of urban climatic parameters and incorporate them as the design parameters. However, it is rather difficult for the planners to attempt to design without engaging the urban climate scientists. Presently, Geographical Information System (GIS) is a platform commonly used in various geographical related research and applications, including those relating to urban climate research, as it can be used to analyze different urban climatic parameters. Although it is, by all standards, an appropriate urban design tool, urban planners tend not to embrace this technology.

These tools aim to quantify fluxes of nutrients and carbon in the ocean and are, increasingly, the base of future projections. For this purpose it is crucial to quantify and identify the sources of uncertainties. In contrast to physical models, the underlying equations for ecosystem models are derived from empirical relationships rather than based on first principles. This resulted in the development of a multitude of different ecosystem models - different in respect to both, underlying principles and complexity. Clearly, the question arises, to what extent the sensitivities of these models are comparable. This study focuses on the intrinsic dynamics of some widely used, simple (containing 2-3 prognostic variables) ecosystem models in a 0-D framework (i.e., comprising only the well-mixed oceanic surface layer). A suite of differing model approaches is tuned such that their behavior is similar. The setup resembles the well-mixed oceanic surface layer in the Baltic proper. It is illustrated that strong differences between the model approaches appear due to exemplary, anticipated changes in the external nutrient and light conditions. Herewith, we demonstrate the well-known, but rarely demonstrated fact that, apparent consistency between modeled prognostic variables with today's data bases is not necessarily a good measure of forecast skill. The causes which lead to the different sensitivities are illustrated by considering the steady state solutions. It is pointed out, that apparently small changes in the model formulations can result in very different dynamical behavior and an enormous spread between the model approaches, despite the feasibility to tune a common behavior in a limited range of light and nutrient supply. In our examples, the sensitivity is mainly a function of the formulation of the loss rate of phytoplankton. It is thus, in particular, the formulation of highly unknown heteorotrophic processes that determines the model sensitivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Where populations are confined to fragmented, human-dominated landscapes, preventing declines and extirpations will often rely on metapopulation management. Spatially-explicit population viability analyses provide tools to evaluate how well the local management efforts can be combined to conserve metapopulations across large areas. Yet, metapopulation models have rarely been combined with tools to assess the cost-effectiveness of different conservation strategies. 2. European bison Bison bonasus only occur in small, fragmented populations, making their long-term survival dependent on establishing a metapopulation across eastern Europe. We parameterized a European bison metapopulation model based on time-series of bison demography and a habitat suitability map to assess the viability of bison populations in the Carpathians and the relative cost-effectiveness of (i) reintroductions, (ii) wildlife overpasses and (iii) anti-poaching measures in establishing a viable bison metapopulation. 3. Our results suggest that the Carpathians could support a viable metapopulation of European bison provided that active efforts are taken to safeguard bison and connect isolated herds. With such steps, our model forecasts that bison numbers could increase substantially over the next 100 years as local populations increase and bison recolonize parts of the Carpathians. 4. Reintroductions appear to be the most cost-effective approach for establishing a viable bison metapopulation among our scenarios, especially when coupled with wildlife overpasses to improve connectivity among herds. The most promising region for a bison metapopulation in the Carpathians was south-eastern Poland, Ukraine and northern Romania. We identified several candidate regions for reintroductions and wildlife overpasses, especially in the border region of Romania and Ukraine. Site-specific assessments of both habitat suitability, and the costs and benefits of a large bison population, should target those regions. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight how careful conservation planning can identify solutions to preserve large mammals in human-dominated landscapes. Choosing the most effective option from a range of management strategies is a central challenge for wildlife managers. We have shown that incorporating cost-effectiveness analyses into metapopulation models can elucidate the relative value (gain per unit cost) of different conservation management options, allowing decision makers to choose cost-effective options to preserve large mammals. Our model projections also provide hope for establishing a viable free-ranging European bison population in the Carpathians, one of the last relatively wild areas in Europe.",,,,"Kuemmerle, Tobias/B-4340-2008; Ivan, Parnikoza/O-2781-2019; Radeloff, Volker/B-6124-2016; Akcakaya, H.

Individual killer whales often participate in group activities such as prey sharing and cooperative hunting. The estimated age-specific survival probabilities and survivorship curves differed considerably among pods and to a lesser extent among matrilines (within pods). Across all pods, males had lower life expectancy than females. Differences in survival between pods may be caused by a combination of factors that vary across the population's range, including reduced prey availability, contaminants in prey, and human activity.

Yet the potential consequences of climate-induced plant species losses for the functioning of these ecosystems are poorly understood. We investigated how climate change might alter the functional composition of grasslands for Konza Prairie, a diverse tallgrass prairie in central North America. With species-specific climate envelopes, we show that a reduction in mean annual precipitation would preferentially remove species that are more abundant in the more productive lowland positions at Konza. As such, decreases in precipitation could reduce productivity not only by reducing water availability but by also removing species that inhabit the most productive areas and respond the most to climate variability. In support of this prediction, data on species abundance at Konza over 16 years show that species that are more abundant in lowlands than uplands are preferentially reduced in years with low precipitation. Climate change is likely to also preferentially remove species from particular functional groups and clades. For example, warming is forecast to preferentially remove perennials over annuals as well as Cyperaceae species. Despite these predictions, climate change is unlikely to unilaterally alter the functional composition of the tallgrass prairie flora, as many functional traits such as physiological drought tolerance and maximum photosynthetic rates showed little relationship with climate envelope parameters. In all, although climatic drying would indirectly alter grassland productivity through species loss patterns, the insurance afforded by biodiversity to ecosystem function is likely to be sustained in the face of climate change.",,,,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; McLauchlan, Kendra/0000-0002-6612-1097; Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X; Kembel, Steven/0000-0001-5224-0952",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816629]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),The authors thank Valerie Wright and other volunteers for collecting phenology data.

Accurately forecasting where and when predation will occur has the potential to optimize predation management. Survival analysis, a set of statistical techniques recently popularized in studies of avian nest success, provides a unique approach for modelling variation in egg mortality risk throughout development. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model the survival of sea turtle eggs from predation by the small Asian mongoose Herpestes javanicus, a widely introduced and destructive sea turtle nest predator in the Caribbean. We evaluated the ability of models to predict egg survival using 7 years of nest predation data for critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles Eretmochelys imbracata in Barbados. Daily predation risk was the highest for freshly laid nests, decreasing rapidly with nest age but increasing again near the end of development. Predation risk was the highest in and near patches of beach vegetation, increased over the nesting season and increased with nest density on the open beach but not in vegetation. Survival models calibrated using data from 2004 to 2005 showed excellent discrimination and >= 84% accuracy when predicting the fate of nests from previous years. Our study provides the first quantification of the daily variation in predation risk for incubating turtle eggs, revealing a narrow time window early in development during which the application of predation reduction measures is likely to have the greatest impact on nest survival. More generally, we demonstrate the utility of survival analysis for generating fine-scale predictions of spatiotemporal variation in turtle egg mortality, providing a flexible tool for the conservation of sea turtles and other egg-laying reptiles.",,,,"Leighton, Patrick/A-6497-2008; Kramer, Donald L/E-9058-2011",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [213-2003]; Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship; Earthwatch Institute,"We thank A.

The success of these applications relies heavily on the accuracy of the models. Various measures have been proposed to assess the accuracy of the models. Rigorous statistical analysis should be incorporated in model accuracy assessment. However, since relevant information about the statistical properties of accuracy measures is scattered across various disciplines, ecologists find it difficult to select the most appropriate ones for their research. In this paper, we review accuracy measures that are currently used in species distribution modelling (SDM), and introduce additional metrics that have potential applications in SDM. For the commonly used measures (which are also intensively studied by statisticians), including overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and area and partial area under the ROC curves, promising methods to construct confidence intervals and statistically compare the accuracy between two models are given. For other accuracy measures, methods to estimate standard errors are given, which can be used to construct approximate confidence intervals. We also suggest that as general tools, computer-intensive methods, especially bootstrap and randomization methods can be used in constructing confidence intervals and statistical tests if suitable analytic methods cannot be found.

In this study, we model the influence of climate on annual radial growth using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees grown for 34 years in a large provenance experiment in western Canada. We use a random-coefficient modeling approach to build universal growth-trend response functions that simultaneously incorporate the impacts of different provenance and site climates on radial growth trends under present and future annual (growth-year), summer, and winter climate regimes. This approach provides new depth to traditional quantitative genetics population response functions by illustrating potential changes in population dominance over time, as well as indicating the age and size at which annual growth begins declining for any population growing in any location under any present or future climate scenario within reason, given the ages and climatic conditions sampled. Our models indicate that lodgepole pine radial-growth levels maximize between 3.9 degrees and 5.1 degrees C mean growth-year temperature. This translates to productivity declining by the mid-21st century in southern and central British Columbia (BC), while increasing beyond the 2080s in northern BC and Yukon, as temperatures rise. Relative to summer climate indices, productivity is predicted to decline continuously through the 2080s in all locations, while relative to winter climate variables, the opposite trend occurs, with the growth increases caused by warmer winters potentially offsetting the summer losses. Trees from warmer provenances, i.e., from the center of the species range, perform best in nearly all of our present and future climate-scenario models. We recommend that similar models be used to analyze population growth trends relative to annual and intra-annual climate in other large-scale provenance trials worldwide. An open-access growth-trend data set encompassing numerous biomes, species, and provenances would contribute substantially to predicting forest productivity under future-climate scenarios.",,,,"LeMay, Valerie/V-7731-2019",,Forest Investment Account through the BC Forest Genetics Council; University of British Columbia,"We give our sincere thanks to Sarah Braun Wildeman and Nicholas Ukrainetz for their assistance with sample collection; Tongli Wang for providing climate data, modeling insights, and manuscript reviews; Lori Daniels for teaching dendrochronology techniques; and Christine Chourmouzis for assisting with field work and GIS.

The presence of Brucella abortus within free-ranging wildlife populations is an important conservation and management issue because of the risk of brucellosis transmission between wildlife and livestock. Predicting wildlife distributions is necessary to forecast wildlife and livestock spatial overlap and the potential for brucellosis transmission. 2. We used Global Positioning System data collected from telemetry-collared female elk Cervus elaphus to develop resource selection function (RSF) models during the brucellosis transmission risk period (the abortion and calving periods). We validated extrapolation of predictive models at two nearby elk ranges within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Additionally, we integrated extrapolated RSF maps and domestic livestock distributions to estimate the relative probability of elk and livestock commingling during the brucellosis transmission risk period. 3. The top-ranked model predicted that areas selected by elk had a lower probability of wolf Canis lupus occupancy, were privately owned and south facing, and had steeper slopes, lower road densities and higher Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Elk selected forests and shrublands over grasslands; however, the strength of selection decreased as snowpack increased. Elk selection for privately owned lands may lead to spatial overlap with livestock and increase the risk of elk and livestock intermingling. Furthermore, if both elk and livestock concentrate in areas of higher NDVI, increased spatial overlap may occur in these areas. 4. Predictive accuracy was highest in the study area where the model was developed. When compared to the model development area, predictive accuracy of extrapolated RSF maps was similar or better in one of the elk ranges and lower in the other elk range. 5. Synthesis and applications. Extrapolated RSF and spatial overlap maps can provide a foundation for identifying the highest risk areas of elk and livestock spatial overlap during the brucellosis transmission risk period. However, the predictive accuracy of the models is limited when applied to different areas. Site-specific models of spatial overlap would therefore be needed to provide the most accurate estimates of elk and livestock spatial overlap during the transmission risk period. The degree to which spatial overlap may lead to actual transmission risk needs to be investigated as this is not yet known and could have important implications for managing transmission risk.",,,,,,Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration; US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee routed through Montana Department of Livestock,"Funding was provided by revenues from the sale of Montana hunting and fishing licenses, a Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration grant to Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, and a grant to Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks from the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee routed through the Montana Department of Livestock.

Marmorkrebs have already been introduced in several countries, have successfully established populations in at least two of them, and are rapidly expanding in one case (Madagascar). To assess the potential ecological threat arising from further Marmorkrebs introductions, we developed four species distribution models using the distribution of Procambarus fallax (the sexual form of Marmorkrebs) and exotic populations of Marmorkrebs in Madagascar and Europe. The models were applied to three regions where Marmorkrebs pose a conservation concern: Madagascar, where Marmorkrebs populations are growing; Europe, where individuals have been found repeatedly, and where some Marmorkrebs populations arc becoming established, and; North America, where Marmorkrebs are sold as pets, which presents a risk of introduction into North American ecosystems. All models predicted that eastern Madagascar provides suitable habitat for Marmorkrebs. Most models suggested that relatively small areas of Europe are suitable habitat, although a model that includes locations of Marmorkrebs introductions in Europe predicts much of Europe could be suitable, which is supported by recent discoveries of populations in Germany. All models predicted that the south eastern United States, Cuba, and much of Mexico arc also potential habitats.

Theories of adaptive habitat selection are particularly promising because they link distribution and density with fitness. The evolutionarily stable strategy that emerges from adaptive habitat choice is given by the system's habitat isodar, the graph of densities in pairs of habitats such that the expectation of fitness is the same in each. We illustrate how isodars can be converted into adaptive landscapes of habitat selection that display the density- and frequency-dependent fitness of competing strategies of habitat use. The adaptive landscape varies with the abundance of habitats and can thus be used to predict future adaptive distributions of individuals under competing scenarios of habitat change. Application of the theory to three species of Arctic rodents living on Herschel Island in the Beaufort Sea predicts changes in selection gradients as xeric upland increases in frequency with global warming. Selection gradients will become more shallow for brown lemming (Lemmus trimucronatus) and tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus) strategies that preferentially exploit mesic habitat. Climate change will cause selection gradients for the alternative strategy of using mostly xeric habitat to become much steeper. Meanwhile, the adaptive landscape for collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), which specialize on xeric Dryas-covered upland, will become increasingly convex. Changes in the adaptive landscapes thus predict expanding niches for Lemmus and Microtus, and a narrower niche for Dicrostonyx.

We aim to elucidate the role of meso-scale dispersal barriers in climate-tracking responses. Location South coast of England (the English Channel). Methods Historical distributional data of four intertidal invertebrate species were logistically regressed against sea surface temperature (SST) to determine a climate envelope. This envelope was used to estimate the expected climate-tracking response since 1990 along the coast, which was compared with observed range expansions. A hydrodynamic modelling approach was used to identify dispersal barriers and explore disparities between expected and observed climate tracking. Results Range shifts detected by field survey over the past 20 years were less than those predicted by the changes that have occurred in SST. Hydrodynamic model simulations indicated that physical barriers produced by complex tidal currents have variably restricted dispersal of pelagic larvae amongst the four species. Main conclusions We provide the first evidence that meso-scale hydrodynamic barriers have limited climate-induced range shifts and demonstrate that life history traits affect the ability of species to overcome such barriers. This suggests that current forecasts may be flawed, both by overestimating range shifts and by underestimating climatic tolerances of species.

Location Western Mediterranean coast. Methods The analysis of naturally occurring stable isotopes constitutes an exceptional approach to assess variations in the trophic ecology of species within the spatiotemporal dimensions. Here, we examined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in resource exploitation of a nuisance and overpopulated gull species with a great feeding plasticity, the Yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis, by measuring the stable isotope ratios of carbon (13C/12C, delta 13C), nitrogen (15N/14N, delta 15N) and sulphur (34S/33S, delta 34S) in different wing feathers. Results Tracing isotopic changes among feathers in relation to moulting sequence, we showed that isotopic analyses on first primary feathers were good indicators of breeding trophic ecology, while others, such as eighth secondary feathers, reflected the feeding behaviour during the non-breeding period. This knowledge was then used to report on estimations of seasonal feeding patterns throughout the year for seven gull populations along the Western Mediterranean coast. Main conclusions The high diversity in the exploitation patterns of the foraging habitats found in the study area both at spatial and at temporal scale indicated the opportunistic feeding behaviour of Yellow-legged gulls. Proposed isotopic approach has revealed as a useful tool to evaluate spatiotemporal variations in the feeding ecology of populations which may become clue for dealing with the management of wild species, not only nuisance populations but also endangered species. We finally pointed out the relevance of the isotopic variability among individuals to infer diet diversity and food availability of a given population, thereby allowing demographic forecasts when trophic resources vary in abundance.",,,,"Jover, Lluis/D-2192-2011; Ramirez, Francisco/I-3553-2014; Carrasco, Josep L./D-3660-2011; Ramos, Raul/S-3112-2016","Jover, Lluis/0000-0003-0631-1398; Ramirez, Francisco/0000-0001-9670-486X; Carrasco, Josep L./0000-0003-1184-0753; Ramos, Raul/0000-0002-0551-8605","MCINN (Spain) [REN2003-07050, CGL2008-05448-C02]","We dedicate this article to the memory of Xavier Ruiz, who unexpectedly died on 27 April 2008 when we were writing this manuscript.

We modelled the spread of North American wind-dispersed trees in current and future (c. 2060) conditions, accounting for variation in 10 key dispersal, demographic and environmental factors affecting population spread. Predicted spread rates vary substantially among 12 study species, primarily due to inter-specific variation in maturation age, fecundity and seed terminal velocity. Future spread is predicted to be faster if atmospheric CO2 enrichment would increase fecundity and advance maturation, irrespective of the projected changes in mean surface windspeed. Yet, for only a few species, predicted wind-driven spread will match future climate changes, conditioned on seed abscission occurring only in strong winds and environmental conditions favouring high survival of the farthest-dispersed seeds.

These invasions have serious ecological and economic impacts. Human activities such as recreational boating are an important pathway for dispersal. Gravity models are used to quantify the dispersal effect of human activity. Gravity models currently used in ecology are deterministic. This paper proposes the use of stochastic gravity models in ecology, which provides new capabilities both in model building and in potential model applications. These models allow us to use standard statistical inference tools such as maximum likelihood estimation and model selection based on information criteria. To facilitate prediction, we use only those covariates that are easily available from common data sources and can be forecasted in future. This is important for forecasting the spread of invasive species in geographical and temporal domain. The proposed model is portable, that is it can be used for estimating relative boater traffic and hence relative propagule pressure for the lakes not covered by current boater surveys. This makes our results broadly applicable to various invasion prediction and management models. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

To this end, we require the accumulation of temporal records which is evidently time consuming. Progress in spatial data capturing has enabled rapid and accurate assessment of species distribution across large scales. Therefore, it would be appealing to infer the temporal trends of populations from the spatial structure of their distributions. Based on a combination of models from the fields of range dynamics, occupancy scaling and spatial autocorrelation, here I present a model for forecasting the population trend solely from its spatial distribution. Numerical tests using cellular automata confirm a positive correlation, as inferred from the model, between the temporal change in species range sizes and the exponent of the power-law scaling pattern of occupancy. The model is thus recommended for rapid estimation of species range dynamics from a single snapshot of its current distribution. Further applications in biodiversity conservation could provide a swift risk assessment, especially, for endangered and invasive species. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, false absences and missing data can lead to underestimates of the number of sites contributing to connectivity, resulting in overestimates of dispersal ability and turnovers (extinctions plus colonizations). We extend estimation methods for the IFM by using a hierarchical Bayesian model to account both for false absences due to imperfect detection and for missing data due to sites not surveyed in some years. We compare parameter estimates, measures of metapopulation dynamics, and forecasts using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) among three IFM models: (1) a Bayesian formulation assuming no false absences and omitting site-year combinations with missing data; (2) a hierarchical Bayesian formulation assuming no false absences but incorporating missing data; and (3) a hierarchical Bayesian formulation allowing for imperfect detection and incorporating missing data. We fit the models to multiyear data sets of occupancy for two bird species that differ in body size and presumed dispersal ability but inhabit the same network of sites: the small Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and the medium-sized Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola). Incorporating missing data affected colonization parameters and led to lower estimates of dispersal ability for the Black Rail. Detection rates were high for the Black Rail in most years but moderate for the Virginia Rail. Incorporating imperfect detection resulted in higher occupancy and lower turnover rates for both species, with largest effects for the Virginia Rail. Forecasts using SPOMs were sensitive to both missing data and false absences; persistence in models assuming no false absences was more optimistic than from robust models. Our results suggest that incorporating false absences and missing data into the IFM can improve (1) estimates of dispersal ability and the effect of connectivity on colonization, (2) the scaling of extinction risk with patch area, and (3) forecasts of occupancy and turnover rates.",,,,"Beissinger, Steven R/F-3809-2012",,UC-Davis Wildlife Health Center; California Department of Fish and Game Resource; Sacramento Audubon; Sierra Foothills Audubon; American Ornithologists' Union; Garden Club of America; American Museum of Natural History; California Agricultural Experiment Station; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; A.

The DJBZ started encouraging better management of the collections, evolving towards focused reference collections, where all specimens have well-documented collection data. The objective is to link all collections to a scientific referee. This has already been achieved for a number of taxa. The herbarium of the DSE (acronym P) is among the world's largest (11 million specimens, including 400,000 types). The collection's heterogeneity impedes access to its data, since P is a mix of recent well-documented collections and historical collections at various curational levels. P is currently under renovation, which started by mounting all ca. 2 million unmounted specimens. The project also includes databasing and imaging of every specimen. The database now holds around 1,000,000 records. For taxonomic studies, living collections are crucial, especially for plants that are not easily preserved as herbarium specimens. Living collections also enable studies impossible to forecast at the time of collecting.

Here, we present an approach to forecasting the range expansion of the nonindigenous green crab Carcinus in Japanese waters, with consideration of the human-mediated shipping and natural dispersal. Two types of shipping, namely, primary transport to Japan via long-distance ocean-going shipping and secondary transport within Japan via short-distance coastal shipping, were considered. The presence and absence of the crab in 50-km shoreline segments were obtained at 5 year intervals from 1985 to 2005, based on observation records by professional and amateur naturalists. Two types of dispersal kernel, namely, conventional logistic regression and a multiplicative immigration model considering multiple pathways explicitly, were compared. The multiplicative immigration model gave significantly better results. Natural dispersal was the most significant factor, in spite of its low expansion rate: secondary transport by coastal shipping was the second. Transport by international ocean-going shipping was not statistically significant, suggesting quite a small immigration probability of the crab by long voyages. Stochastic simulations forecasted that the crab will invade most of the coasts of western Japan along the Pacific Ocean and Seto Inland Sea by 2055, and will become widespread all over the country by 2205. Quarantine scenarios to eliminate transport by vessels revealed that preventing crab transport by domestic coastal vessels may delay the arrival of crabs in Hokkaido and the northern Japan area by 700 years at maximum.",,,,"Koike, Fumito/F-5774-2011","Koike, Fumito/0000-0002-6588-6485","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18510208]","We are grateful to Michio Otani (Marine Ecological Institute, Inc.) for advice on trade and shipping data.

Models that accurately predict where new invasions will occur could guide the efficient allocation of resources to slow colonization. We assessed the accuracy of a model that predicts the probability of colonization of lakes in Wisconsin by Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). We based this predictive model on 9 years (1990-1999) of sequence data of milfoil colonization of lakes larger than 25 ha (n = 1803). We used milfoil colonization sequence data from 2000 to 2006 to test whether the model accurately predicted the number of lakes that actually were colonized from among the 200 lakes identified as being most likely to be colonized. We found that a lake's predicted probability of colonization was not correlated with whether a lake actually was colonized. Given the low predictability of colonization of specific lakes, we compared the efficacy of preventing milfoil from leaving occupied sites, which does not require predicting colonization probability, with protecting vacant sites from being colonized, which does require predicting colonization probability. Preventing organisms from leaving colonized sites reduced the likelihood of spread more than protecting vacant sites. Although we focused on the spread of a single species in a particular region, our results show the shortcomings of gravity models in predicting the spread of numerous non-native species to a variety of locations via a wide range of vectors.",,,,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IRCEB DEB 02-13698]; Great Lakes Protection Fund [797]; University of Notre Dame,"We thank M.

Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns will also remobilize and modify chemical partitioning. Holding millions of cubic yards of sediments contaminated with persistent legacy chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, the Laurentian Great Lakes are a laboratory for observing interactions between biological and chemical responses to climate change. They provide a wide range of habitat to a variety of species, from littoral forage fish to deep-water predators. In this paper, we couple bioenergetic and bioaccumulation models to investigate the biological and chemical effects of climate change in the Great Lakes. We consider three species: round goby, a warm-water invasive forage fish; mottled sculpin, a cool-water native forage fish; and lake trout, a cold-water native predator. Using our coupled models, we calculate the accumulation of a representative persistent chemical, PCB-77, under four climate scenarios for Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Predator-prey (lake trout-round goby) interactions and food availability (high-low) are incorporated into our simulations. For cool- to cold-water species (sculpin, lake trout) we find that warm temperatures limit growth. For warm-water species (round goby) cold temperatures limit growth. The impact of climate warming on growth depends on the winter lows as well as the summer highs of the scenario, in combination with the species' critical upper and lower thermal limits. We find conditions for high growth and consumption rates generally lead to high bioaccumulation. However, this can be confounded by predator-prey dynamics, as mismatches in the temperature preferences of predator and prey can lead to mismatches in relative growth and uptake rates. As predator-prey dynamics are expected to undergo substantial shifts with changing climate, these relative thermal sensitivities will be key in determining the implications of climate change for bioaccumulation, particularly in top predator species.",,,,"Gray, Kimberly A/B-6989-2009; Ng, Carla/F-6130-2011","Ng, Carla/0000-0001-5521-7862",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); GAANNUS Department of Education,"C.

These conditions, however, can already be found today in areas experiencing significant drought; current observations of species' responses to droughts can be used to make predictions about their future responses to climate change. Using otolith analysis, we recreated golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) growth chronologies from two temperate lake populations in southeastern Australia over a 15-year period pre- and during a supraseasonal drought. We related interannual growth variation to landscape-scale changes in temperature and hydrological regimes: fish growth declined as water levels in the lakes dropped during the drought, but this effect was offset by increased growth in warmer years. We hypothesize that golden perch are responding to fluctuations in food availability and intraspecific competition related to water level and to an optimization of physiological growth conditions related to increases in growing season length. Based on our analyses, we made predictions of future growth under a number of climate change scenarios that incorporate forecast deviations in stream-flows and air temperature. Despite climatic models predicting significant declines in future water availability, fish growth may increase due to a disproportionate lengthening of the growing season. As the two lakes are at the limit of the southerly range of golden perch, our results are consistent with previous findings of climate-change driven latitudinal range shifts in a poleward direction. We discuss assumptions concerning the constancy of ecological interactions into the future that warrant further study. Our research provides a novel application of biochronological analysis that could be used elsewhere to further our knowledge of species responses to changing environments.",,,,"Morrongiello, John/E-8716-2011; Brown, Paul/P-8813-2016; Butler, Paul G/D-1905-2012","Morrongiello, John/0000-0002-9608-4151; Brown, Paul/0000-0001-9825-1841; Butler, Paul G/0000-0002-9924-0316; Crook, David/0000-0003-4035-050X","Office of Water, Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE); Fisheries Victoria","We gratefully acknowledge the Office of Water, Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and Fisheries Victoria for financial support and to Paul Bennett (DSE) for managing the project and providing valuable input.

Microrefugia are sites that support locally favorable climates amidst unfavorable regional climates, which allow populations of species to persist outside of their main distributions. Knowledge of the location of microrefugia has important implications for climate change research as it will influence our understanding of the spatial distribution of species through time, their patterns of genetic diversity, and potential dispersal rates in response to climate shifts. Indeed, the implications of microrefugia are profound and yet we know surprisingly little about their climatic basis; what climatic processes can support their subsistence, where they may occur, their climatic traits, and the relevance of these locations for climate change research. Here I examine the climatic basis for microrefugia and assert that the interaction between regional advective influences and local terrain influences will define the distribution and nature of microrefugia. I review the climatic processes that can support their subsistence and from this climatic basis: (1) infer traits of the spatial distribution of microrefugia and how this may change through time; (2) review assertions about their landscape position and what it can tell us about regional climates; and (3) demonstrate an approach to forecasting where microrefugia may occur in the future.

This activity is directly dependent upon the climate, mainly rain. The amount and annual distribution of precipitation determines primary productivity, the energy fixed by plants, which in turn determines the amount of animals that can be produced. The current tendency of climate change will lead to an increase in temperature, changes in rain patterns and higher frequency of extreme events (drought, flooding) that can affect negatively the productivity of these grasslands. In the measure that the relations between production and climate can be known, and that weather forecasting becomes more precise and trustworthy, early alarm systems can be implemented, allowing for the mitigation of the negative consequences of climate change. For instance, through Livestock Alarm Systems it is possible to alert producers about imminent droughts and their consequences for forage availability, so as to reduce financial losses in the short term and ecosystem deterioration in the long term. Climate change is imminent and it is already experimented. The alternatives vis a vis this unavoidable change are adaptations to it in the best possible way, using the knowledge about the function of biological systems and implementing tools that must be available to producers.",,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,3,,,,0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,FEB,2011,36,2,,,,,153,158,,,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000287639600011,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to measure Los Angeles's existing tree canopy cover (TCC), determine if space exists for 1 million additional trees, and estimate future benefits from the planting. High-resolution QuickBird remote sensing data, aerial photographs, and geographic information systems were used to classify land cover types, measure TCC, and identify potential tree planting sites. Benefits were forecast for planting of 1 million trees between 2006 and 2010, and their growth and mortality were projected until 2040. Two scenarios reflected low (17%) and high (56%) mortality rates. Numerical models were used with geographic data and tree size information for coastal and inland climate zones to calculate annual benefits and their monetary value. Los Angeles's existing TCC was 21%, and ranged from 7 to 37% by council district. There was potential to add 2.5 million additional trees to the existing population of approximately 10.8 million, but only 1.3 million of the potential tree sites are deemed realistic to plant. Benefits for the 1-million-tree planting for the 35-year period were $1.33 billion and $1.95 billion for the high- and low-mortality scenarios, respectively. Average annual benefits were $38 and $56 per tree planted. Eighty-one percent of total benefits were aesthetic/other, 8% were stormwater runoff reduction, 6% energy savings, 4% air quality improvement, and less than 1% atmospheric carbon reduction.

To analyze the benthic community dynamics of an intermittent Mediterranean stream (Fuirosos, Spain), we developed a mechanistic model that describes the most important ecosystem components (five functional feeding groups of invertebrates, periphyton, and benthic organic matter) under consideration of important transformation processes. The model is an extension of that developed for application to the prealpine River Sihl (Switzerland). A combination of prior knowledge from the literature and information from field observations within a Bayesian framework is used to constrain plausible ranges of the estimated model parameters and to evaluate the uncertainty of the model outcome. The Bayesian inference resulted in a realistic description of most of the main features of the system, offered insights into the degree of information the data contains about model parameters, and also made it possible to quantify the dependence structure of the parameter estimates. Local and global sensitivity analyses revealed that rate parameters for growth and death of invertebrate functional feeding groups are most influential on the model results and additional information on these parameters would be most helpful to reduce output uncertainty. The study clearly points out the importance of organic matter dynamics, as allochthonous organic matter is the main energy source in this Mediterranean headwater stream. Hydrological disturbances of the system such as droughts and floods lead to complex colonization patterns which would require additional data to support a more detailed description by an extended model. Furthermore, the study shows that it is possible to deal with a complex ecological model with eight state variables and more than 60 parameters in a Bayesian framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A substantial number of leks are censused each year throughout North America providing a combined total of 75,598 counts through 2007, with many leks having >30 years of information. These data sets represent the only long-term database available for Greater Sage-Grouse. We conducted our analyses for 30 Greater Sage-Grouse populations and for all leks surveyed in seven Sage-Grouse Management Zones (SMZs) identified in the Greater Sage-Grouse Comprehensive Conservation Strategy. This approach allowed grouping of leks into biologically meaningful populations, of which 23 offered sufficient data to model annual rates of population change. The best models for describing changes in growth rates of populations and SMZs, using information-theoretic criteria, were dominated by Gompertz-type models assuming density dependence on log abundance. Thirty-eight percent of the total were best described by a Gompertz model with no time lag, 32% with a one-year time lag, and 12% with a two-year time lag. These three types of Gompertz models best portrayed a total of 82% of the populations and SMZs. A Ricker-type model assuming linear density dependence on abundance in the current year was selected for 9% of the cases (SMZs or populations), while an exponential growth model with no density dependence was the best model for the remaining 9% of the cases. The best model in 44% of the cases included declining carrying capacity through time of -1.8% to -11.6% per year and in 18% incorporated lower carrying capacity in the last 20 years (1987-2007) than in the first 20 years (1967-1987). We forecast future population viability across 24 populations, seven SMZs, and the range-wide metapopulation using a hierarchy of best models applied to a starting range-wide minimum of 88,816 male sage-grouse counted on 5,042 leks in 2007 throughout western North America. Model forecasts suggest that at least 13% of the populations but none of the SMZs may decline below effective population sizes of 50 within the next 30 years, while at least 75% of the populations and 29% of the SMZs are likely to decline below effective population sizes of 500 within 100 years if current conditions and trends persist. Preventing high probabilities of extinction in many populations and in some SMZs in the long term will require concerted efforts to decrease continuing loss and degradation of habitat as well as addressing other factors (including West Nile virus) that may negatively affect Greater Sage-Grouse at local scales.",,,,,,,,,,92,93,1,19,,,,,,978-0-520-94868-6,STUD AVIAN BIOL,Stud.

Two scenarios bracket a range of forest projections and provide insights into how wood products markets as well as economic, demographic, and climate changes could affect these future forests. Shifts in the future age distributions of forests are dominated by projected harvest regimes that lead to qualitatively different forest conditions.

Instead of forecasting through community-wide collaboration and backcasting with the creation of one vision through consensus, forecasting used individual interviews to create scenarios and backcasting was conducted separately with each of the six community groups (older women, young women with children, young women without children, young men, older men including fishermen and lobster-catchers, and individuals with formal education) resulting in several visions. To unify the results, we created an organizational matrix that allowed the visions of different community groups to be compared.

A. ostenfeldii can produce several biotoxins, including the recently characterised fast-acting toxins spirolides (SPX). A dual labelling fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) assay was developed for discriminating simultaneously between the closely related taxa A. ostenfeldii and A. peruvianum. Surveys were undertaken throughout the summers of 2006, 2007 and 2008 in Cork Harbour, Ireland, where a mixed community of Alexandrium spp. develops annually. A. peruvianum was not detected but the presence of A. ostenfeldii was confirmed by FISH and morphological analysis. The species never reached high concentrations (max. similar to 200 cells l(-1)) and contributed on average to only 0.4% of the Alexandrium community, usually dominated by A. minutum and A. tamarense (Group III). Although cell concentrations were several orders of magnitude lower, the dynamics of A. ostenfeldii were similar to those of other Alexandrium spp. during the 3 consecutive summers, suggesting a common response to environmental forcing. Analytical chemistry performed on extracts from passive solid-phase adsorption samplers identified lipophilic toxins dominated by okadaic acid, but also 13-desmethyl SPX C and 20-methyl SPX G, with dynamics generally congruent with those of A. ostenfeldii. The passive samplers enabled the quantification of background toxin levels at very low A. ostenfeldii concentrations, showing potential for forecasting of toxic events. The ability to quantify toxic A. ostenfeldii cells within high density microalgal populations of morphologically similar species makes the dual FISH assay valuable for phytoplankton monitoring programs and future biogeographical and population dynamics studies.",,,,,,"ECEuropean Commission Joint Research CentreEuropean Community (EC) [G142, 030270, GOCE-CT-2005-003375]","The authors acknowledge D.

In this study we examined this relationship using 16 yr of annual measurements of herbaceous standing crop recorded at two study sites located on the Corona Range and Livestock Research Center in central New Mexico. Our hypothesis was that end-of-season herbaceous standing crop estimations could be improved using measured soil moisture instead of seasonal accumulations of rainfall as traditionally used for yield prediction. Daily recorded and simulated soil moisture levels were used to estimate the number of days over the growing season when soil moisture by volume was at low (< 20%), intermediate (20% to 30%), or high (>= 30%) levels. Defining regression equations to include either simulated or probe-recorded measures of soil moisture improved the adjusted R(2) of the regression models from 46% for the rainfall model to over 60% for various soil moisture models. Key variables for explaining annual variation in herbaceous production included seasonal moisture conditions, the amount of broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh] Britt. & Rushy) present on the area, and the degree days of temperature accumulated over the growing season. Diurnal daily temperatures near historical averages were most advantageous for forage production. Simulated soil moisture data improved predictive grass yield estimates to a level equivalent to using onsite moisture probes to categorize daily moisture conditions. Potential exists to better predict forage conditions based on forecast information that uses soil moisture data instead of the traditional input of seasonal rainfall totals.",,,,,,"New Mexico State University's Agricultural Experiment Station under a US Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research Service; State of New Mexico; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service Office of Hydrologic DevelopmentNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [DG131W05BU1035]","Research was supported by New Mexico State University's Agricultural Experiment Station under a US Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research Service special grant for Rangeland Ecology Research and a State of New Mexico legislative appropriation for broom snakeweed research.

Current vegetation models employ empirical bioclimatic relationships to predict present-day vegetation patterns and to forecast biodiversity changes and biome shifts under climatic change. In this paper, we consider trade-offs in plant functioning and their responses under climatic changes to forecast and explain changes in plant functional richness and shifts in biome geographic distributions. The Jena Diversity model (JeDi) simulates plant survival according to essential plant functional trade-offs, including ecophysiological processes such as water uptake, photosynthesis, allocation, reproduction and phenology. We use JeDi to quantify changes in plant functional richness and biome shifts between present-day and a range of possible future climates from two SRES emission scenarios (A2 and B1) and seven global climate models using metrics of plant functional richness and functional identity. Our results show (i) a significant loss of plant functional richness in the tropics, (ii) an increase in plant functional richness at mid and high latitudes, and (iii) a pole-ward shift of biomes. While these results are consistent with the findings of empirical approaches, we are able to explain them in terms of the plant functional trade-offs involved in the allocation, metabolic and reproduction strategies of plants. We conclude that general aspects of plant physiological tolerances can be derived from functional trade-offs, which may provide a useful process-and trait-based alternative to bioclimatic relationships. Such a mechanistic approach may be particularly relevant when addressing vegetation responses to climatic changes that encounter novel combinations of climate parameters that do not exist under contemporary climate.",,,,"Kleidon, Axel/O-7843-2014; Schmidtlein, Sebastian/Q-2919-2016; Zaehle, Sonke/C-9528-2017","Kleidon, Axel/0000-0002-3798-0730; Zaehle, Sonke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Pavlick, Ryan/0000-0001-8772-3508; Reu, Bjorn/0000-0001-5271-6420; Proulx, Raphael/0000-0002-9188-9225",,,,,17,17,0,67,,,,1726-4170,,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2011,8,5,,,,,1255,1266,,10.5194/bg-8-1255-2011,,,,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,WOS:000291003200016,,,,,

Prediction of future protected area expansion are uncertain, and depend on understanding the factors that have to date explained the historical pattern and geographic variation in protected area (PA) establishment. We test four major perspectives on factors limiting or facilitating PA creation, differentiating between strict PAs and multiple-use PAs where some resource extraction is permitted. Richer countries had a greater amount of land protection and were more likely to create strict PAs, supporting the view of land protection as an economic amenity, although the magnitude of this effect declines in recent decades. There are also significant differences in amount of protection by political structure, with independent countries tending to protect more land, and education, with countries with high levels of primary education tending to protect more. However, countries with substantial previous protection tend to do less protection and create proportionally fewer strict and more multiple-use PAs. Scenarios of future socioeconomic and political conditions suggest that on balance the amount of protection should increase in many countries, driven by economic prosperity, and by 2030 global land protection is forecast to reach 15-29%. The limiting factor in land protection varies among countries, and sub-Saharan African countries in particular will remain a very hard place for land protection because of low per-capita GDP. Overall, however, more land protection may occur in the next 20 years than has occurred in the previous 20 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We report the results of a major study documenting the longitudinal profiles of birds between 1998 and 2009 within 66 patches of temperate woodland in a heavily cleared and grazed agricultural region of south-eastern Australia. Many researchers have forecast the loss of bird biota from this region and others that also were formerly dominated by temperate woodland. We had sufficient high quality data to analyse the longitudinal profiles of reporting rates for 76 of the 116 individual bird species recorded in our 12-year study. Unexpectedly, only four of the 76 species analysed (5.6%) exhibited a significant negative linear decrease in reporting rate. More surprisingly, 32 (42.1%) exhibited a significant positive linear increase in reporting rate, including several taxa of conservation concern. These increases occurred despite a series of below-average rainfall years. Reporting rates were too low to formally model long-term trends in some other bird species widely considered to be of conservation concern such as the Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura guttata) and Speckled Warbler (Chthonicola sagittata). Many authors have used functional (and other) groups to forecast bird species likely to be lost from Australia's temperate woodlands. However, we found no clear links between life history attributes and long-term trend patterns of species. Our findings contrast with recent findings from other temperate woodland-dominated regions in eastern Australia where losses in bird populations have been documented. However, they parallel other investigations such as in central New South Wales. These similarities among, and differences between, studies suggest regional differences in temporal patterns in bird population dynamics. Many of the observed changes in reporting rates were positive and they provide hope that forecast future losses of a large proportion of existing temperate woodland bird assemblages in south-eastern Australia may not be realised uniformly in all regions.

While forecasting methods are generally lacking, a potential means of predicting future impacts is to examine the effects caused by a nonindigenous species (NIS) at previously invaded locations, i.e., its invasion history. However, given the context dependence of impact and the scarcity of data, it is uncertain whether invasion history can in fact be used to forecast the effects of most introduced species. Using a sample of 19 aquatic NIS listed with the IUCN's 100 World's Worst Alien Invasive Species, we reviewed the literature to determine (1) the amount of information currently available concerning their ecological impacts, (2) if the effects reported to be caused by each NIS are consistent across multiple studies, and (3) whether their invasion histories provide sufficient quantitative information to assess and forecast the severity of their impacts on recipient environments. As a case study, we conducted a meta-analysis and developed models that relate the severity of the impacts of a well-documented invader, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), to two potential predictor variables: biomass and time since introduction. We then tested whether models developed from one set of observations can predict the severity of impacts reported at other sites. Models incorporating biomass and pre-impact conditions explained 91% of the variation in carp impact severity at new locations (i.e., those not used to build the models). For most other NIS, limited availability of comparable quantitative data currently prevents the development of similar empirical models for predicting the severity of future impact. Nonetheless, invasion history can often be used to develop informative predictions concerning the type and direction of impacts to be expected at novel recipient sites.",,,,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Le Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les TechnologiesFQRNT,"We thank K.

While predicting the impact of a NIS has generally proved challenging, forecasting its abundance patterns across potential recipient locations should serve as a useful surrogate method of estimating the relative severity of the impacts to be expected. Yet such approaches have rarely been applied in invasion biology. We used long-term monitoring data for lakes within the state of Minnesota and artificial neural networks to model both the occurrence as well as the abundance of a widespread aquatic NIS, common carp (Cyprinus carpio). We then tested the ability of the resulting models to (1) interpolate to new sites within our main study region, (2) extrapolate to lakes in the neighboring state of South Dakota, and (3) assessed the relative contribution of each variable to model predictions. Our models correctly identified over 83% of sites where carp are either present or absent and explained 73% of the variation in carp abundance for validation lakes in Minnesota (i.e., lakes not used to build the model). When extrapolated to South Dakota, our models correctly classified carp occurrence in 79% of lakes and explained 32% of the variation in carp abundance. Variables related to climate and water quality were found to be the most important predictors of carp distribution. These results demonstrate that ecological niche-based modeling techniques can be used to forecast both the occurrence and abundance patterns of invasive species at a regional scale. Models also yielded sensible predictions when extrapolated to neighboring regions. Such predictions, when combined, should provide more useful estimates of the overall risk posed by NIS on potential recipient systems.",,,,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les TechnologiesFQRNT; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks commission, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources for providing the monitoring data used in this study.

We tested whether a single foraging currency could explain bison (Bison bison) distribution in dissimilar environments: a largely forested environment in Prince Albert National Park (Saskatchewan, Canada) and a prairie environment in Grasslands National Park (Saskatchewan, Canada). We blended extensive behavioral observations, relocations of radio-collared bison, vegetation surveys, and laboratory analyses to spatially link bison distribution in the two parks and expected gains for different nutritional currencies. In Prince Albert National Park, bison were more closely associated with the distribution of plants that maximized their instantaneous energy intake rate (IDE) than their daily intake of digestible energy. This result reflected both bison's intensity of use of individual meadows and their selection of foraging sites within meadows. On this basis, we tested whether IDE could explain the spatial dynamics of bison reintroduced to Grasslands National Park. As predicted, bison distribution in this park best matched spatial patterns of plants offering rapid IDE rather than rapid sodium intake, phosphorus intake, or daily intake of digestible energy. Because the two study areas have very different plant communities, a phenomenological model of resource selection developed in one area could not be used to predict animal distribution in the other. We were able, however, to successfully infer the distribution of bison from their foraging objective.

However, plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions.

They are connected with wind and climatic conditions, the location of the power plant, as well as those associated with the power plant itself. The basic parameter of wind energy is the velocity of flowing air, whose variation is very high. As a result, permanent changes in power and wind energy amounts occur, which was shown in the paper on the basis of selected locations in Poland and Netherlands. The methodology of ""Wind Atlas"", elaborated by RISO in 1989 and being currently the world standard, is used to evaluate wind energy resources. In this methodology, the Weibull distribution function is applied to describe the distribution of wind velocity, whose parameters are calculated on the basis of empiric data, with the moments method as the method of approximation. This is, however, a possible source of errors, which are then included in the produced amount of energy. It is crucial, then, to apply the proper approximation methods and to know the possible occurring errors. The measurement of the wind velocity should be very precise, because even a small error like 5% in evaluation of wind velocity produces about a 16% miscalculation in the forecasting of the total amount of energy produced. Three methods of Weibull distribution function approximation for wind velocity were presented in the paper: the least square method, the maximum likelihood method and the moments method. The given results were verified and the impact of the applied approximation methods on the preciseness of the produced wind velocity distribution function, as well its statistical parameters and energetic resources, was evaluated.",,,,"Niedoba, Tomasz/E-9747-2016","Niedoba, Tomasz/0000-0002-8426-0269",,,,,0,0,0,4,,,,,,978-1-84564-510-6,SEARCH I SER DEV ATT,,,2011,,,,,,,403,+,,10.2495/ECO110351,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,,,WOS:000298911600036,,,,,

We downscaled temperatures for the Fraser River, British Columbia to evaluate the impact of climate warming on the frequency of exceeding thermal thresholds associated with salmon migratory success. Alarmingly, a modest 1.0 degrees C increase in average summer water temperature over 100 years (1981-2000 to 2081-2100) tripled the number of days per year exceeding critical salmonid thermal thresholds (i.e. 19.0 degrees C). Refined thresholds for two populations (Gates Creek and Weaver Creek) of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were defined using physiological constraint models based on aerobic scope. While extreme temperatures leading to complete aerobic collapse remained unlikely under our warming scenario, both populations were increasingly forced to migrate upriver at reduced levels of aerobic performance (e.g. in 80% of future simulations, >= 90% of salmon encountered temperatures exceeding population-specific thermal optima for maximum aerobic scope; T-opt=16.3 degrees C for Gates Creek and T-opt=14.5 degrees C for Weaver Creek). Assuming recent changes to river entry timing persist, we also predicted dramatic increases in the probability of freshwater mortality for Weaver Creek salmon due to reductions in aerobic, and general physiological, performance (e.g. in 42% of future simulations >= 50% of Weaver Creek fish exceeded temperature thresholds associated with 0-60% of maximum aerobic scope). Potential for adaptation via directional selection on run-timing was more evident for the Weaver Creek population. Early entry Weaver Creek fish experienced 25% (range: 15-31%) more suboptimal temperatures than late entrants, compared with an 8% difference (range: 0-17%) between early and late Gates Creek fish.

However, while many environmental parameters are known to individually influence zooplankton diversity and taxonomic composition, relatively little is known of the hierarchical relationships among potential controls or of how regulatory mechanisms may change in response to climate variation on diverse scales. To address these issues, we surveyed 70 lakes within a 100 000 km2 prairie region to simulate the magnitude of environmental change expected to occur over 100-1000 years and to quantify the unique and interactive effects of diverse environmental parameters in regulating pelagic invertebrate community structure at that scale. Multivariate analyses showed that salinity was the principal correlate of changes in invertebrate composition among lakes, with a sequential loss of taxa between salinities of 4 and 50 g total dissolved solids L-1 until one to two species predominated in highly saline systems. In contrast, changes in the concentrations of Ca2+ and other mineral nutrients exerted secondary controls of invertebrate assemblages independent of salinity, whereas lake depth provided a tertiary regulatory mechanism structuring species composition. In contrast to these large-scale hierarchical patterns, seasonal surveys (May, July, September) of a subset of 21 lakes in each of 2003-2005 revealed that annual meteorological variation had no measurable effect on pelagic invertebrates, despite large differences in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation arising from regional droughts. Together these findings show that pelagic invertebrate communities in saline lakes are resilient to interannual variability in climate, but suggest that lakes of the northern Great Plains may provide a sensitive model to forecast centennial effects of future climate change.",,,,"Leavitt, Peter R./A-1048-2013","Leavitt, Peter R./0000-0001-9805-9307",NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Prairie Adaptation Research Collaborative (PARC); Province of Saskatchewan; University of Regina,"This research was funded by NSERC Canada, Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Canada Research Chair Program, the Prairie Adaptation Research Collaborative (PARC), the Province of Saskatchewan, and the University of Regina.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Euonymus europaeus that are relevant to understand its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Euonymus europaeus (Spindle tree) is a native gynodioecious deciduous shrub whose distribution is mostly associated with fertile soil at higher pH values. It is frequently found in hedgerows and woodland edges but also in woodland as an understorey shrub, often with Fraxinus excelsior, Acer campestre and Quercus species, and in open scrub over limestone with Cornus sanguinea. Its seed is widely dispersed by birds and rodents. 3. Euonymus europaeus is winter hardy and shade tolerant and, when young, its green shoots with stomata fix c. 15% of its CO2. The aril is eaten by a range of animals but the seeds are poisonous and the whole plant contains compounds of medicinal and veterinary value. 4. Euonymus europaeus acts as the winter host to two important crop pests: the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) which feeds on field beans (Vicia faba) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), and the peach potato aphid/green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) a widespread pest of a large number of crops. Despite removal of E. europaeus from hedgerows and woodlands in the past, its present populations appear stable.",,,,,,,,,,5,7,3,53,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Some studies have assessed the effect of such changes on biodiversity, but most of these were diachronic studies of population dynamics, or synchronic studies of species habitat selection, whereas few studies have simultaneously taken into account temporal changes in habitat composition and changes in species distribution. This study analysed the effects of land-use changes on the distribution of wild ungulates (Capreolus capreolus, Capra pyrenaica, Cervus elaphus and Sus scrofa). Using favourability function and Markov chain analysis combined with cellular automata, we addressed the following objectives: (i) to examine the environmental determinants of ungulate distribution in the past (1960s) and present (1990s), (ii) to model land use for 2040 to forecast future species distributions and (iii) to assess the biogeographical differences between the above-mentioned study periods (past-present and present-future). Species favourability was predicted to be more widely distributed in the present than in the past, but this increase varied across species. Areas predicted to be favourable in the present should remain stable in the future, but in addition there will be more new favourable areas not previously occupied by these species.

Today, the 'economy of restoration' (conservation) is spreading quickly, promoting a new dimension in the use of basic information and database management. This 'economy of restoration' promotes revitalization of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, representing a signifi cant conceptual advance. For more effective management, the predictive power of limnology is used to anticipate impacts or to mitigate them. In addition, management is integrated (multiple uses considered) with a holistic vision (drainage basin as a unit). The management of rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetland areas, and water resources needs to integrate two approaches that complement each other: for the quality and the quantity of surface water and groundwater. Several techniques exist for the restoration and management of water basins, rivers, lakes and reservoirs. These techniques differ in costs, depending on the extent of restoration or conservation and the existing impacts. In addition to describing the various techniques, examples are presented of the implementation of actions of restoration and management in several natural and artificial systems (reservoirs).

This study focuses on testing the predictions made 10 yr ago concerning the evolution of a mangrove forest in Galle-Unawatuna, Sri Lanka. The very high resolution (VHR) ground inventory revealed that the adult mangrove species composition is dominated by Rhizophora apiculata, Excoecaria agallocha, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula, with a total density of 216 to 267 stems 0.1 ha(-1) and a basal area of 1.19 to 1.44 m(2) 0.1 ha(-1). However, both young and juvenile vegetation in most sectors were dominated solely by B. gymnorrhiza (128 to 869 stems and 356 to 1482 propagules 0.1 ha(-1)). The recent decadal changes between 1994 and 2004 observed through IKONOS imagery and ground truthing confirmed many of the predictions and showed dynamic shifts in young/adult vegetation of B. gymnorrhiza. Although dominance of R. apiculata and E. agallocha has been seen to alternate over decades (1956 to 2004), the emerging growth of B. gymnorrhiza might cause yet another transition of this mangrove area into a Bruguiera-dominated forest in the near future, resulting in the conclusion that the 'moving mosaic' pattern of mangrove species distribution at Galle-Unawatuna still persists. We maintain that this mangrove forest is probably one of the most dynamic in the world in terms of species turnover. To our knowledge, the present study represents one of the few long-term field-based monitoring research projects on mangroves using VHR remote sensing and VHR fieldwork at decadal intervals, and is probably the only study testing forest development predictions made in the past.",,,,"Cannicci, Stefano/L-7136-2015; Behara, Satyanarayana/F-7694-2013; Cannicci, Stefano/N-8512-2019","Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; Behara, Satyanarayana/0000-0003-4191-2607",Belgian National Science Foundation (FNRS)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [FP7-247514],"B.S. is supported by the Belgian National Science Foundation (FNRS).

We compared historical (1969-1971) and contemporary (2005-2009) abundances of species in the marine epibenthic community of Bodega Harbor, California, USA. Between these 2 time periods, we found a decrease in the abundance of native species and an increase in non-native dominance, including of several species that were either rare or absent similar to 35 yr ago and whose introduction was likely human-mediated. This compositional shift was concurrent with an increase in local water temperature of similar to 1 degrees C over the same interval. To address the potential role of ocean warming in facilitating the increase of the new dominant species and maintaining compositional shifts, we evaluated the correlation between temperature and recruitment for 15 species. We found that recruitment timing and magnitude were positively related to temperature for non-native species but not for native species overall. Combined with previous results suggesting effects of ocean warming on the relative performance of native vs. non-native species in this community, our study indicates the potential for continued dominance of non-native species in Bodega Harbor due to local temperature increases. Simultaneously, anthropogenic transport has been responsible for several recent introductions of competitively dominant species, and shifts in contaminant loads or other factors between the 2 time periods could also contribute to compositional shifts, both historically and in the future. Our results highlight the need for studies of these additional factors, as well as the mechanisms underlying their effects on compositional shifts, in order to predict future changes.",,,,,,AAUW; California Ocean Protection Council; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0114432],"We especially thank M.

Since the early 1990s, the landscape ecology approach has been applied in several coastal subtidal and intertidal biogenic habitats across a range of spatial scales. Emerging evidence indicates that animals in these seascapes respond to the structure of patches and patch mosaics in different ways and at different spatial scales, yet we still know very little about the ecological significance of these relationships and the consequences of change in seascape patterning for ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity. Ecological interactions that occur within patches and among different types of patches (or seascapes) are likely to be critically important in maintaining primary and secondary production, trophic transfer, biodiversity, coastal protection, and supporting a wealth of ecosystem goods and services. We review faunal responses to patch and seascape structure, including effects of fragmentation on 5 focal habitats: seagrass meadows, salt marshes, coral reefs, mangrove forests, and oyster reefs. Extrapolating and generalizing spatial relationships between ecological patterns and processes across scales remains a significant challenge, and we show that there are major gaps in our understanding of these relationships. Filling these gaps will be crucial for managing and responding to an inevitably changing coastal environment. We show that critical ecological thresholds exist in the structural patterning of biogenic ecosystems that, when exceeded, cause abrupt shifts in the distribution and abundance of organisms. A better understanding of faunal-seascape relationships, including the identifications of threshold effects, is urgently needed to support the development of more effective and holistic management actions in restoration, site prioritization, and forecasting the impacts of environmental change.",,,,,"Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",Abo Akademi University Endowment; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); NOAA Biogeography BranchNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"The Research Institute of the Abo Akademi University Endowment is acknowledged for providing financial support to C.

Such differences become extremely important during the early life stages, since these are the most critical phases in woody-species recruitment, they depend heavily on resources, and they may determine future community composition. Under a global-change scenario, where climatic conditions, nutrient availability, and habitat characteristics are expected to be altered, it is difficult to predict the way in which plant recruitment will be affected. To understand the impact of different global-change drivers on community recruitment, we sowed a set of species representative of the different successional groups of a complete Mediterranean woody community under field conditions, and studied their emergence, growth, and survival along the main resource gradients of light, water, and nutrients. The light and nutrient gradients followed the natural range of conditions in the study area, but water availability was manipulated to simulate three contrasting climatic scenarios: wetter, drier, and current conditions. Structural equation modelling was used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors and relations governing plant recruitment. Overall, seedling emergence was determined directly by light; growth was determined by light and summer soil moisture; and survival was determined by summer soil moisture. Light was the main factor indirectly affecting the demographic stages of all species. However, the magnitude of the direct and indirect relationships varied among species. Particularly, species differed in their response to the expected drier climatic conditions, some (e.g. Pinus sylvestris, Acer opalus) being much more vulnerable than others (e.g. Cytisus scoparius, Salvia lavandulifolia). These differential responses could translate as major shifts in the structure of the overall plant community. Our results support the idea that the analysis of complex relations among essential resources is critical for accurate forecasts of the impact of climate change on community dynamics.

All these products reveal a similar pattern in the averaged flux fields. The zonal mean LHF fields all exhibit a continuous increase equatorward. With an exception of HOAPS-3, the zonal mean SHF fields display a minimum value near 50 degrees S, increasing both pole -and equatorward. The differences in the standard deviation for LHF are larger among the six data products than the differences for SHF. Over the regions where the surface fluxes are significantly influenced by the Antarctic Oscillation and the Pacific-South American teleconnection, the values and distributions of both LHF and SHF are consistent among the six products.

This study simulated the carbon cycles under these changes using process-based ecosystem models. The Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM), was used to evaluate the impacts of climate change and CO, fertilization on net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and the vegetation structure of terrestrial ecosystems in Zhejiang province (area 101,800 Km(2), mainly covered by subtropical evergreen forest and warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf forest) which is located in the subtropical climate area of China. Two general circulation models (HADCM3 and CGCM3) representing four IPCC climate change scenarios (HC3AA, HC3GG, CGCM-srcsa2, and CGCM-sresb1) were used as climate inputs for IBIS. Results show that simulated historical bio-mass and NPP are consistent with field and other modelled data, which makes the analysis of future carbon budget reliable. The results indicate that NPP over the entire Zhejiang province was about 55 Mt C yr(-1) during the last half of the 21(st) century. An NPP increase of about 24 Mt C by the end of the 21(st) century was estimated with the combined effects of increasing CO2 and climate change. A slight NPP increase of about 5 Mt C was estimated under the climate change alone scenario. Forests in Zhejiang are currently acting as a carbon sink with an average NEP of about 2.5 Mt C yr(-1). NEP will increase to about 5 Mt C yr(-1) by the end of the 21(st) century with the increasing atmospheric CO, concentration and climate change. However, climate change alone will reduce the forest carbon sequestration of Zhejiang's forests. Future climate warming will substantially change the vegetation cover types; warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf forest will be gradually substituted by subtropical evergreen forest. An increasing CO2 concentration will have little contribution to vegetation changes. Simulated NPP shows geographic patterns consistent with temperature to a certain extent, and precipitation is not the limiting factor for forest NPP in the subtropical climate conditions. There is no close relationship between the spatial pattern of NEP and climate condition.",,,,"Liu, Jinxun/H-8604-2018; Peng, Changhui/G-8248-2012","Liu, Jinxun/0000-0003-0561-8988; Wei, Xiaohua (Adam)/0000-0003-2711-5636","State Key Fundamental Science Funds of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2005CB422207]; NSF-ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40671132]; State International Cooperation Project [200831810]; State Data Synthesis and Analysis Funds of China [2006DKA32300-08, 2007FY110300-08]; Zhejiang Provincial Top-key Discipline of Silvilculture [200608]","Funding support partially from The State Key Fundamental Science Funds of China (2005CB422207), NSF-China Project (40671132), State International Cooperation Project (200831810)and The State Data Synthesis and Analysis Funds of China (2006DKA32300-08, 2007FY110300-08), and the Open Fund for a Zhejiang Provincial Top-key Discipline of Silvilculture (No. 200608).",,,8,8,2,23,,,,1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

Commonvoles (Microtus arvalis) are the most common vertebrate pests in central European agriculture. During outbreaks common vole populations can increase to an enormous number of individuals; however, this outbreak risk varies regionally. Aims. In this study we tested whether topography and soil properties are suited to explain the regional variability in the outbreak risk of the common vole in Eastern Germany. This study provides the first detailed large-scale study of the association of site characteristics and small mammal outbreak risk at a regional scale. Methods. Data oncommonvole outbreaks were recorded by active burrow counts at 82 sampling sites in Eastern Germany from almost four decades. Data on topography and soil properties - i.e. groundwater fluctuation index, soil air capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil class and elevation - were obtained from soil maps and a digital elevation model in a geographic information system and were related to outbreak risk classes, applying classification and regression trees (CART). Based on these results a map of the outbreak risk was developed for the area. Key results. Classification and regression tree analyses revealed that the mean elevation, area-related percentage of Chernozem soils and soil air capacity were the site characteristics best suited to explain local variability in outbreak risk. In the northern German lowland, below an elevation of similar to 83m above sea level, the outbreak risk is generally very low. The region of the central upland has an increased risk for outbreaks of common voles. Within the region of the central uplands the risk was again elevated if the area covered by Chernozem soils was higher than 36%, and increased further if the area covered by soils with a moderate soil air capacity was higher than 90%. Conclusions. Topography and soil properties, and accordingly the character of a landscape, are static parameters that affect the local risk of common vole outbreak. Further detailed field investigations of soil properties are required to link the variation in regional outbreak risk to site characteristics with relevance to common vole ecology. Implications. Areas of varying regional outbreak risk of common voles can be defined according to static site characteristics identified in this study. They can provide a spatial framework to relate dynamic parameters, such as meteorological parameters, as well as biological parameters, such as food availability, to common vole outbreaks. This could be used in the future to develop improved predictive models to forecast common vole outbreaks.",,,,"Jacob, Jens/C-2189-2013","Jacob, Jens/0000-0002-5136-6606","German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection [28-1-42.030-6]","We are grateful to the plant protection agencies of the former German Democratic Republic and their successors in the present-day German states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia for conducting active burrow counts for many years.

Common vole (Microtus arvalis) populations can increase to several thousand individuals per hectare during outbreaks. In central Europe such outbreaks usually extend across large areas but there can be significant regional differences in outbreak intensity, general outbreak risk and associated crop damage. Aims. We tested whether weather parameters can be used to explain the regional variability in outbreak risk of common voles in an area of Eastern Germany where common vole outbreaks are common. Method. Suitable weather parameters were identified by principal component analysis (PCA). Time series of common vole abundance from 50 locations across 36 500 km(2) sampled in 1973-97 were related to weather parameters selected by PCA and multiple linear regression. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used on relevant weather parameters to display the temporal and spatial variability in vole abundance. An overlay of risk class transformed abundances allowed for the identification of appropriate threshold values to define vole outbreaks. Key results. Weather parameters were closely related to the variation in regional outbreak risk of common voles. Mostly weather parameters in winter and early spring were identified to be highly important. All risk thresholds tested revealed similar patterns for the distribution of risk classes across locations and years. While most years of very low or very high outbreak risk clustered well according to weather parameters, some cases of medium risk classes did not cluster well. Conclusions. Weather parameters especially in winter and early spring are related to common vole outbreak risk in the following autumn. This is the case for extremely high and low outbreak risks and is largely independent of the choice of particular threshold values for outbreak risk. Implications. Weather parameters could be used to develop automated forecast systems at the spatial resolution of single weather stations. Combined with other parameters that are easily available, such as information on soil characteristics, such forecasts might be as reliable as more complex biological models developed in the past.",,,,"Jacob, Jens/C-2189-2013","Jacob, Jens/0000-0002-5136-6606","German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection [28-1-42.030-6]","We thank T.

The Crop Microclimate Simulation Model of Goudriaan was applied in our study. The expected weather, plant and soil modifications were based on long-term observations during the time period 1961-1990 in the Keszthely area (Hungary. N 46 degrees 44', E 17 degrees 14'; altitude 112 m). Besides application of the A2 and B2 SRES scenarios, the impact of extreme hot days was also included in the study. This was necessary as these events have recently occurred more and more frequently. Demonstration of weather scenarios with relatively high warming rates was made possible by the high resolution of the model, simulating even daily changes. The stomatal resistance significantly increased in all scenarios, as was indeed experienced in the last decade (1997-2006). A twofold increase in CO2 concentration approximately halves stomatal openings even under unchanged weather conditions. This can be considered as an advantageous side effect of the global climate change on the plant's water balance, important in continental climate because of scarce precipitation. In Scenarios A2 and B2, increases in resistance were close to the effect of doubled CO2 concentration. Surprisingly, the effect of an increase in the number of extreme hot days on stomatal resistance was moderate, below than what might have been expected. The common impact of the environmental and biological factors on stomatal resistance was realized using normalized leaf area indices, where the highest increases were predicted by using the hottest and driest scenario. Moderate changes in water loss and photosynthesis indicated a certain amount of available soil moisture reserve even in the extreme weather situations in July, at Keszthely. Decrease in carbon assimilation can occur in days with extreme temperatures. Our scenarios do not include significant precipitation decline because of forecast uncertainties. A significant precipitation decrease would fundamentally reshape our results, so we do not propose to extend our conclusions in the case of significant modification in rainfall amount or distribution.

Such activities may circumvent biogeographic factors, with considerable ecological, evolutionary, and economic implications. However, the efficacy of predictions concerning community changes following inter-basin movements are limited, often because the dispersal mechanism is poorly understood (e.g., quantified only partially). To date, spatial-interaction models that predict the movement of humans as vectors of biotic transfer have not incorporated patterns of human movement through transportation networks. As a necessary first step to determine the role of anglers as invasion vectors across a land-lake ecosystem, we investigate their movement potential within Ontario, Canada. To determine possible model improvements resulting from inclusion of network travel, spatial-interaction models were constructed using standard Euclidean (e.g., straight-line) distance measures and also with distances derived from least-cost routing of human transportation networks. Model comparisons determined that least-cost routing both provided the most parsimonious model and also excelled at forecasting spatial interactions, with a proportion of 0.477 total movement deviance explained. The distribution of movements was characterized by many relatively short to medium travel distances (median = 292.6 km) with fewer lengthier distances (75th percentile = 484.6 km, 95th percentile = 775.2 km); however, even the shortest movements were sufficient to overcome drainage-basin boundaries. Ranking of variables in order of their contribution within the most parsimonious model determined that distance traveled, origin outflow, lake attractiveness, and sportfish richness significantly influence movement patterns. Model improvements associated with least-cost routing of human transportation networks imply that patterns of human-mediated invasion are fundamentally linked to the spatial configuration and relative impedance of human transportation networks, placing increased importance on understanding their contribution to the invasion process.",,,,,,University of TorontoUniversity of Toronto; Ontario Graduate ScholarshipOntario Graduate Scholarship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Center of Expertise for Aquatic Risk Assessment; NSERC Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters,"We thank H.

Overabundant wildlife can cause economic and ecological damage. Therefore population control typically seeks to maintain species' abundance within desired control limits. Efficient control requires targets, methods for estimating population size before and after control, and reliable means of forecasting population size. Demographic stochasticity, environmental variability and model uncertainty complicate these tasks. Monitoring provides critical feedback in the control process, yet examples of integrated monitoring and management are scarce. 2. We developed an integrated Bayesian population modelling and monitoring algorithm to assist with dynamic cull control of an overabundant population. We describe components of the control algorithm and their combination to produce a structured, sequential prescription for implementing control of a kangaroo population. We demonstrate its application within a single management year and evaluate its performance over a multi-year horizon under a range of scenarios reflecting uncertainties about population dynamics. 3. Simulation testing of the algorithm demonstrates that it provides a coherent, flexible, efficient and robust basis for managing population control. It is coherent in that connections between management objectives, models and operating rules are explicit and logically integrated. It is flexible in that the management objectives can be freely varied. It is both cost and operationally efficient because: (i) it avoids the need for an expensive, dedicated sampling process to estimate population size prior to culling; (ii) a relatively small number of culls produces reasonable population size estimates and (iii) the estimation by removal process enables direct assessment of whether control has been achieved. Lastly, it is robust because even when there is substantial uncertainty about system state and dynamics, the algorithm performs well at keeping the population under control over the duration of the management horizon. 4. Synthesis and applications. We provide a general and flexible framework for integrated monitoring and culling when the objective is to keep a species' abundance within control limits. Our framework explicitly deals with uncertainty arising from demographic stochasticity, ecological complexity and lack of knowledge, and provides the foundation for maximizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness of control operations. Our approach could be applied in any instances where control is effected via culling.",,,,"Chee, Yung En/H-9391-2019","Chee, Yung En/0000-0002-8478-373X; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950","ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [LP0667891]; Applied Environmental Decision Analysis CERF (Australian Government Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts); Parks Victoria's Research Partners Program","This work was funded by Parks Victoria's Research Partners Program.

The values of ET0 derived using these three methods were compared to those estimated using the reference FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) method under semi-arid conditions of the Tensift basin (central of Morocco) and the Yaqui Valley (Northwest Mexico). The results showed that the HARG method is the best one to estimate ET0 over both semi-and test sites. Conversely, the performance of the other two empirical methods was poor except under humid conditions. However when the parameters alpha and C-m figurate in the PT and Mak equations are locally calibrated, the performance of these two methods greatly improved. Additionally, this study showed that, when measurements of meteorological parameters needed for estimating ET0 (which are not always available especially in developing countries) are lacking, the climatic data generated with numerical weather prediction models provide an alternative and effective solution to estimate ET0.

Characterizing benthic species by biological attributes (traits) that are responsive to temperature and streamflow conditions can support a mechanistic approach for assessing the potential ecological responses to climate change. However, nonclimatic environmental factors also structure benthic communities and may mitigate transient climatic conditions, and these must be considered in evaluating potential impacts of climate change. Here we used macroinvertebrate and environmental data for 279 reference-quality sites spanning 12 states in the western US. For each sampling location, we described 45 environmental variables that spanned reach to catchment scales and that represented contemporary climate drivers, hydrologic metrics, and nonclimatic habitat features, as well as purely spatial metrics. We described benthic community composition at each site in terms of 7 species traits, including those considered sensitive to temperature increases and streamflow changes. All combined environmental variables explained 67% of the total trait variation across the sites, and catchment-scale climatic and hydrologic variables independently accounted for 19%. Sites were clustered into 3 community types based on trait composition, and a classification-tree analysis confirmed that climatic and hydrologic variables were important in partitioning these groups. Sensitivity of benthic communities to projected climate change was assessed by quantifying the proportion of taxa at sites having the traits of either cold stenothermy or obligate rheophily. Regression-tree analysis showed that temperature and hydrologic variables mostly accounted for the differences in proportion of sensitivity traits across the sites. We examined the vulnerability of sites to climate change by superimposing regional-scale projections of late-21(st)-century temperature and runoff change on the spatial distribution of temperature- and runoff-sensitive assemblages. Sites with high proportions of cold stenotherms and obligate rheophiles occur throughout the western US, but the degree of temperature and runoff change is projected to be greatest for reference sites in the Upper Colorado River and Great Basin. Thus, our results suggest that traits-based sensitivity coupled with intraregional variation in projected changes in temperature and runoff will cause reference sites in the western US to be differentially vulnerable to future climate change.",,,,"Pyne, Matthew/F-6910-2011","Poff, N LeRoy/0000-0002-1390-8742; Pyne, Matthew/0000-0002-4236-8749","USEPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [SPO BS0056363, R833833]","We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel data set.

Datasets on rare species distribution usually have few observations, limited spatial accuracy and lack of valid absences; conversely they provide comprehensive views of species distributions allowing to realistically capture most of their realized environmental niche. Rare species are the most in need of predictive distribution modelling but also the most difficult to model. We refer to this contrast as the ""rare species modelling paradox"" and propose as a solution developing modelling approaches that deal with a sufficiently large set of predictors, ensuring that statistical models are not over-fitted. Our novel approach fulfils this condition by fitting a large number of bivariate models and averaging them with a weighted ensemble approach. We further propose that this ensemble forecasting is conducted within a hierarchic multi-scale framework. We present two ensemble models for a test species, one at regional and one at local scale, each based on the combination of 630 models. In both cases, we obtained excellent spatial projections, unusual when modelling rare species. Model results highlight, from a statistically sound approach, the effects of multiple drivers in a same modelling framework and at two distinct scales. From this added information, regional models can support accurate forecasts of range dynamics under climate change scenarios, whereas local models allow the assessment of isolated or synergistic impacts of changes in multiple predictors. This novel framework provides a baseline for adaptive conservation, management and monitoring of rare species at distinct spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate the combined modelling approach with a case study investigating increases in woody vegetation density in northern Australia's tropical savannas. We found that by utilising the strengths of a simulation model and a Bayesian network we could both forecast future change in woody vegetation density and diagnose the reasons for current vegetation states. The local conditions of climate, soil characteristics and the starting population of trees were found to be more important in explaining the likelihood of change in woody vegetation density compared to management practices such as grazing pressure and fire regimes. We conclude that combining the strengths of a process and BN model allowed us to produce a simple model that utilised the ability of the process model to simulate ecosystem processes in detail and over long time periods, and the ability of the BN to capture uncertainty in ecosystem response and to conduct scenario, sensitivity and diagnostic analysis. The overall result was a model that has the potential to provide land managers with a better understanding of the behaviour of a complex ecosystem than simply utilising either modelling approach in isolation.

The total in-use aluminum stock in 2007 is estimated as 93 million metric tons, which represents approximately 34% of the cumulative apparent consumption since 1900. Alternately, since 1900 nearly 40% of the cumulative discarded aluminum has not been recycled for domestic use in the U.S. or for export to foreign consumers. Statistical time series analysis is used to explore the relationship between model results of in-use stocks and gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike most previous studies of material consumption and economic activity, which ignore the statistical properties of time series data to the detriment of model estimation and inference, data stationarity is explicitly evaluated through unit root testing and model specification is adjusted accordingly. The annual percentage change in GDP is found to have a large and significant association with the annual percentage change in net additions to in-use stocks. Model sensitivity and uncertainty are quantified through the application of the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test and alternate specifications of product lifetime probability density functions.

When studying the species richness with such modeling methods, the extent of the study range is of particular importance, especially when the full range of occurrence is not considered for some species, often because of geographical or political limits. Here we examine biases induced by the use of range-restricted occurrence data on predicted changes in species richness and predicted extinction rates, at study area margins. We compared projections of future suitable climate space for 179 bird species breeding in Iberia and North Africa (27 of them breeding only in North Africa though potential colonizers in Europe), using occurrence data from the full Western Palaearctic (WP) species range and from the often-considered European-restricted range. Current and future suitable climatic spaces were modeled using an ensemble forecast technique applied to five general circulation models and three climate scenarios, with eight climatic variables and eight modeling techniques. The use of range-restricted compared to the full WP occurrence data of a species led to an underestimate of its suitable climatic space. The projected changes in species richness across the focus area (Iberia) varied considerably according to the occurrence data we used, with higher local extinction rates with European-restricted data (on average 38 vs 12% for WP data). Modeling results for species currently breeding only in North Africa revealed potential colonization of the Iberian Peninsula (from a climatic point of view), which highlights the necessity to consider species outside the focus area if interested in forecasted changes in species richness. Therefore, the modeling of current and future species richness can lead to misleading conclusions when data from a restricted range of occurrence is used. Consequently, climate suitability models should use occurrence data from the complete distribution range of species, or at least within biogeographical areas.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274",EUEuropean Union (EU) [066866],"We thank the EBCC for the access to the atlas data.

Fishing may be an important evolutionary force that can change the distribution of fitness-related traits; however, the magnitude and direction of the evolutionary response may be influenced by different management strategies. Most phenotypic traits subject to human-induced selection are simultaneously influenced by the environment and by genetic variation, and many traits are genetically correlated. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary outcomes of harvest activities on mean length and age at maturity in a fish population by coupling a multivariate quantitative genetic model with a Leslie life history matrix model. Lengths-at-ages were treated as genetically correlated characters parameterized from empirical data on chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations. Using simulations, we explored the outcomes of 100 years of harvest using gill nets, which impose disruptive selection, or longlines, which impose minimum size selection, that targeted immature individuals in the high seas or maturing individuals in terminal spawning areas. Response in mean length and age depended on selection differentials imposed by harvest (which depended in turn on fishing location, gear type, and proportion of the population harvested) and on the genetic correlations between traits. Mean length was strongly influenced by the selection differential of the most abundant age class. Large differences in response were observed between the high-seas fishery, where the most abundant age was the youngest age vulnerable to harvest, compared to the terminal area fishery, where an older age class was most abundant. We observed a substantial difference in response between gill nets and longlines in the terminal fishery only. The evolution of mean age of mature individuals was less predictable, but generally increased as length decreased and decreased as length increased. The model presented here has potential for incorporating empirical data into fisheries forecasting and therefore provides a powerful means of integrating evolutionary considerations into harvest management.",,,,"Naish, Kerry/F-5768-2014","Naish, Kerry/0000-0002-3275-8778","National Sea Grant/National Marine Fisheries Service; National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA05OAR41711742, E/I-11]","The authors thank Michelle McClure, Fred Utter, and two anonymous reviewers for providing valuable advice on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Candidate statistical models allowed vital rates to vary with time and as functions of a sea ice covariate. Model averaging was used to produce the vital rate estimates, and a parametric bootstrap procedure was used to quantify model selection and parameter estimation uncertainty. Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001-2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004-2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in lambda in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log lambda(s) approximate to -0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with ""business as usual"" (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting stochastic population projections showed drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. These projections were instrumental in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U. S.

There is increasing evidence suggesting that, in addition to other environmental factors, climate change is affecting species distributions and local population dynamics. Additionally, as a consequence of the growing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the oceans are taking up increasing amounts of this CO2, causing ocean pH to decrease (ocean acidification). The relative impacts of ocean acidification on population dynamics have yet to be investigated, despite many studies indicating that there will be at least a sublethal impact on many marine organisms, particularly key calcifying organisms. Using empirical data, we forced a barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) population model to investigate the relative influence of sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification on a population nearing the southern limit of its geographic distribution. Hindcast models were compared to observational data from Cellar Beach (southwestern United Kingdom). Results indicate that a declining pH trend (-0.0017 unit/yr), indicative of ocean acidification over the past 50 years, does not cause an observable impact on the population abundance relative to changes caused by fluctuations in temperature. Below the critical temperature (here T-crit = 13.1 degrees C), pH has a more significant affect on population dynamics at this southern range edge. However, above this value, SST has the overriding influence. At lower SST, a decrease in pH (according to the National Bureau of Standards, pH(NBS)) from 8.2 to 7.8 can significantly decrease the population abundance. The lethal impacts of ocean acidification observed in experiments on early life stages reduce cumulative survival by similar to 25%, which again will significantly alter the population level at this southern limit. Furthermore, forecast predictions from this model suggest that combined acidification and warming cause this local population to die out 10 years earlier than would occur if there was only global warming and no concomitant decrease in pH.",,,,"Burrows, Michael T/D-9844-2013","Burrows, Michael T/0000-0003-4620-5899",NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/S/A/2006/14324],"H.

Transmitted data were obtained from seven tags. An eighth tag was recovered and provided a highly detailed four-month dataset from which several recognizable diving patterns emerged. This M. mola spent considerable time at the surface, possibly warming itself. These apparent basking events were punctuated by regular deep dives below the thermocline to depths as great as 600 m and temperatures as low as 2 degrees C. The vast majority of dives occurred during the day, with relatively little vertical movement at night. Geolocation estimates were possible between tag and release for five individuals. No large, basin-scale movements were apparent with most molas remaining relatively close to their initial tagging location over a six to nine month period. Seasonal movements were apparent for some molas and corresponded to regional shifts in oceanography. Northward movements from the Kuroshio Current into the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Oyashio Current during the summer months coincided with an increase in temperature and reduction in chlorophyll a concentrations in waters near central Japan. In the fall, most molas returned inshore to the coast of Japan. Molas are targeted and incidentally captured by fishermen in these waters, and the information presented here is vital for effective fisheries management and to forecast changes in mola behaviors associated with environmental variability.

Recent catastrophic shifts in Everglades landscape pattern and ecological function highlight the need to understand the feedbacks governing these ecosystems. We modeled feedback between vegetation, hydrology, and sediment transport on the basis of a decade of experimentation. Results from more than 100 simulations showed that flows just sufficient to redistribute sediment from sparsely vegetated sloughs to dense ridges were needed for an equilibrium patterned landscape oriented parallel to flow. Surprisingly, although vegetation heterogeneity typically conveys resilience, in wetlands governed by flow/sediment feedbacks it indicates metastability, whereby the landscape is prone to catastrophic shifts. Substantial increases or decreases in flow relative to the equilibrium condition caused an expansion of emergent vegetation and loss of open-water areas that was unlikely to revert upon restoration of the equilibrium hydrology. Understanding these feedbacks is critical in forecasting wetland responses to changing conditions and designing management strategies that optimize ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration or habitat provision. Our model and new sensitivity analysis techniques address these issues and make it newly apparent that simply returning flow to predrainage conditions in the Everglades may not be sufficient to restore historic landscape patterns and processes.",,,,"Harvey, Judson/L-2047-2013","Harvey, Judson/0000-0002-2654-9873",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0636079]; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)United States Geological Survey; National Park Service [F5284-08-0024],"This work was funded by National Science Foundation award EAR-0636079, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Priority Ecosystems Studies Program, the USGS National Research Program, and the National Park Service, through interagency agreement F5284-08-0024.

While these changes have been well-studied in dense hemlock forests in the Northeast, relatively little work is known about the effects of the adelgid at the western edge of the range of eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis. We evaluated the nature and extent of these changes using vegetation assessments coupled with growth simulations. The woody plant community was assessed in three strata (upper, mid- and lower) and was used to predict forest succession. Using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), we then projected the growth of hemlock forests 20 years into the future with and without the effects of the adelgid. In forest simulations lacking adelgid invasion, little change in composition or structure is forecast. In contrast, our projections predict a near complete loss of the hemlock forest type within 20 years of adelgid establishment, with widespread conversion to hardwood forest types, most notably white oak-red oak-hickory, chestnut oak-black oak-scarlet oak, and yellow poplar-white oak-red oak. Hemlock loss will result in denser deciduous forests with thinner canopies and multiple gaps, and significant alterations to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife habitat.",,,,,,USDA Forest Service Southern Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station [09-08-047],"We would like to thank Melanie Antonik, Keith Holmes, Amber Jones, Tommy Kuhlman, Brian Marbert, Aric Payne, and Matt Thomas for their help with vegetation surveys and data entry.

We also assessed whether patterns of grassland response to a combination of climate change treatments could be forecast by ecosystem responses to single climate change drivers. Effects of climate change on aboveground production showed considerable seasonal and interannual variation; April biomass increased in response to both warming and the simultaneous application of warming, summer drought, and CO2 enrichment, whereas October biomass responses were either non-significant or negative depending on the year. Negative impacts of summer drought on production were only observed in combination with a below-average rainfall regime, and showed lagged effects on spring biomass. Elevated CO2 had no significant effect on aboveground biomass during this study. Both warming and the 2080 climate change scenario were associated with a significant advance in flowering time for the dominant grass species studied. However, flowering phenology showed no significant response to either summer drought or elevated CO2.

Not all systems exhibit abrupt nonlinear responses, but the threshold concept is still useful for describing stressor responses or changes in state variables. For example, the minimum detectable negative response is an initiation-of-impact threshold that might allow for planning and management before population-scale change occurs in taxa. An extirpation threshold, which is the point where a system loses a vital component, such as a species or function, also exists. A number of taxon-specific thresholds to landuse change in watersheds have been identified in previous research. We apply these values to make watershed-level and spatially explicit forecasts regarding imperilment and loss of biodiversity in the face of watershed alterations. We show that unchecked development in the Potapsco River watershed of Maryland could result in the loss of nearly 60% of the benthic macroinvertebrate taxa by the time impervious surface cover reaches 15% of the watershed.

Although direct effects of moderately elevated CO2 in sea water may be of little consequence, indirect effects may be profound. For example, lowered pH and calcium carbonate saturation states may influence both deposition and dissolution rates of mineralized skeletons in many marine organisms. The relative impact of elevated CO2 on deposition and dissolution rates are not known for many large-bodied organisms. We therefore tested the effects of increased CO2 levels-those forecast to occur in roughly 100 and 200 years-on both shell deposition rate and shell dissolution rate in a rocky intertidal snail, Nucella lamellosa. Shell weight gain per day in live snails decreased linearly with increasing CO2 levels. However, this trend was paralleled by shell weight loss per day in empty shells, suggesting that these declines in shell weight gain observed in live snails were due to increased dissolution of existing shell material, rather than reduced production of new shell material. Ocean acidification may therefore have a greater effect on shell dissolution than on shell deposition, at least in temperate marine molluscs.",,,,"Palmer, A.

This eventuality will drive fundamental changes in the quantity and nature of energy flows through the human economic system, which probably will be accompanied by economic turmoil, political conflicts, and a high level of social tension. Besides being a geological and economic issue, peak oil is also a fundamental concern as it pertains to ecological systems and conservation because economics is a subsystem of the global ecosystem and changes in human energy-related behaviors can lead to a broad range of effects on natural ecosystems, ranging from overuse to abandonment. As it becomes more difficult to meet energy demands, environmental considerations may be easily superseded. Given the vital importance of ecosystems and ecosystem services in a postpetroleum era, it is crucially important to wisely manage our ecosystems during the transition period to an economy based on little or no use of fossil fuels. Good policies can be formulated through awareness and understanding gained from scenario-based assessments. Presently, most widely used global scenarios of environmental change do not incorporate resource limitation, including those of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Considering the potential magnitude of the effects of peak oil on society and nature, the development of resource-constrained scenarios should be addressed immediately. Ecologists and conservation biologists are in an important position to analyze the situation and provide guidance, yet the topic is noticeably absent from ecological discussions. We urge politicians, corporate chief executives, thought leaders, and citizens to consider this problem seriously because it is likely to develop into one of the key environmental issues of the 21st century.",,,,,"Czucz, Balint/0000-0002-6462-7633",,,,,12,12,0,27,,,,0888-8892,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Wolves Canis lupus recently recolonized the Western Alps through dispersal from the Italian Apennines, representing one of several worldwide examples of large carnivores increasing in highly human-dominated landscapes. Understanding and predicting expansion of this population is important for conservation because of its direct impact on livestock and its high level of societal opposition. 2. We built a predictive, spatially explicit, individual-based model to examine wolf population expansion in this fragmented landscape, and livestock depredation risk. We developed the model based on known demographic processes, social structure, behaviour and habitat selection of wolves collected during a 10-year intensive field study of this wolf population. 3. During model validation, our model accurately described the recolonization process within the Italian Alps, correctly predicting wolf pack locations, pack numbers and wolf population size, between 1999 and 2008. 4. We then projected packs and dispersers over the entire Italian Alps for 2013, 2018 and 2023. We predicted 25 packs (95% CI: 19-32) in 2013, 36 (23-47) in 2018 and 49 (29-68) in 2023. The South-Western Alps were the main source for wolves repopulating the Alps from 1999 to 2008. The source area for further successful dispersers will probably shift to the North-Western Alps after 2008, but the large lakes in the Central Alps will probably act as a spatial barrier slowing the wolf expansion. 5. Using the pack presence forecasts, we estimated spatially explicit wolf depredation risk on livestock, allowing tailored local and regional management actions. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our predictive model is novel because we follow the spatio-temporal dynamics of packs, not just population size, which have substantially different requirements and impacts on wolf-human conflicts than wandering dispersers. Our approach enables prioritization of management efforts, including minimizing livestock depredations, identifying important corridors and barriers, and locating future source populations for successful wolf recolonization of the Alps.",,,,"McIntire, Eliot/F-7995-2011; Marucco, Francesca/J-1609-2012","McIntire, Eliot/0000-0002-6914-8316; Marucco, Francesca/0000-0002-1390-6106","Piemonte Region, Italy; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs","This study was developed within a multi-year wolf project 'Progetto Lupo Piemonte', funded by the Piemonte Region, Italy.

In the Southern Cone, glacial ice was alpine, not polar; major habitats were (and are) oriented N-S, not E-W; and habitable land area actually increased, not decreased, at the height of the last glacial maximum (LGM). Despite these differences, there is evidence for poleward demographic expansion in 10 of the 14 species, and phylogeographic breaks in these are likewise stepped by latitude (and presumably history) rather than by biome.

Management of these impacts on both private and public lands is necessary to ensure species persistence. Such management entails several hallenges: (1) development of a management policy appropriate to the stressors; (2) linking stressor levels to species population attributes; (3) forecasting the effects of alternative management policy decisions on the species, and (4) using adaptive management to adjust the policy in the future. We illustrate how these challenges were addressed under the Etowah Habitat Conservation Plan (Etowah HCP), a management plan for three federally protected fish species in Georgia, USA. The plan involved the creation of a management policy to address the impacts of the greatest stressor, stormwater runoff, as well as other stressors. Models were constructed to link population indices of the three species with a key indicator of stormwater runoff, effective impervious area (EIA). Then, models were applied to projected levels of EIA under full watershed buildout to fine-tune the parameters of the management policy. Forecasting indicated that the most sensitive species, the Etowah darter, was likely to decline by 84% in the absence of the Etowah HCP, but only 23% if the Etowah HCP were implemented. Although there was substantial uncertainty in model predictions, an adaptive management plan was established to incorporate new data and to adjust management policies as necessary.

The model can simulate 11 state variables: dissolved oxygen, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, organic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus, organic phosphorus and four phytoplankton species with zooplankton as a boundary condition. The ecodynamic model was applied to Sihai section of the Beijing urban river system, where serious algal blooms broke out in recent years. The dominant phytoplankton species are Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cryptophyta. Site-specific data on geometry, meteorology, pollution sources, and existing ecosystem parameters were collected and used for model calibration and verification The model results mimic observed trends of water quality and phytoplankton species succession and can be used for forecasting algal blooms as well as assessment of river management measures.

Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.",,,,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Center for the Dynamics and Evolution of the Land Sea Interface at the University of California, Santa Cruz","We thank the staff and volunteers at PRBO Conservation Science for field and logistical support in collecting the auklet data.

We perform an economic analysis of these grazing strategies using a bio-economic multiperiod linear programming model with variable annual forage production and beef prices. We evaluate the economics of conservative versus flexible grazing where stock numbers are adjusted to match forage conditions. The deterministic model estimates that a flexible grazing strategy could nearly double net returns relative to a conservative strategy, but realizing this substantial economic potential means higher production costs, and it depends on a quality climate forecast that is not currently available. Maintaining grazing flexibility was determined to be very important for managing variable forage conditions, and its importance increased with the level of variability. Without annual variation in forage production, over 80% of available forage would optimally be allocated to cow calf production. As forage variability increased to levels observed on the arid rangelands of the western United States, a 50:50 forage allocation between cow calf and yearling enterprises was found to be optimal, but optimal cow numbers decreased over time as dry conditions force herd reductions. As compared to a cow calf ranch only, adding flexible yearling enterprises increased average annual net ranch returns by 14% with conservative stocking and by up to 66% with flexible grazing. Herd expansion beyond a conservative level should occur with yearlings because adjusting cow numbers is too expensive relative to the potential short-term gain, even if forage conditions are known with certainty.",,,,,,New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station,Research was supported by the New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station.,,,48,49,1,14,,,,1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Here, we explore whether the dynamics of the vortex interactions could affect the predictability of propulsive forces. We studied the dynamics of the interactions between a symmetrically and periodically pitching and heaving foil and the vortices in its wake, in a soap-film tunnel. The phase-locked movie sequences reveal that abundant chaotic vortex-wake interactions occur at high Strouhal numbers. These high numbers are representative for the fins and wings of near-hovering animals. The chaotic wake limits the forecast horizon of the corresponding force and moment integrals. By contrast, we find periodic vortex wakes with an unlimited forecast horizon for the lower Strouhal numbers (0.2-0.4) at which many animals cruise.

Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region.

Here we propose a Footprint index for French Guiana, (northern Atlantic coast of South America) which sums up the expected and proven disturbances on biodiversity. The index was developed by superimposing geographical and human data, including human population densities, land use, settlements and camps, mining and forest activities, tracks, roads and rivers. The relevance of the index as a general measure of anthropic impact on large terrestrial fauna was estimated by investigating the structure of the large terrestrial vertebrate assemblages, including primates, large frugivorous birds, rodents and ungulates, in relation to the extent of disturbances. The abundance of large terrestrial fauna was assessed using the line-transect sampling method in 34 forest sites facing different disturbance levels, including hunting, logging and fragmentation, and consequently different footprint scores. A Self Organizing Map was used to combine species abundances and disturbance scores. It allowed us to rank species in accordance to their sensitivity towards disturbances, identifying the response of fauna to different concomitant threats. The index provided correct identification of sites with similar threats which proves it is a relevant estimator of human disturbance. In addition, the richness of animal communities and abundances of several seed dispersers and predators were negatively correlated to the index (e.g. large monkeys and frugivorous birds, r (2) = 0.49, P < 0.0001 and r (2) = 0.48, P < 0.0001, respectively), indicating its reliability in identifying areas where animal communities are disturbed. The index could, therefore, constitute a useful tool to identify areas where ecological processes supported by those species are expected to be disrupted, and where they are already disrupted. Furthermore, the footprint index can deal with lack of field data or with only partially valid information, and so may directly help land managers forecast and, hopefully, mitigate forthcoming impacts resulting from the development of human activities.",,,,"Brosse, Sebastien/AAC-4689-2019","Richard-Hansen, Cecile/0000-0002-9353-791X; Brosse, Sebastien/0000-0002-3659-8177; Winterton, Peter/0000-0002-4647-5648","Office National des Forets, Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage, Direction Regionale de l'Environnement de la Guyane; ""La Valle e des Singes'', France; ""Doue la Fontaine'', France; Nature reserve of La Trinite","Field surveys (BT, CRH) were funded by the Office National des Forets, Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage, Direction Regionale de l'Environnement de la Guyane, zoological parks of ""La Valle e des Singes'', France, ""Doue la Fontaine'', France, Nature reserve of La Trinite.

A risk-based decision model was developed to assess the likelihood of zebra mussel invasion and establishment throughout the St. Croix Basin. The risk-based decision model CASM(ZM) is a version of the comprehensive aquatic systems model (CASM) and that was modified to simulate the growth, reproduction, and spatial distribution of zebra mussels. As a risk management tool, the model simulates the population dynamical complexity of zebra mussel populations, as well as their impacts on phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and natural mussel populations. The CASM(ZM) is based in part on a set of zebra mussel's physical-chemical habitat requirements such as calcium concentration (17 mg/L), total hardness (57.5 mg/L), conductivity (62 mu S/cm), dissolved oxygen concentration (6 mg/L), salinity (7 PSU), pH (6.8 and 9.4), Secchi disk depths (75 and 205 cm), and water temperatures for growth (14 degrees C) and reproduction (30 degrees C). The CASM(ZM) also includes a bioenergetics framework that describes the growth of zebra mussels and their trophic impacts on aquatic food webs. The CASM(ZM) can be used to forecast the risk of successful dreissenid invasions and assess the associated impacts of invasive mussels on food web dynamics of previously uninfested aquatic systems throughout the St. Croix Basin.

Due to a remarkable restoration program, the lake has been recovering for the past 25 years after a massive decrease in total phosphorus (TP) loading. TP concentrations have decreased from about 100-120 to 20-25 mu g/L Additional efforts are, however, still required to obtain a perennially sustainable good ecological status and model parameterisation of fluxes can assist in predicting future outcomes, especially in the context of global warming. In this paper, a dynamic model (MeroLakeMab) was developed and tested with the purpose to reconstruct the loading history of Lake Bourget and to predict TP concentrations during scenarios of increased temperature, decreased water runoff and decreased P loading. Simulations suggested that the historical TP loading decrease may have been as extensive as 88%. Decreases in water discharge to Lake Bourget at magnitudes forecasted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would not affect TP concentrations notably, but marked concentration changes could, however, occur if decreases in runoff would have a strong impact on the TP loading. Increasing temperature effects on yearly mean TP concentrations in the water column would be very small compared to effects from changes in the TP loading. Predictions such as these could be instrumental for future successful lake management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,8,8,0,16,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The study presented the establishment of a Markov successional model (MSM) and its application to restoration reference in lower subtropical forest in China. The compositions of successional system in MSM were divided into three species types: pioneering pine trees, heliophytic trees and mesophytic trees. The successional system was divided into three subsystems: early successional stage, mid-successional stage and late-successional stage. Based on the site survey on the changes in the species and their individuals in 25 years, the transition matrices in various subsystems were determined. The predicted results were used to establish the restoration reference of the vegetation restoration in lower subtropical China. According to the ecological restoration reference established in this study, it would take 150 years for the forest to change from pioneer to mature communities in the region. Successional change of tree composition was forecast by the model, and the scenario forecast by the model reflects the actual conditions observed through 52 years of long-term permanent site research. The restoration experience in the region matches the forecast results. The application of a restoration reference model indicates that forest restoration can be accelerated by taking measures which change forest structure. The above results imply that a restoration reference established on the rule of regional forest succession could be very useful not only in directing, but also in assessing and managing regional forest restoration. Previously, one ""ideal reference ecosystem"" was used as a restoration reference in all correlative studies. In this study, the restoration ""process"" was used as the restoration reference.

Methods Three approaches were considered: (1) incorporating models of species migration to understand the ability of a species to occupy suitable habitat in new locations; (2) linking models of landscape disturbance and succession to models of habitat suitability; and (3) fully linking models of habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and spatially explicit population dynamics. Results Linking species-environment relationships, landscape dynamics and population dynamics in a multi-modelling framework allows the combined impacts of climate change (affecting species distribution and vital rates) and land cover dynamics (land use change, altered disturbance regimes) on species to be predicted. This approach is only feasible if the life history parameters and habitat requirements of the species are well understood.

Dreissenid effects were structured along two distinct energy pathways. For the pelagic-profundal pathway, large mean reductions in phytoplankton (-35% to -78%) and zooplankton (-40% to -77%) biomass occurred and were dependent on habitat type. The largest effects were found in rivers, followed by littoral and pelagic habitats in lakes. In contrast, benthic energy pathways within littoral habitats of lakes and rivers showed dramatic increases in mean benthic algal and macrophyte biomass (+170% to +180%), sediment-associated bacteria (about +2000%), non-dreissenid zoobenthic biomass (+160% to +210%), and total zoobenthic biomass, which includes dreissenid mussel soft tissues (+2000%). Our study quantifies the remarkable ability of these invasive mussels to shift aquatic food webs and energy flow from pelagic-profundal to benthic littoral energy pathways, and it provides a basis for forecasting their impacts in diverse freshwater ecosystems. Our meta-analysis approach was a powerful tool for moving beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual case studies and may be equally powerful for assessing impacts of other biological invaders.",,,,"Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016; Higgins, Scott/J-2044-2014","Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416",National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"Funding for this project was provided by a National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada fellowship to S.

However, forecasting the outcomes of this change for species and ecosystems remains a major challenge. In particular, predicting specific changes in systems where initial conditions, instabilities, and model errors have large impacts on the outcome is problematic. Indeed, predictive community ecology has been deemed unworthy of pursuit or an unreachable goal. However, new developments in large-scale biology provide ways of thinking that might substantially improve forecasts of local and regional impacts of climate change. Most notably, these are the explicit recognition of the regional and landscape contexts within which populations reside, the matrix approach that can be used to investigate the consequences of population variation across space and within assemblages, and the development of macrophysiology, which explicitly seeks to understand the ecological implications of physiological variation across large spatial and temporal scales. Here we explore how a combination of these approaches might promote further understanding and forecasting of the effects of global climate change and perhaps other GEC drivers on biodiversity.

Our study aimed to characterize these ocean temperature patterns at biologically relevant scales. Location Global, with a focus on coral reefs. Methods We created a 4-km resolution, 21-year global ocean temperature anomaly (deviations from long-term means) database to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature anomalies related to both coral bleaching and disease. Then we tested how patterns varied in several key metrics of disturbance severity, including anomaly frequency, magnitude, duration and size. Results Our analyses found both global variation in temperature anomalies and fine-grained spatial variability in the frequency, duration and magnitude of temperature anomalies. However, we discovered that even during major climatic events with strong spatial signatures, like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, areas that had high numbers of anomalies varied between years. In addition, we found that 48% of bleaching-related anomalies and 44% of disease-related anomalies were less than 50 km2, much smaller than the resolution of most models used to forecast climate changes. Main conclusions The fine-scale variability in temperature anomalies has several key implications for understanding spatial patterns in coral bleaching- and disease-related anomalies as well as for designing protected areas to conserve coral reefs in a changing climate. Spatial heterogeneity in temperature anomalies suggests that certain reefs could be targeted for protection because they exhibit differences in thermal stress. However, temporal variability in anomalies could complicate efforts to protect reefs, because high anomalies in one year are not necessarily predictive of future patterns of stress.

Whereas some components of global change, such as rising CO2, usually promote invasion, other components, such as changing temperature and precipitation, can help or hinder plant invasion. Additionally, experimental studies and models suggest that invasive plants often respond unpredictably to multiple components of global change acting in concert. Such variability adds uncertainty to existing risk assessments and other predictive tools. Here, we review current knowledge about relationships between plant invasion and global change, and highlight research needed to improve forecasts of invasion risk.

Thus there are possibilities of both increasing and decreasing river nutrients depending on national priorities. River flow rates which also influence the extent of hypoxia on the shelf may be altered by global climate change. We have therefore developed a series of simulations to forecast ecosystem response to alterations in nutrient loading and river flow. We simulate ecosystem response and hypoxia events using a linked model consisting of multiple phytoplankton groups competing for nitrogen, phosphorus and light, zooplankton grazing that is influenced by prey edibility and stoichiometry, sub-pycnocline water-column metabolism that is influenced by sinking fecal pellets and algal cells, and multi-element sediment diagenesis. This model formulation depicts four areas of increasing salinity moving westward away from the Mississippi River point of discharge, where the surface mixed layer, four bottom layers and underlying sediments are represented in each area. The model supports the contention that a 40% decrease in river nutrient will substantially reduce the duration and areal extent of hypoxia on the shelf. But it also suggests that in low and middle salinity areas the hypoxia response is saturated with respect to nutrients, and that in high salinity regions small increases in nutrient and river flow will have disproportionally large effects on GOM hypoxia. The model simulations also suggest that river discharge is a stronger factor influencing hypoxia than river nutrients in the Mississippi River plume. Finally, the model simulations suggest that primary production in the low salinity regions is light limited while primary production in the higher salinity zones is phosphate limited during the May to October period when hypoxia is prevalent in the Mississippi River plume.

Location Central California (USA). Methods The risk of dry or wet rainfall events was evaluated using conditional probabilities of rainfall depending on El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The propagation of rainfall perturbations on vegetation was calculated using cross-correlations between monthly seasonally adjusted (SA) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and SA antecedent rainfall at different time-scales. Results In this region, El Nino events are associated with higher than normal winter precipitation (probability of 73%). Opposite but more predictable effects are found for La Nina events (89% probability of dry events). Chaparral and evergreen forests showed the longest persistence of rainfall effects (0-8 months). Grasslands and wetlands showed low persistence (0-2 months), with wetlands dominated by non-stationary patterns. Within the region, the NDVI spatial patterns associated with higher (lower) rainfall are homogeneous (heterogeneous), with the exception of evergreen forests. Conclusions Knowledge of the time-scale of lagged effects of the non-seasonal component of rainfall on vegetation greenness, and the risk of winter rainfall anomalies lays the foundation for developing a forecasting model for vegetation greenness.

With the number of reported cases quickly growing, key features and commonalities have emerged. Fishery-induced trophic cascades often display differential response times and nonlinear trajectories among trophic levels and can be accompanied by shifts in alternative states. Furthermore, their magnitude appears to be context dependent, varying as a function of species diversity, regional oceanography, local physical disturbance, habitat complexity, and the nature of the fishery itself. To conserve and manage exploited marine ecosystems, there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading consequences of fishing. Future research should investigate how the trophic effects of fishing interact with other human disturbances, identify strongly interacting species and ecosystem features that confer resilience to exploitation, determine ranges of predator depletion that elicit trophic cascades, pinpoint antecedents that signal ecosystem state shifts, and quantify variation in trophic rates across oceanographic conditions. This information will advance predictive models designed to forecast the trophic effects of fishing and will allow managers to better anticipate and avoid fishery-induced trophic cascades.",,,,"Smith, Jennifer/E-5207-2013; Gaines, Steven/Y-3234-2019",,"David H.

Given that mountain species are particularly at risk due to climate warming, we selected one amphibian (Baetic midwife toad), one reptile (Lataste's viper), one bird (Bonelli's eagle), and one mammal (Iberian wild goat) present in Spanish mountains to model their distributional response to climate change during this century. Climate forecasts for the whole century were provided by the Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET; National Meteorological Agency) of Spain, which adapted the general circulation models CGCM2 and ECHAM4 and produced expected temperature and precipitation values for Spain according to the A2 and B2 emission scenarios. We constructed separate models of the species response to spatial, topographic, human, and climate variables using current values of the corresponding variables. We predicted future areas favourable to the species by replacing the current climate values with those expected according to each climate change scenario, while keeping spatial, topographic and human variables constant. Fuzzy logic was used to compute the coincidence between predictions for different emission scenarios in the same global circulation model, and the consistency between predictions for the same emission scenario applying different general circulation models. In general, coincidences were higher than consistencies and, thus, discrepancies between predictions were more attributable to uncertainty in global circulation models, i.e. our insufficient knowledge concerning the effect of the oceans and atmosphere on climate, than to the putative effect of different emission scenarios on future climates. Our conclusion is that species distribution models in climate warming scenarios are still not useful for informing emission policy planning, although they have great potential as tools once consistencies become higher than coincidences.",,,,"Olivero, Jesus/K-8727-2014; Marquez, Ana Luz/K-8345-2014; ESTRADA, ALBA/A-9632-2018; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010","Olivero, Jesus/0000-0003-1714-0360; Marquez, Ana Luz/0000-0001-5586-9334; ESTRADA, ALBA/0000-0003-2727-1970; Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284","Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia, SpainJunta de Andalucia [P05-RNM-00935]; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of Spain and FEDERGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CGL2006-09567, CGL2009-11316]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha (Spain)Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [FSE 2007-2013]","This work was partially financed by the Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia, Spain (project P05-RNM-00935) and the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of Spain and FEDER (projects CGL2006-09567 and CGL2009-11316).

Current challenges in the application of these tools include: (1) accounting for large uncertainty in model parameters, which may violate assumptions of ""local"" perturbation metrics such as sensitivities and elasticities, and (2) forecasting not only asymptotic rates of spatial spread, as is usually done, but also transient spatial dynamics in the early stages of invasion. We developed an invasion model for the Diaprepes root weevil (DRW; Diaprepes abbreviatus [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]), a generalist herbivore that has invaded citrus-growing regions of the United States. We synthesized data on DRW demography and dispersal and generated predictions for asymptotic and transient peak invasion speeds, accounting for parameter uncertainty. We quantified the contributions of each parameter toward invasion speed using a ""global"" perturbation analysis, and we contrasted parameter contributions during the transient and asymptotic phases. We found that the asymptotic invasion speed was 0.02-0.028 km/week, although the transient peak invasion speed (0.03- 0.045 km/week) was significantly greater. Both asymptotic and transient invasions speeds were most responsive to weevil dispersal distances. However, demographic parameters that had large effects on asymptotic speed (e.g., survival of early-instar larvae) had little effect on transient speed. Comparison of the global analysis with lower-level elasticities indicated that local perturbation analysis would have generated unreliable predictions for the responsiveness of invasion speed to underlying parameters. Observed range expansion in southern Florida (1992-2006) was significantly lower than the invasion speed predicted by the model. Possible causes of this mismatch include overestimation of dispersal distances, demographic rates, and spatiotemporal variation in parameter values. This study demonstrates, that, when parameter uncertainty is large, as is often the case, global perturbation analyses are needed to identify which points in the life cycle should be targets of management. Our results also suggest that effective strategies for reducing spread during the asymptotic phase may have little effect during the transient phase.",,,,,,USDA National Research InitiativeUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2007-02270]; University of Nebraska Research Council,WC thank Brian Inouye and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on this manuscript.

We first describe how nonlinearities in combination with environmental variability lead to model descriptions that will not have smooth potentials, concluding that many ecological systems are described by systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show typical leading indicators of regime shifts.

Many methodological decisions, taken during the modelling process and forecasts, may, however, lead to a large variability in the assessment of future impacts. Using measures of species range change and turnover, the potential impacts of climate change on French stream fish species and assemblages were evaluated. Our main focus was to quantify the uncertainty in the projections of these impacts arising from four sources of uncertainty: initial datasets (Data), statistical methods [species distribution models (SDM)], general circulation models (GCM), and gas emission scenarios (GES). Several modalities of the aforementioned uncertainty sources were combined in an ensemble forecasting framework resulting in 8400 different projections. The variance explained by each source was then extracted from this whole ensemble of projections. Overall, SDM contributed to the largest variation in projections, followed by GCM, whose contribution increased over time equalling almost the proportion of variance explained by SDM in 2080. Data and GES had little influence on the variability in projections. Future projections of range change were more consistent for species with a large geographical extent (i.e., distribution along latitudinal or stream gradients) or with restricted environmental requirements (i.e., small thermal or elevation ranges). Variability in projections of turnover was spatially structured at the scale of France, indicating that certain particular geographical areas should be considered with care when projecting the potential impacts of climate change. The results of this study, therefore, emphasized that particular attention should be paid to the use of predictions ensembles resulting from the application of several statistical methods and climate models. Moreover, forecasted impacts of climate change should always be provided with an assessment of their uncertainty, so that management and conservation decisions can be taken in the full knowledge of their reliability.",,,,"Grenouillet, Gael/C-8710-2011; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Casajus, Nicolas/0000-0002-5537-5294",EUEuropean Union (EU) [GOEC-CT-2003-505540],"This research was part of the EU project Euro-Limpacs (contract number GOEC-CT-2003-505540).

Disturbance can play an important role in these dynamics, by initiating cycles of secondary succession and generating opportunities for communities of long-lived organisms to reorganize in alternative configurations. This study used landscape-scale variations in environmental conditions, stand structure, and disturbance from an extreme fire year in Alaska to examine how these factors affected successional trajectories in boreal forests dominated by black spruce. Because fire intervals in interior Alaska are typically too short to allow relay succession, the initial cohorts of seedlings that recruit after fire largely determine future canopy composition. Consequently, in a dynamically stable landscape, postfire tree seedling composition should resemble that of the prefire forest stands, with little net change in tree composition after fire. Seedling recruitment data from 90 burned stands indicated that postfire establishment of black spruce was strongly linked to environmental conditions and was highest at sites that were moist and had high densities of prefire spruce. Although deciduous broadleaf trees were absent from most prefire stands, deciduous trees recruited from seed at many sites and were most abundant at sites where the fires burned severely, consuming much of the surface organic layer. Comparison of pre- and postfire tree composition in the burned stands indicated that the expected trajectory of black spruce self-replacement was typical only at moist sites that burned with low fire severity. At severely burned sites, deciduous trees dominated the postfire tree seedling community, suggesting these sites will follow alternative, deciduous-dominated trajectories of succession. Increases in the severity of boreal fires with climate warming may catalyze shifts to an increasingly deciduous-dominated landscape, substantially altering landscape dynamics and ecosystem services in this part of the boreal forest.",,,,"Johnstone, Jill F./C-9204-2009","Johnstone, Jill F./0000-0001-6131-9339; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",US Joint Fire Science Program [05-1-2-06]; Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research site; US Forest Service PNW Research Station,"This research was supported by funding from the US Joint Fire Science Program (project 05-1-2-06) and in-kind support from the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research site and US Forest Service PNW Research Station.

J,"Pieri, P",,,,"Pieri, Philippe",,,Modelling radiative balance in a row-crop canopy: Cross-row distribution of net radiation at the soil surface and energy available to clusters in a vineyard,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy balance; View factor; Soil temperature; Vineyard; Row-crop; Microclimate,LIGHT INTERCEPTION; SOLAR-RADIATION; LEAF-AREA; TEMPERATURE; FRUIT; TRANSPIRATION; GRAPES; WATER; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Distribution of energy at the soil surface in a row-crop influences mainly soil temperature and water content, and therefore root activity, nitrogen mineralization and within canopy air temperature, which all affect plant physiology. In the case of a vineyard, it is also closely related to the energy available to the berries and therefore most influential for fruit quality. The aim of this study was to develop a simplified model of available energy distribution at the soil surface and at the bottom of the rows, where most of the clusters are located. Such a model would be helpful for optimising some aspects of row-crop management like training system choice, row geometry, leaf area density, and soil surface maintenance practices. The model simulated radiation balance at the soil surface, split up into downward and upward short- and long-wave fluxes. Row shadows were calculated at any point of the inter-row space, in interaction with actual row geometry and simplified porosity distribution within row volume. All hemispheric radiations (long-wave and diffuse solar radiation) were calculated according to view factors between the row and soil surfaces. Input variables were therefore incoming solar radiation over the canopy, air temperatures near the row walls and soil surface temperatures. Parameters were row geometry, dimensions and porosities. The model was validated in a 7 years old Merlot vineyard in the Medoc area, by comparing model predictions to measured net radiation (Rns) at five positions above the inter-row soil surface. Along the row sampling was achieved by a moving device carrying the net-radiometers. Structure of the vegetation was kept constant during the experiment and gap fraction parameters were derived from pictures of shadows at the soil surface. Since Rns measurements are impracticable directly at the soil surface and horizontal distribution of Rns is heterogeneous, comparison was performed by calculating net radiation at the actual measurement height which was close to average cluster height. Model prediction agreed with field measurement in most conditions, which suggests that all short- and long-wave radiation fluxes, as well as interactions with the canopy structure, were well described. Rns, energy available to clusters, and soil surface temperature variations were all mainly driven by shading due to the rows. Coupling the model to soil heat transfer and convective fluxes to the atmosphere models will help forecasting soil temperature distribution at the surface and in depth as well as canopy microclimate. The model will also be an essential part of a more elaborate model of cluster microclimate, a key determinant of berry quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the last twenty years the spread of fountain grass in the Canary Islands has been very rapid. We compared its ecophysiological, architectural and reproductive traits with those of three native grasses (Hyparrhenia hirta, Cenchrus ciliaris and Aristida adscensionis) in two habitats of Tenerife Island which differ in rainfall. The detection of traits that differ between native and invader grasses may provide information for the improved control and eradication of the latter contributing to protect the native plant diversity. P. setaceum and the native grasses differed in all measured traits and in their response to water availability which is more restricted in the southern site. Specific leaf area was lower in P. setaceum than in the native grasses. Although this reduces carbon assimilation per unit area, it also reduces transpiration, increasing water use efficiency and contributes to the maintenance of high relative water content. Leaf N in P. setaceum was lower than in the native grasses indicating higher nitrogen use efficiency. The activity of photosystem II was higher and lasted longer in P. setaceum than in the native grasses. The ecophysiological traits of P. setaceum support its large size, extensive canopy and shorter leaf senescence period. They confer considerable competitive advantage to the invader and partially explain its success in the Canary Islands. The differences between the invader and the native grasses were maintained in both sites revealing a good adaptation of P. setaceum to the low resource local habitats in the Canary Islands and confirms its large plasticity. The large invasive potential of P. setaceum, in concert with the projected global changes, forecast eventual risks for the conservation of the endemic flora and remaining native communities in the Canary Islands.

The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel.",,,,"Hamilton, Stephen K/N-2979-2014; Jacobi, Claudia/B-7510-2013","Hamilton, Stephen K/0000-0002-4702-9017; ",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); PELD and CTHIDRO programs; Embrapa Pantanal; US Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [RD83170801],"The work was supported by The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), PELD and CTHIDRO programs, and Embrapa Pantanal.

We quantified fish species sensitivity to several classes of land use and determined if trends varied among three geoclimatic regions of Maryland, USA. Our approach compares the cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) of sites where a species was expected to occur to the CFD of those where it was collected to estimate the species-specific maximum degree of land use tolerated and the minimal amount that may induce an impact. Fishes were most vulnerable to urban land use gradients, though trends were region-specific with heightened sensitivity in the Piedmont (64-72% of species negatively affected) relative to the Coastal Plain (45-52% negatively affected). Species found in both regions exhibited greater vulnerability to urbanization in the Piedmont. Responses to agricultural land use were less severe though trends were region-specific as well with the least sensitive in the Piedmont and the greatest negative impact in the Highlands region. In many cases, reduced population abundances were detected at lower levels of land use relative to the range where the species was apparently extirpated. Our results demonstrate that population reduction and species loss due to land use change differs substantially among regions, even within a single species. Greater sensitivity observed in abundance-weighted analyses implies that further loss of fish diversity may be impending in impacted streams. Our results have direct application to prioritize conservation resources and forecast future declines in species distributions and biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, well-intentioned management plans may not meet this balance as most do not include the effect of climate change. Ocean temperatures are expected to increase through the 21st century, which will have far-reaching and complex impacts on marine fisheries. To begin to quantify these impacts for one coastal fishery along the cast coast of the United States, we develop a coupled climate population model for Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The model is based on a mechanistic hypothesis: recruitment is determined by temperature-driven, overwinter mortality of juveniles in their estuarine habitats. Temperature forecasts were obtained from 14 general circulation models simulating three CO2 emission scenarios. An ensemble-based approach was used in which a multimodel average was calculated for a given CO2 emission scenario to forecast the response of the population. The coupled model indicates that both exploitation and climate change significantly affect abundance and distribution of Atlantic croaker. At current levels of fishing, the average (2010-2100) spawning biomass of the population is forecast to increase by 60-100%. Similarly, the center of the population is forecast to shift 50-100 km northward. A yield analysis, which is used to calculate benchmarks for fishery management, indicates that the maximum sustainable yield will increase by 30-100%. Our results demonstrate that climate effects on fisheries must be identified, understood, and incorporated into the scientific advice provided to managers if sustainable exploitation is to be achieved in a changing climate.",,,,"Alexander, Michael A/A-7097-2013","Alexander, Michael A/0000-0001-9646-6427",,,,,120,121,2,55,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Unfortunately, the native resolutions of global climate models (usually approximately 2 degrees x 2 degrees or coarser) are inadequate for modeling future changes in, e.g., biodiversity, species distributions, crop yields, and water resources. Also, 21st-century climate projections must be debiased prior to use, i.e., corrected for systematic offsets between modeled representations and observations of present climates. We have downscaled future temperature and precipitation projections from the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) CMIP3 multi-model data set to 10-minute resolution and debiased these simulations using the change-factor approach and observational data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU). These downscaled data sets are available online and include monthly mean temperatures and precipitation for 2041-2060 and 2081-2100, for 24 climate models and the A1B, A2, and B1 emission scenarios. This paper describes the downscaling method and compares the downscaled and native-resolution simulations. Sharp differences between the original and downscaled data sets are apparent at regional to continental scales, particularly for temperature in mountainous areas and in areas with substantial differences between observed and simulated 20th-century climatologies. Although these data sets in principle could be downscaled further, a key practical limitation is the density of observational networks, particularly for precipitation-related variables in tropical mountainous regions. These downscaled data sets can be used for a variety of climate-impact assessments, including assessments or 21st-century climate-change impacts on biodiversity and species distributions.",,,,,,"Office of Science, U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Conservation International; Land Tenure Center at the University of Wisconsin; Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin; Environment Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Walton Family Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation","We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel data set.

Since Sin Nombre virus was discovered in the U.S. in 1993, longitudinal studies of the rodent reservoir host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) have demonstrated a qualitative correlation among mouse population dynamics and risk of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, indicating the importance of understanding deer mouse population dynamics for evaluating risk of HPS. 2. Using capture-mark-recapture statistical methods on a 15-year data set from Montana, we estimated deer mouse survival, maturation and recruitment rates and tested the relative importance of seasonality, population density and local climate in explaining temporal variation in deer mouse demography. 3. From these estimates, we designed a population model to simulate deer mouse population dynamics given climatic variables and compared the model to observed patterns. 4. Month, precipitation 5 months previously, temperature 5 months previously and to a lesser extent precipitation and temperature in the current month, were important in determining deer mouse survival. Month, the sum of precipitation over the last 4 months, and the sum of the temperature over the last 4 months were important in determining recruitment rates. Survival was more important in determining the growth rate of the population than recruitment. 5. While climatic drivers appear to have a complex influence on dynamics, our forecasts were good.

Location Austria. Methods Species distribution models, which deliver habitat-based information on potential distributions, and interacting particle systems, which simulate spatio-temporal range dynamics as dependent on neighbourhood configurations, were combined into a common framework. We then used the combined model to simulate the invasion of A. artemisiifolia in Austria between 1990 and 2005. For comparison, simulations were also performed with models that accounted only for habitat suitability or neighbourhood configurations. The fit of the three models to the data was assessed by likelihood ratio tests, and simulated invasion patterns were evaluated against observed ones in terms of predictive discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I). Results The combined model fitted the data significantly better than the single-component alternatives. Simulations relying solely on parameterized spread kernels performed worst in terms of both AUC and spatial pattern formation. Simulations based only on habitat information correctly predicted infestation of susceptible areas but reproduced the autocorrelated patterns of A. artemisiifolia expansion less adequately than did the integrated model. Main conclusions Our integrated modelling approach offers a flexible tool for forecasts of spatio-temporal invasion patterns from landscape to regional scales. As a further advantage, scenarios of environmental change can be incorporated consistently by appropriately updating habitat suitability layers. Given the susceptibility of many alien plants, including A. artemisiifolia, to both land use and climate changes, taking such scenarios into account will increasingly become relevant for the design of proactive management strategies.",,,,,"Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887; Leitner, Michael/0000-0002-4975-6787; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112",Austrian Academy of Sciences; Austrian research programme AUSTROCLIM; European Science Commission [036866: ECOCHANGE],"This work was supported by the Austrian Academy of Sciences within the Global Change Programme, the Austrian research programme AUSTROCLIM, and the European Science Commission (FP 6 project 036866: ECOCHANGE).

We observed more statistically significant shifts in transcription levels of genes in response to thermal stress than in response to water stress.

Invasive ungulates with eruptive population dynamics can degrade sensitive habitats, harbour disease-causing pathogens and facilitate the spread of weedy plants. Hence there is a need globally for cost-effective density reduction and damage mitigation strategies. User-friendly software tools that facilitate effective decision making by managers (who are not usually scientists) can help in understanding uncertainty and maximising benefits to native biodiversity within a constrained budget. 2. We designed an easy-to-use spreadsheet model - the Spatio-Temporal Animal Reduction (STAR) model - for strategic management of large feral ungulates (pigs, swamp buffalo and horses) within the World Heritage Kakadu National Park in Australia. The main goals of the model are to help park managers understand the landscape and population dynamics that influence the number and distribution of feral ungulates in time and space. 3. The model is a practical tool and methodological advance that provides a forecast of the effects and financial costs of proposed management plans. Feral animal management in the park is complex because populations cover an extensive area comprised of diverse and difficult-to-access habitats. There are also large reservoir populations in the regions surrounding the park, and these can provide immigrants even after within-park control operations. To provide the optimal outcomes for the reduction of feral animals, STAR is spatially explicit in relation to habitat, elevation and regions of culling, and applies density-feedback models in a lattice framework (multi-layer grid) to determine the optimal cost-benefit ratio of control choices. A series of spatial and nonspatial optimisation routines yielding the best cost-benefit approaches to culling are provided. 4. The spreadsheet module is flexible and adaptable to other regions and species, and is made available for testing and modifying. Users can operate STAR without having prior expert knowledge of animal management theory and application. The intuitive spreadsheet format could render it effective as a teaching or training tool for undergraduate students and landscape managers who might not have detailed ecological backgrounds.",,,,"McMahon, Clive R/D-5713-2013; Collier, Neil/F-4729-2010; Bradshaw, Corey J.A./A-1311-2008; Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011","McMahon, Clive R/0000-0001-5241-8917; Bradshaw, Corey J.A./0000-0002-5328-7741; Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517",Parks Australia; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0669303],"We thank I.

Seed bank estimation is used to predict the possibility of future weed infestations in rangelands as well as the nascent native plant diversity within them. However, there is no standardized method of reporting seed bank evaluation techniques, limiting the ability to compare across studies. After sowing known quantities of cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum (L.); brome fescue, Vulpia bromoides (L., S.F. Gray); pigweed, Amaranthus retroflexus (L.); kochia, Kochia scoparia (L. Schrad.); lambsquarters, Chenopodium album (L.); and field pepperweed, Lepidium campestre (L. R. Br.) into sterile soil, we compared two different watering regimes in two soil types to Petri plate germination of these seeds. Seed bank estimations from the emergence method were lower compared to estimations from the Petri plate germination. Top-and-bottom watering increased absolute abundance, and the rank order of abundance among species changed with watering method. Emergence levels were the same between the two soil types. The higher water availability of the top-and-bottom watering method resulted in greater seedling emergence (26.3% +/- 10% SD vs. 9.1% +/- 7.5% SD). Lower emergence compared to germination (62.3% +/- 24.4%) may indicate that emergence is an important postgermination barrier to seedling establishment. While emergence techniques may not accurately portray the volume of seeds in the soil, they may more accurately predict which plants can become established in field conditions. Our different species abundances between watering methods show that multiple emergence methods may need to be employed to forecast a range of future rangeland conditions from the soil seed bank.",,,,"Perkins, Lora B/C-3329-2016","Perkins, Lora B/0000-0002-0689-4995; Espeland, Erin/0000-0001-8541-3610",US Bureau of Reclamation [06FC204044],"This project was funded in part by a grant under Public Law 109-103, Section 208(a), through the US Bureau of Reclamation (Cooperative Agreement 06FC204044).",,,22,22,2,41,,,,1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

The Plymouth Marine Laboratory monitoring database for station L4 was used to build annual TTSS patterns (1992-2005) and estimate their similarity with the help of hierarchical cluster analysis. Almost identical TTSS patterns were observed each year. While the height of the main peaks was slightly variable, their horizontal positions were unchanged. Whereas the above patterns resembled the phytoplankton TTSS established for the subtropical Lake Kinneret, the L4 spectrum size range was much broader and the distance between the main peaks approximately two times greater. The similarity level (Pearson r = 0.872-0.992) in TTSS pairs for station L4 was comparable to the estimates established at several lakes, while being much higher than in the inter-ecosystem (L4 and Kinneret) pairs (r = 0.317-0.578). Thus, the phenomenon of long-term consistency of phytoplankton taxonomic size structure, found previously at freshwater ecosystems, for the first time is confirmed for marine phytoplankton, which speaks in favor of much higher generality of this important structural property of aquatic communities. The TTSS multi-annual consistency can be helpful for long-term monitoring, environment protection and forecasting. The evident and permanent difference in the peak positions between ecosystems opens a way for additional analyses which can be helpful for the development of theoretical models. A set of plausible mechanisms, capable to produce and support the empirically obtained distribution patterns, is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is recognized that river hydraulics and morphology play important roles in mussel distribution. To assess the hydraulic influences of bridge replacement on mussel habitat, metrics such as depth, velocity, and their derivatives (shear stress, Froude number) were collected or computed. The objectives of the project were to evaluate mussel and hydraulic data at a reference site and to compare those findings to a bridge-replacement site. The findings were used to support a statistical analysis, which establishes correlations between mussel count and hydraulics, and a numerical model to forecast habitat based on the statistics. ArcGIS was selected to manage the data and generate a grid to compute area statistics for 3319, 4.9-m x 4.9-m cells (cell) for total mussel count, depth, velocity, shear stress, and Froude number. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test indicated no statistical significance between the total mussel count and the hydraulic variables: however, trellis graphs were used to account for the spatial variability in the data set. For the flow conditions measured, the total mussel count per cell is greatest at sections where (I) velocities range from 0.061 to 0.21 m/s, (2) shear stresses range from 0.48 to 3.8 dyne/cm(2), and (3) Froude numbers range from 0.006 to 0.04. Based on the statistical targets established, the hydraulic model results suggest that an additional 2428 m(2) or a 30-percent increase in suitable mussel habitat could be generated at the replacement-bridge site when compared to the baseline condition associated with the existing bridge at that same location. The study did not address the influences of substrate, acid mine drainage, sediment loads from tributaries, and surface-water/ground-water exchange on mussel habitat. Future studies could include methods for quantifying (1) channel-substrate composition and distribution using tools such as hydroacoustic echosounders specifically designed and calibrated to identify bed composition and mussel populations, (2) surface-water and ground-water interactions, and (3) a high-streamflow event.

We use a highly complex and spatially explicit simulation model of a predator-prey mite system to generate simple presence-absence data: the number of patches with both prey and predators, with prey only, with predators only, and with neither species, along with the number of patches that change from one state to another in each time step. The average number of patches in the four states, as well as the average transition probabilities from one state to another, are then depicted in a state transition diagram, constituting the ""footprints"" of the underlying population dynamics. We investigate to what extent changes in the population processes modeled in the complex simulation (i.e. the predator's functional response and the dispersal rates of both species) are reflected by different footprints. The transition probabilities can be used to forecast the expected fate of a system given its current state. However, the transition probabilities in the modeled system depend on the number of patches in each state. We develop a model for the dependence of transition probabilities on state variables, and combine this information in a Markov chain transition matrix model. Finally, we use this extended model to predict the long-term dynamics of the system and to reveal its asymptotic steady state properties.",,,,"Borregaard, Michael/B-8442-2008","Borregaard, Michael/0000-0002-8146-8435",,,,,4,4,1,11,,,,0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2010,33,1,,,,,137,147,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06045.x,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000275205200014,,,,,

New, derivative-based insurance products (financial instruments designed to allow the commoditization and sale of risk) have been developed that allow investors to insure risk in exchange for fixed payments. Modifications to these financial derivatives, which are used to distribute risk and stabilize forecasts across many corporate and social scenarios, could allow purchasers to take preventative action to simultaneously protect their investment and decrease the likelihood of the insured event. We propose that governments issue modified derivative contracts to sell species' extinction risk to market investors and stakeholders.

Knowledge of forest change is often formalized in state-and-transition models (STMs). These models generate forecasts of forest condition that are widely used for forest management planning. Common techniques for evaluating such models are complex, requiring specialized skills not available to non-modellers. Consequently, model transparency can be limited, hampering collaborative resource modelling that otherwise may increase the chances of management success. 2. We demonstrate evaluation of STMs through network visualization that produces intuitively accessible results, comparable to results of more commonly applied, complex techniques. To evaluate this approach, we statistically test model similarities with empirical data. As examples, we use STMs of forest change, alternately parameterized with information from experts and literature, and compare them to our empirical reference information. 3. Graph theoretical analyses revealed differences in structure and dynamics between alternate STMs. For example, compared to empirical STMs, expert STMs were less complex while literature STMs were more complex. Overall, expert STMs were less similar to empirical STMs than were literature STMs, suggesting information in the expert STMs may deviate more strongly from empirical reference data. 4. We used several techniques that provided complementary information, which produced a comprehensive view of network similarity. We speculate that differences between expert and empirical STMs result from lower complexity of mental models compared to empirical data. While we illustrated our approach using a simple matrix model, it could be adapted for more complex STMs. Improvements of the proposed approach could involve representation of forest change rates with waiting times depicted by multigraphs. 5. Synthesis and applications. Common evaluations of forest change STMs involve complex techniques not easily accessible to non-modellers. Approaching such models as networks makes their evaluation and statistical testing intuitively accessible to many audiences. Benefits of this approach to modellers include improved communication about models with non-modellers, while benefits to stakeholders and decision makers include enhanced understanding of models. This may aid a collaborative resource modelling process and should improve the chances of successful resource management plan implementation. While we used an example from boreal forests, our approach could be applied to many other vegetation types globally.",,,,,,,,,,6,6,1,11,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J. Appl.

Key difficulties include managing an array of biophysical and socioeconomic processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales, and acquiring and utilizing empirical data to support the analysis of those processes. The Southeastern and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States, two heavily forested regions with significant forest industries, are examined in the context of these foundational elements. Geographic setting fundamentally affects both the primary land cover (forest) in the two regions, and the structure and form of land use (forestry). Land-use histories of the regions can be used to parameterize land-use models, validate model performance, and explore land-use scenarios. Drivers of change in the two regions are many and varied, with issues of scale and complexity posing significant challenges. Careful scenario development can be used to simplify process-based land-use models, and can improve our ability to address specific research questions. The successful modeling of land-use change in these two areas requires integration of both top-down and bottom-up drivers of change, using scenario frameworks to both guide and simplify the modeling process. Modular approaches, with utilization and integration of existing process models, allow regional land-use modelers the opportunity to better represent primary drivers of land-use change.

In rural areas, even subtle changes in farming practices can affect landscape features and functions, and consequently the environment. Fine-scale analyses have to be performed to better understand the land cover change processes. At the same time, models of land cover change have to be developed in order to anticipate where changes are more likely to occur next. Such predictive information is essential to propose and implement sustainable and efficient environmental policies. Future landscape studies can provide a framework to forecast how land use and land cover changes is likely to react differently to subtle changes. This paper proposes a four step framework to forecast landscape futures at fine scales by coupling scenarios and landscape modelling approaches. This methodology has been tested on two contrasting agricultural landscapes located in the United States and France, to identify possible landscape changes based on forecasting and backcasting agriculture intensification scenarios. Both examples demonstrate that relatively subtle land cover and land use changes can have a large impact on future landscapes. Results highlight how such subtle changes have to be considered in term of quantity, location, and frequency of land use and land cover to appropriately assess environmental impacts on water pollution (France) and soil erosion (US).

Fire, climate and vegetation patterns produce non-linear fire propagation across the landscape. Environmental heterogeneity, like outcrop presence and hare density, increases landscape patchiness and makes possible the occupation of fire refuges by plants, like Fabiana imbricata shrubs. We monitored shrub recruitment and cover during nine postfire years in northwestern Patagonia grasslands and we studied the long-term population dynamics under different environmental conditions through a matrix model, exploring different fire frequencies and spring precipitation regimes. Both, the field monitoring and the model seem to confirm the relationships between shrub invasion and fire. The climate change forecast predicts an increase in the frequency of El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena that could causes more coupled fires-rainy springs in northwestern Patagonia, and consequently, more recruitment windows for shrubs, like F. imbricata. The matrix model also indicates that this scenario would be the most favourable for shrub invasion.

We modelled its geographical distribution with the objective of predicting its historical, current and future (in face of climatic changes) geographical distributions. We also tested the assumption that the species tracks similar ecological conditions while seasonally migrating. Finally, we estimated the overlap between its predicted distributions and the current protected areas network. We used eight modelling techniques in an ensemble-forecasting approach to reach consensus distributional scenarios. The modelled historical breeding and wintering ranges covered a larger area than today. Its current year-round distribution is located in the same region as before but decreased by 13%, whereas the breeding range decreased by 32%, and the wintering range by 43%. The future year-round distribution is predicted to decrease by 47% and shift to east by 2060. Even more drastic decreases in range are predicted for breeding (63%) and wintering (91%) ranges. The niches of the breeding and wintering distributions are good predictors of the records of the other season. The greatest variation (SDs) in the predictions comes from modelling tools and GCMs, and little from climatic scenarios. However, variation in predictions were small within high probability regions for modelling tools by higher everywhere for GCMs and climatic scenarios. The Red-spectacled Amazon is currently underrepresented (<1% of year-round range, and <4% of each seasonal range) in the current reserve system. A broad view over all estimated and predicted ranges revealed that a small portion of the range has a very important role in current and future conservation actions for this bird - in the northeast part of state of Rio Grande do Sul and southeast state of Santa Catarina, Brazil.

These unpredictable aquatic systems, characterised by large environmental fluctuations, are under severe stress due to human activities. Increasing pressures (e. g. over-harvesting, eutrophication, habitat loss) inevitably lead to the degradation of these ecosystems. Analysis of the complexity of species distribution patterns within and among TW habitats is relevant to understanding the underlying processes and promoting appropriate management strategies. Assessment of the trophic status is one of the most critical aspects of TWs. Untangling the relevance of anthropogenic nutrient inputs from internal biogeochemical processes is of primary importance in defining appropriate restoration strategies. Biotic indices have been suggested as an operational tool to assess environmental quality in TWs. However, the application in TWs of indices developed for coastal waters can give distorted results (e. g. low species diversity and high abundance are natural features). The BITS approach provides a rapid assessment of ecological quality, although its sensitivity in reflecting field conditions remains to be assessed. The major challenge to TWs management is to couple long-term conservation with productive activities. This goal can be achieved using an integrated approach, forecasting conservation of TW ecosystem functioning together with sustainable economic development. North-western Adriatic TW habitats have been exploited for centuries and major shifts in ecological processes have occurred. In this study, knowledge of the ecological features of these habitats is summarised and analysed using recent ecological tools. Based on these findings, possible strategies for conservative management have been discussed.",,,,"Bartoli, Marco/E-5321-2017; Giordani, Gianmarco/A-3011-2011; Viaroli, Pierluigi/M-3762-2014; Ponti, Massimo/R-3093-2016","Bartoli, Marco/0000-0002-5022-6206; Giordani, Gianmarco/0000-0002-5726-6470; Viaroli, Pierluigi/0000-0002-6396-2894; Ponti, Massimo/0000-0002-6521-1330; Abbiati, Marco/0000-0002-2426-4524",,,,,15,19,1,35,,,,0275-7540,1029-0370,,CHEM ECOL,Chem.

NMR analysis of the peat samples in the progressive heating stages showed the concentration of heterocyclic N-forms, the maximum structural transition amide-to-heterocyclic forms being observed in samples heated for 120s (56% heterocyclic N and 34% aromatic C). Under more drastic conditions all N-forms were depleted. Correlation between spectroscopic and pyrolytic data betrayed specific pyrolytic markers for the different N-forms. The intensity of the 15N-NMR amide peak tended to be positively correlated to the yield of indoles, imidazoles and pyrazoles, and negatively correlated to those of benzonitriles and pyrazines. Analytical pyrolysis also showed a progressive enrichment in lipids and alkyl macromolecules with increasing heating intensity, and a decrease in lignin-derived, polysaccharide-derived and N-containing compounds. The relative abundance of non-methoxyphenolic aromatic compounds did not change. The N-compounds in peat samples unheated or heated for 60-90s released methylpyrazole, dimethylpyrroline, methyldiphenylindole and pyrazole, whereas peat samples heated for 120s mainly yielded methylpyrazine and methyldiphenylindole. Dimethylpyrroline and pyrazine prevailed in samples heated for 150 s, whereas samples heated for 180s yielded mainly pyrrole. Pyrolysis data presented low possibilities for forecasting the extent of the O-alkyl domain, but reflected quantitatively the transformations in the lignin-like moiety.

One key point is that all development policy should be formulated using forecasts from climate science as a baseline. When this is not done, there is risk that a false status quo without climate change is seen as an implicit baseline. Another key point is that authors must be clearer about their behavioral assumptions: Many studies either (problematically) assume profit maximization on the side of farm households, or do not specify behavioral assumptions at all. A third important point is that the allocation of rights is crucial for the results; if households have a right to maintain their current livelihoods, the costs of climate change in developing countries are considerably greater than traditional willingness-to-pay studies would indicate. Thus, costs and benefits of climate change adaptation cannot be analyzed using economic aspects only; climate science, behavioral science, and legal and moral aspects have crucial implications for the outcome of the analysis.",,,,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",,,,,25,26,2,39,,,,0077-8923,,978-1-57331-766-5,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2010,1185,,,,,,150,163,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05168.x,,,,Ecology; Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000277794400010,20146767,,,,

Unfortunately, few studies examine both the direct and indirect pathways of impact. Doing so is important because altered competitive pressures can reduce or magnify the direct responses of a focal species to climate change. Here. we examine the effects of changing rainfall on three rare annual plant species in the presence and absence of competition on the California Channel Islands. We used rain-out shelters and hand watering to exclude and augment early, late, and season-long rainfall, spanning the wide range of precipitation change forecast for the region. In the absence of competition, droughts reduced the population growth rates of two of three Cocal annuals, while increased rainfall was only sometimes beneficial. As compared to the focal species, the dominant competitors were more sensitive to the precipitation treatments, benefiting from increased season-long precipitation and harmed by droughts. Importantly, the response of two of three competitors to the precipitation treatments tended to be positively correlated with those of the focal annuals. Although this leads to the expectation that increased competition will counter the direct benefits of favorable conditions, such indirect effects of precipitation change proved weak to nonexistent in our experiment. Competitors had little influence on the precipitation response of two focal species, due to their low sensitivity to competition and highly variable precipitation responses. Competition did affect low our third focal species responded to precipitation change, but this effect only approached significance, and whether it truly resulted from competitor response to precipitation change was unclear. Our work suggests that even, when competitors respond to climate change, these responses may have little effect on the focal species. Ultimately, the strength of the indirect effect depends on how strongly climate change alters competition. and how sensitive focal species are to changes in competition.",,,,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0351608],"This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant 0351608.

We quantified changes in fish assemblages within seagrass meadows of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) between the 1970s and 2006-2007, and observed changes consistent with this forecast. During 2006-2007 we sampled seagrass meadows using the same gears and methods previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal waters of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s. Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous additions to the fish fauna during 2006-2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s, including: Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper), Epinephelus morio (red grouper), Chaetodon ocellatus (spotfin butterflyfish), Mycteroperca sp (grouper, non gag), Centropristis philadelphica (rock sea bass), Fistularia tabacaria (bluespotted cornetfish), Ocyurus chrysurus (yellowtail snapper), Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), Abudefduf saxatilis (sergeant major), Acanthuridae spp. (surgeonfishes) and Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish). Several other species showed large increases in abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006, including Mycteroperca microlepis (gag grouper, up similar to 200 x), Lutjanus griseus (gray snapper, up similar to 105 x), and Nicholsina usta (emerald parrotfish, up similar to 22 x). All of these are tropical or subtropical species that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblages in the northern GOM than in the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and sea surface temperatures (>3 degrees C) during the similar to 30 years that separate Livingston's samples and ours that correlate with northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes. Documenting these range shifts is a critical first step in investigating the consequences of global warming for endemic marine communities and fishery production in the northern GOM.",,,,,"Powers, Sean/0000-0002-4770-9944",National Marine Fisheries Service; Dauphin Island Sea Lab,"We thank M.

This study describes changes in temperate subtidal reef communities over decadal and regional scales in a location that has undergone considerable warming in recent decades and is forecast to be a 'hotspot' for future warming. Plant and animal communities at 136 rocky reef sites around Tasmania (south-east Australia) were censused between 1992 and 1995, and again in 2006 and 2007. Despite evidence of major ecological changes before the period of study, reef communities appeared to remain relatively stable over the past decade. Multivariate analyses and univariate metrics of biotic communities revealed few changes with time, although some species-level responses could be interpreted as symptomatic of ocean warming. These included fishes detected in Tasmania only in recent surveys and several species with warmer water affinities that appeared to extend their distributions further south. The most statistically significant changes observed in species abundances, however, were not related to their biogeographical affinities. The majority of species with changing abundance possessed lower to mid-range abundances rather than being common, raising questions for biodiversity monitoring and management.

However, the increasing interferences by various types of human activities have made marine and coastal ecosystem under heavier pressure. With the rapid development of shipping industry, especially ship transportation of petroleum, accidental oil spills have been one example of the human pressure and constituted one of the biggest threats to marine ecosystem. Marine oil spill accidents have also brought huge economic losses to local fishery, aquaculture, tourism and etc. Therefore, it is important to forecast and cut the risk of marine accidental oil spills. This paper focuses on the probability for potential future oil spill accidents in Luoyuan Bay. Based on the predicted number of vessels in Luoyuan Bay in the future, we estimate the foundational probability of shipping accident and then forecast the probabilistic risk of oil spill accidents using methodologies of probability and mathematical statistics. By calculating the probability of oil spills from oil tankers of different tonnages, we also predict the spilled oil quantity at one time and its diffusion area. The results indicate that the foundational probability is 0.361x10(-4)/S in the next S years, and the probability of oil spills from vessels is 0.0925, implying that the oil spill accidents may occur almost once every 10 years. The possible spilled oil quantity at one time is 57.3 tons and the oil diffusion area may reach 0.64km(2) after one tidal cycle. Finally, we put forward some relevant measures for the risk prevention of oil spill accidents in Luoyuan Bay.

In particular, we studied the feasibility of scheduled transport services using a helicopter and a seaplane for rapidly connecting Sicily in the south of Italy to the near and very attractive Eolie Islands. In order to estimate the potential service demand, we allowed for the number of tourists arriving in the Eolie Archipelago during the period 1999-2008. In detail, we considered only the market of visitors with a high willingness-to-pay for time savings (individuals choosing superior hotels) coming from origins at least 300 km away from the Eolie Islands. Furthermore, we excluded a quota of travellers not disposed to flying, determined on the basis of a previous study about air transport demand. We also considered as potential users of the proposed transport services a percentage of the Eolie Isles' population that was set according to a recent study about the use of air transport by Sicilian residents. The resulting observations were employed to estimate forecasts through an ARIMA model. After a technical analysis to identify the types of helicopter and seaplane suited to implementing regular transport services, we performed a cost analysis concerning the proposed non-conventional air transport services (taking into account fixed, variable, trading and Financial costs). In particular, based on the ARIMA model demand forecasts, we determined the service supply (daily frequency and number of aircrafts) in the different cases and evaluated the related total cost per passenger. At the final step, we compared the helicopter and seaplane options with the various existing transport alternatives that can be used to get to the Eolie Islands from the major regional airport, according to generalized transport cost (calculated by adding the value of transit time, external costs and service fare). We found out that according to the generalized cost criterion, the helicopter is the best solution to connect the main Sicilian airport to the Eolie Isles.",,,,,"Castelluccio, Francesco/0000-0001-6026-3038",,,,,6,6,0,3,,,,1743-3541,,978-1-84564-434-5,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,,,2010,130,,,,,,251,266,,10.2495/ISLANDS100221,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,,,WOS:000281197700022,,,,,

Describing distribution and abundance is requisite to exploring interactions between organisms and their environment. Recently, the resource selection function (RSF) has emerged to replace many of the statistical procedures used to quantify resource selection by animals. 2. A RSF is defined by characteristics measured on resource units such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used by an organism. It is solved using a variety of techniques, particularly the binomial generalized linear model. 3. Observing dynamics in a RSF - obtaining substantially different functions at different times or places for the same species - alerts us to the varying ecological processes that underlie resource selection. 4. We believe that there is a need for us to reacquaint ourselves with ecological theory when interpreting RSF models. We outline a suite of factors likely to govern ecologically based variation in a RSF. In particular, we draw attention to competition and density-dependent habitat selection, the role of predation, longitudinal changes in resource availability and functional responses in resource use. 5. How best to incorporate governing factors in a RSF is currently in a state of development; however, we see promise in the inclusion of random as well as fixed effects in resource selection models, and matched case-control logistic regression. 6. Investigating the basis of ecological dynamics in a RSF will allow us to develop more robust models when applied to forecasting the spatial distribution of animals. It may also further our understanding of the relative importance of ecological interactions on the distribution and abundance of species.",,,,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ArcticWOLVES,"We thank Thierry Duchesne, Mark Boyce, the Editors and an anonymous referee for commenting on an earlier draft of this paper.

A standardized moisture index and other modeled hydrologic data were used in regression analyses to assess the relationship between antecedent subsurface moisture and streamflow. The relationship was found to be strongest during late spring and early summer, or the annual period of greatest runoff. During the warm runoff season of mid-summer through early fall it is the relationship between streamflow and monthly basin net water (the total of rain and snowmelt minus potential evaporation summed for the whole basin) that is strongest. The addition of subsurface moisture indices as independent regression variables increased the explained variance in streamflow by 30% for the more productive basin and by 14% for the other basin. Incorporation of the subsurface moisture indices in streamflow forecasts at lead times of two to five months increased the explained variance by 3% (5-month lead) to 19% (2-month lead).

Landscape-scale conservation planners need to dissect those 'threats' (human activities that have driven ecological processes beyond the range of natural variability) to understand exactly what anthropogenic activities are influencing which aspects of ecosystem pattern and process. This chapter reviews two aspects of land use/land cover change (disaggregated and aggregated transitions), and introduces other anthropogenic activities that are treated in more depth in other chapters (i.e., pollution, disease, and climate change) before describing an ecoregional threat assessment project focused on identifying, mapping, and forecasting 'keystone threats.' Keystone threats are those strongly-interacting human activities - e.g., land use/land cover change - that if captured and modeled with some degree of accuracy can provide insights into where and when to protect habitats. The chapter suggests that in more wild or pristine areas, pollution or disease may be keystone threats while land use/land cover change will be the primary driver of biodiversity loss elsewhere.

Long-term data sets from programs such as US-LTER provide a context to evaluate the pace of ecological change, to interpret its effects, and to forecast the range of future biological responses to change. The primary challenges for LTER type research during its history involved sustaining funding, partnership development to sustain growth, maintaining continuity in objectives, and linking scientists and data through communication and cooperation. These challenges have been successfully addressed over the decades of the US-LTER program through close cooperation and coordination of the scientific community and the funding agencies for these programs. The scientific community benefits much from working with colleagues around the world that have other experiences, social cultures, and knowledge bases. Ultimately, the mission of LTER and the International LTER Network is to incorporate understanding of the role of humans in the environment to inform policy makers and translate understanding into action. As the US-LTER Network approached its fourth successful decade of scientific achievement in the ecological sciences, it developed a scientific plan for the future to provide a unifying framework that proposes to understand how humans perceive the critical services provided by ecosystems at multiple human scales, how these perceptions change behavior and institutions, and how these changes in turn feed back to affect ecosystem structure and function and the ability of ecosystems to continue to deliver services over the long term.

Knowledge gained through these networks will be critical in understanding, detecting, and forecasting ecological changes that affect important ecological services upon which society depends. The networks will provide information necessary for societies to adapt to broad-scale changes such as those associated with land use, demographic, and climate change. Several new multi-tiered monitoring programs are being developed to evaluate ecological changes and associated drivers of change at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Additionally, existing ecological monitoring programs, such as the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, are attempting to improve their capacities to extrapolate results to larger spatial extents by developing a standard Set of measures or indicators and by facilitating cooperation among scientists within and among the various monitoring networks. Despite these attempts, several issues remain in integrating existing monitoring programs. We discuss these issues and review existing programs within a multi-tiered monitoring framework that explicitly incorporates citizen-based monitoring. Direct involvement of the public is seen as a critical element in expanding and maintaining existing and new ecological monitoring networks.

To help understand responses by EMPB to these variables and their interactions, EMPB was compared at 2 different latitudes in eastern Australia. In subtropical Brisbane and temperate Sydney, EMPB was sampled at 4 different heights on shores exposed to, or sheltered from, waves during the austral winters and summers of 2006 to 2008. Trends of increasing biomass with decreasing height on shore supported previous studies. In particular, the interaction between season and height was similar to results of previous studies in Australia. There were no differences in biomass of standing stock between Sydney and Brisbane. Differences in timing of sampling occasions confounded some comparisons, and some observed patterns may be due to differences in rates of recolonisation among treatments. Spectrometric assessment of the composition of pigments in EMPB differed with latitude. Spectral samples were more similar to those from assemblages of cyanobacteria than to assemblages of green algae, and this was more marked in Sydney than in Brisbane. Amounts of chlorophyll a were greater on sheltered shores than on those exposed to waves. These patterns are not easily explained, but serve to illustrate the difficulties of extrapolating patterns and processes from one area to another. Variations in pattern at different heights on the shore and in different years emphasise the need for spatially and temporally extensive data in order to make reliable predictions about EMPB. Improved capacity to make reliable predictions will help us understand how EMPB may respond to our changing climate, which is forecast to be hotter with more frequent storms.",,,,"Skilleter, Greg Alan/F-9250-2010","Skilleter, Greg Alan/0000-0002-4719-0409",Australian Research Council through the Centre for Research on Ecological Impacts of Coastal Cities (EICC)Australian Research Council; ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council,"The present study was supported by funds from the Australian Research Council through the Centre for Research on Ecological Impacts of Coastal Cities (EICC) and ARC Discovery Projects.

We used another approach, which circumvents the period of high egg and larval mortality, and instead improves forecasts from juvenile abundance indices. We compared several statistical recruitment forecast models and demonstrate that an increasing abundance of predators on juvenile walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma, particularly the arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, which now dominates the groundfish biomass in the Gulf of Alaska, and autocorrelation caused by intercohort interactions strongly affect pollock recruitment during the juvenile phase. Furthermore, the weight of predictor variables changes with threshold criteria, which are linked to phase shifts in the marine environment. Our results indicate that forecasting recruitment of marine fishes can be improved by considering factors that influence survival after the juvenile period, but also needs to account for changes in community structure and phase shifts in the environment, as opposed to only environmental correlates.

Striped bass YOY recruitment levels varied >11-fold in the 6 years examined. In those years, mean daily freshwater flows from the Susquehanna River to the bay in March and April varied >2-fold and controlled distribution and apparent survival of striped bass larvae. Strong recruitments of YOY striped bass were associated with matches in space and time of larval striped bass and high concentrations of zooplankton prey, especially the copepod Eurytemora affinis and cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. The strongest year classes (1996, 2003) were produced in years of high freshwater flow, characterized by a high abundance of feeding-stage larvae and a spatio-temporal match between peak abundance of larvae and zooplankton prey. Enhanced feeding opportunities were most pronounced in high freshwater-flow years (1996, 1998, 2003), when larvae and zooplankton prey were strongly associated with, and apparently retained near, the estuarine turbidity maximum. First-feeding larvae fed more successfully in a high-flow year (2003; prey incidence 91%) than in a drier year (2001; prey incidence 35%). A regression model that may have forecasting potential was developed to describe recruitment of YOY striped bass for the years from 1985 to 2006. The model includes spring freshwater flow and air temperatures to predict age-0 striped bass recruitment strength (R-2 = 0.65).

Populations of red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata in the NW Mediterranean Sea are threatened both by chronic and localized increases in mortality due to high diving activity and by widespread but episodic mass mortality events related to climatic anomalies. Using demographic data obtained from 3 populations (2 under contrasting levels of diving and one affected by a 1999 mass mortality event), we developed size-structured matrix models to forecast the long-term consequences of both disturbances and their combined effects. When we considered only the effects of diver damage, our results showed that population stability could be achieved with an increase in the annual survival of adult colonies of between 3 and 7%, demonstrating the need for diving reduction in the study locations, where there are estimated to be between 30000 and 70000 dives yr(-1). Modeling the effects of mass mortality events alone showed a low annual population growth rate (0.886) and near certain extinction risk over even short time scales. Considering these 2 types of impacts together, we found that the effects of mass mortality events aggravate the decline in gorgonian populations subjected to high diving impact, reaching the extinction threshold after 36 to 55 yr under the actual frequency of mass mortality events. Simulated reduction of diving effects dramatically increased the time to quasi-extinction for populations subjected to realistic frequencies of mass mortality events. Our simulations reveal the need of management actions to ensure the gorgonian viability in the face of climate change, and suggest that management of more controllable impacts, such as diving, can help buffer populations against the less controllable effects of climate change.",,,,"Linares, Cristina/A-5244-2018","Linares, Cristina/0000-0003-3855-2743","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of SpainSpanish Government [CGL-2007-6657-C02-01]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0087078, USDA 2002-00610]","We are grateful to R.

Taking a longitudinal approach of following cohorts over time, we evaluated evidence for mangrove-derived replenishment of 10 coral reef fishes by drawing on data from 2 concurrent fish monitoring efforts conducted in Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, over the period 1999 to 2007. Annual indices of abundance were calculated for fish estimated to be age-0 to 4* in both habitats, and correlation analyses, with appropriate temporal lags, were performed. Statistically significant (p < 0.05; r(2) = 0.30 to 0.71) correlations between juvenile abundances in mangrove habitats and adult abundances on the reef tract 1 to 2 yr later emerged for 4 species: Abudefduf saxatilis, Lutjanus apodos, L. griseus, and Sphyraena barracuda. This is one of the few longitudinal studies that uses juvenile abundance indices to test mangrove reef ontogenetic connectivity.

In this chapter, we discuss one possible mechanism that has not been widely studied, involving plant volatiles and using an aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) and one of its hosts (Hordeum vulgare L., barley) as test organisms. Volatiles from neighbouring plants of a different species or even from plants of the same species have been found to alter aphid acceptance of the receiving plant. Similar effects have been found earlier with volatiles from damaged plants, but here the volatile-emitting plants are apparently undamaged. In the majority of plant combinations tested, host acceptance is decreased but only when certain emitters are combined with certain receivers. Exposure of barley to volatiles from the common weeds Chenopodium album L., Cirsium spp. and Solanum nigrum L. resulted in reduced host acceptance by the aphid, but exposing barley to volatiles from many other weed species had no effect. The same was true for intra-specific interactions; only when certain barley genotypes were exposed to volatiles from specific barley genotypes did the aphids respond differently. Such induced effects correlated with aphid growth rates in a set of barley genotypes representing a wide range of host suitability to the aphid. Pedigree information suggested that the ability to become induced is heritable in barley, something that might be exploited in breeding. More crop/pest combinations should be investigated for these effects, and favourable interactions should be exploited in new cropping systems as plant mixtures or in monocultures with chemical elicitors applied according to forecasts of pest attacks.",,,,"Ahman, Inger/D-5672-2016; Ninkovic, Velemir/E-7677-2011","Ahman, Inger/0000-0003-4640-0918; Ninkovic, Velemir/0000-0001-9276-7169",,,,,2,2,0,5,,,,1867-9048,,978-3-642-12161-6,SIGNAL COMMUN PLANTS,Signal.

Adaptation to climate change is a necessity to reduce social vulnerability. The adoption of agricultural innovations presents a suitable strategy to reduce negative impacts of increased inter-annual variability in rainfall and temperature. Focussing on the dominant agroforestry system cacao in the Indonesian province of Central Sulawesi, we investigate the adaptation strategies of agricultural smallholders to El Nico-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related droughts. We apply a triangulation of Rapid Rural Appraisal Methods (RRA), semi-structured in-depth interviews and participatory observations. In addition, results from an intensive cacao-study (n=144) on yields, plot history, structure and location are used. The analysis shows that all interviewed households have been affected by extreme climatic effects such as ENSO related droughts which lead to a decline in agricultural outputs. Our study identifies various types of adaptation strategies on the micro level. Most common strategies are reactive or ex-post adaptations which support the household in coping with the effects of droughts. Further, the study assesses anticipatory adaptation strategies which, if precisely implemented, alter the household's exposure to future droughts, increase the resilience to cope with changes and reduce the degree of sensitivity of affected households. On the basis of these results we examine why different household types do not implement certain strategies, which could enhance their social resilience. In this context we reveal that the adoption of anticipatory adaptation strategies is strongly influenced by social and human capital. The knowledge transfer - which promotes adaptation - is mainly taking place along ethnic lines and local institutions. For the successful adoption of innovations to cope with ENSO related droughts in the study area, membership in certain ethnic groups, local institutions and networks is of utmost importance.",,,,"Schwarze, Stefan/P-7696-2019","Schwarze, Stefan/0000-0002-1672-1246; Faust, Heiko/0000-0003-0307-6943; Purnomo, Mangku/0000-0002-9023-1835",,,,,8,8,1,32,,,,1863-5520,,978-3-642-00492-6,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

However, there are few references in this field and no landmark research work has been reported, particularly quantitative research. A forecasting model for ecological security based on cellular automata (CA) was developed using preliminary spatial data from an ecological security assessment of Guangzhou conducted previously (1990-2005). The model was constrained using transformation rules based upon proposed planning for 2010-2020. A simulation accuracy of 72.09% was acquired. Using a one-bit assessment grid for 2005 as the starting state for the simulation, the model was used to forecast ecological security for 2020. This revealed that although the ecological security status would be improved relative to current trends, there would still be an overall decline in ecological security over the next 15 years. Even if new urban plans were implemented, landscape pattern analysis suggested a more scattered and homogenous distribution in the urban landscape of Guangzhou and significant variation in landscape characteristics among districts. This suggests that further measures must be adopted to reverse the current trends in Guangzhou's ecological security. The model highlights the need to make ecological protection an integral part of urban planning. This study demonstrates the potential of CA models for forecasting ecological security. Such models could make an important contribution to decision-making for regional governors and to the development of urban planning incorporating assessment and prediction of ecological security.

To address this issue, an international workshop was held at the University of Adelaide in Australia, 2529 May 2009, bringing leading species distribution and population modellers together with plant ecologists. Building on two previous workshops in the UK and Spain, the participants aimed to develop methodological standards and case studies for integrating bioclimatic and metapopulation models, to provide more realistic forecasts of population change, habitat fragmentation and extinction risk under climate change. The discussions and case studies focused on several challenges, including spatial and temporal scale contingencies, choice of predictive climate, land use, soil type and topographic variables, procedures for ensemble forecasting of both global climate and bioclimate models and developing demographic structures that are realistic and species-specific and yet allow generalizations of traits that make species vulnerable to climate change.

First, we modelled the current distributions and the potential future projections of 38 endemic or rare bird species. We used eight modelling techniques within the BIOMOD computational framework in an ensemble-forecasting approach to reach a consensus scenario. Then we compared current and future (2046-2060) distributions under different scenarios (reserve size and bird dispersal) with the current Brazilian reserve system to assess the adequacy of protection (representation) of each species and detect gaps in their protection. Finally, to identify areas with high probability of occurrence of several species, we calculated cumulative climatic suitability of all 38 species for both current and future scenarios. None of the 38 species is covered under any current or future scenarios, revealing that the current reserve system is highly inefficient in conserving the analyzed bird species. The implementation of new reserves to cover species in current and future climate scenarios is recommended in areas in the south-eastern part of the Cerrado region and in the mountains of east Brazil. Due to the already high land use of the southeast region of the Cerrado, the application of non-traditional conservation measures should be evaluated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Niche-based species distribution models offer a well-developed framework for assessing the potential range of species. However, these models assume equilibrium between the species' distribution and its ecological requirements. During range expansion, invasive species are not in such equilibrium due to both dispersal limitation and frequent casual occurrence in sites unsuitable to persistent populations. In this article we use the example of the invasive annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Austria to evaluate if model accuracy can be enhanced in such non-equilibrium situations by taking account of propagule pressure and by restricting model calibration to naturalized populations. Moreover, we test if model accuracy increases during invasion history using distribution data from 1984 to 2005. The results suggest that models calibrated with naturalized populations are much more accurate than those based on the total set of records. Proxies of propagule pressure slightly but significantly improve goodness of fit, accuracy, and Type I and II error rates of models calibrated with all available records but have less consistent effects on models of naturalized populations. Model accuracy did not increase during the recent invasion history, probably because the species is still far from an equilibrium distribution. We conclude that even a coarse assessment of population status with records of invasive species delivers important information for predictive modelling and that proxies of propagule pressure should be included into such models at least during early to intermediate stages of the invasion history.",,,,,"Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112",Austrian research programme AUSTROCLIM,"This work has been partially financed by funds from the Austrian research programme AUSTROCLIM.

We studied the potential impacts of predicted climate-driven change on the distribution and conservation of 26 broad-range birds from South America Cerrado biome (a savanna that also encompass tracts of grasslands and forests). We used 12 temperature or precipitation-related bioclimatic variables, nine niche modeling techniques, three general circulation models, and two climate scenarios (for 2030, 2065, 2099) for each species to model distribution ranges. To reach a consensus scenario, we used an ensemble-forecasting approach to obtain an average distribution for each species at each time interval. We estimated the range extent and shift of each species. Changes in range size varied across species and according to habitat dependency; future predicted range extent was negatively correlated with current predicted range extent in all scenarios. Evolution of range size under full or null dispersal scenarios varied among species from a 5% increase to an 80% decrease. The mean expected range shifts under null and full-dispersal scenarios were 175 and 200 km, respectively (range 15-399 km), and the shift was usually toward southeastern Brazil. We predicted larger range contractions and longer range shifts for forest-and grassland-dependent species than for savanna-dependent birds. A negative correlation between current range extent and predicted range loss revealed that geographically restricted species may face stronger threat and become even rarer. The predicted southeasterly direction of range changes is cause for concern because ranges are predicted to shift to the most developed and populated region of Brazil. Also, southeastern Brazil is the least likely region to contain significant dispersal corridors, to allow expansion of Cerrado vegetation types, or to accommodate creation of new reserves.",,,,"Marini, Miguel A/J-6251-2012; Lopes, Leonardo Esteves/B-5726-2013","Marini, Miguel A/0000-0002-7300-7321; Lopes, Leonardo Esteves/0000-0003-4014-9128",CAPESCAPES; FAPEMIGMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG),M.A.M. was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from CAPES and L.

Here, a novel approach to partition the variance among modeled attributes, such as richness or turnover, and map sources of uncertainty in ensembles of forecasts is presented. We model the distributions of 3837 New World birds and project them into 2080. We then quantify and map the relative contribution of different sources of uncertainty from alternative methods for niche modeling, general circulation models (AOGCM), and emission scenarios. The greatest source of uncertainty in forecasts of species range shifts arises from using alternative methods for niche modeling, followed by AOGCM, and their interaction.

Therefore, predicting ecological responses to these chronic resource alterations will require the modification of existing disturbance-based frameworks. Here, we present a conceptual framework for assessing the nature and pace of ecological change under chronic resource alterations. The ""hierarchical-response framework'' (HRF) links well-documented, ecological mechanisms of change to provide a theoretical basis for testing hypotheses to explain the dynamics and differential sensitivity of ecosystems to chronic resource alterations. The HRF is based on a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms and responses beginning with individual (physiological/metabolic) responses, followed by species reordering within communities, and finally species loss and immigration. Each mechanism is hypothesized to differ in the magnitude and rate of its effects on ecosystem structure and function, with this variation depending on ecosystem attributes, such as longevity of dominant species, rates of biogeochemical cycling, levels of biodiversity, and trophic complexity. Overall, the HRF predicts nonlinear changes in ecosystem dynamics, with the expectation that interactions with natural disturbances and other global-change drivers will further alter the nature and pace of change. The HRF is explicitly comparative to better understand differential sensitivities of ecosystems, and it can be used to guide the design of coordinated, cross-site experiments to enable more robust forecasts of contemporary and future ecosystem dynamics.",,,,"Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008; Smith, Melinda D/J-8987-2014; Collins, Scott/Y-6888-2019","Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892",DOE PEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DEFG02- 04ER63892]; NSF LTERNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0435546],"We thank B.

These more extreme rainfall patterns are characterized by increased event size separated by longer within season drought periods and represent novel climatic conditions whose consequences for different ecosystem types are largely unknown. Here, we present results from an experiment in which more extreme rainfall patterns were imposed in three native grassland sites in the Central Plains Region of North America, USA. Along this 600 km precipitation-productivity gradient, there was strong sensitivity of temperate grasslands to more extreme growing season rainfall regimes, with responses of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) contingent on mean soil water levels for different grassland types. At the mesic end of the gradient (tallgrass prairie), longer dry intervals between events led to extended periods of below-average soil water content, increased plant water stress and reduced ANPP by 18%. The opposite response occurred at the dry end (semiarid steppe), where a shift to fewer, but larger, events increased periods of above-average soil water content, reduced seasonal plant water stress and resulted in a 30% increase in ANPP. At an intermediate mixed grass prairie site with high plant species richness, ANPP was most sensitive to more extreme rainfall regimes (70% increase). These results highlight the inherent complexity in predicting how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to forecast novel climate conditions as well as the difficulties in extending inferences from single site experiments across biomes. Even with no change in annual precipitation amount, ANPP responses in a relatively uniform physiographic region differed in both magnitude and direction in response to within season changes in rainfall event size/frequency.",,,,"Blair, John M/I-4082-2014; Noojipady, Praveen/B-2511-2010; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008","Blair, John M/0000-0003-0072-0721; ",Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research program; Shortgrass Steppe Long-Term Ecological Research program; EPA STAR FellowshipUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"The authors thank M.

As a result, climate change is expected to have a profound effect on organisms and ecosystems. However, the impacts of weather and climate are frequently modified by multiple nonclimatic factors. Therefore, the role of these nonclimatic factors needs to be examined in order to understand and predict future change. Marine intertidal ecosystems are exposed to heat extremes during warm, sunny, midday low tides. Thus, the timing of low tide, a nonclimatic factor, determines the potential contact intertidal invertebrates and algae have with heat extremes. We developed a method that quantifies the daily risk of high temperature extremes in the marine intertidal using solar elevations and spatially continuous tidal predictions. The frequency of 'risky days' is variable over time and space along the Pacific Coast of North America. Results show that at some sites the percentage of risky days in June can vary by 30% across years. In order to do a detailed analysis, we selected San Francisco as a study site. In San Francisco, May is the month with the greatest frequency of risky days, even though September is the month with the greatest frequency of high air temperature, >= 30 degrees C. These results indicate that marine intertidal organisms can be protected from high temperature extremes due to the timing of tides and local weather patterns. In addition, annual fluctuations in tides influence the frequency of intertidal zone exposures to high temperature extremes. Peaks in risk for heat extremes in the intertidal zone occur every 18 years, the length of the tidal epoch. These results suggest that nonclimatic variables can complicate predictions of shifts in species ranges due to climate change, but that mechanistic approaches can be used to produce predictions that include these factors.",,,,"Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019; Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Smith, Allison/0000-0002-0761-0480; Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414",NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNG04GE43G]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA04NOS4780264],"We thank Kyle Aveni-Deforge, James Hench, and Joshua Cooper for assistance and advice at various stages of this project.

The algorithm requires the irregular directional wave spectra as input. This oceanographic data set is generated using the satellite data provided by the meteorological department. There are a number of different approaches to calculate the shortest path/route between two nodes representing the start and destination ports. In this work, the Dijkstra's algorithm which is based on the application of optimal control theory and dynamic programming techniques has been applied to obtain reliable optimum routing in random sea state. Loss of speed of a vessel in a seaway is not always due to the additional resistance in waves: the speed is often voluntarily reduced in order to decrease the violent heaving and pitching motions of the ship. In this ship routing algorithm, both speed loss due to wave resistance and voluntary speed reduction to control the motion, have been considered for the path finding algorithm.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0972-9984,0973-7308,,INT J ECOL DEV,Int.

To ensure the successful detection, control and eradication of invasive plant species, we need information that can identify areas prone to invasions and criteria that can point out which particular populations may become foci of further spread. Specifically, our work aimed to develop statistical models that identify hotspots of invasive plant species and evaluate the conditions that give rise to successful populations of invasive species. 2. We combined extensive data sets on invasive species richness and on species per cent ground cover, together with climate, local habitat and land cover data. We then estimated invasive species richness as a function of those environmental variables by developing a spatially explicit generalized linear model within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In a second analysis, we used an ordinal logistic regression model to quantify invasive species abundance as a function of the same set of predictor variables. 3. Our results show which locations in the studied region, north-eastern USA, are prone to plant species invasions given the combination of climatic and land cover conditions particular to the sites. Predictions were also generated under a range of climate scenarios forecasted for the region, which pointed out at an increase in invasive species incidence under the most moderate forecast. Predicted abundance for some of the most common invasive plant species, Berberis thumbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, Euonymus alata, Elaeagnus umbellata and Rosa multiflora, allowed us to identify the specific conditions that promote successful population growth of these species, populations that could become foci of further spread. 4.Synthesis and applications. Reliable predictions of plants' invasive potential are crucial for the successful implementation of control and eradication management plans. By following a multivariate approach the parameters estimated in this study can now be used on targeted locations to evaluate the risk of invasions given the local climate and landscape structure; they can also be applied under different climate scenarios and changing landscapes providing an array of possible outcomes. In addition, this modelling approach can be easily used in other regions and for other species.",,,,"Wilson, Adam/C-6731-2009","Wilson, Adam/0000-0003-3362-7806","U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2005-02217, 2006-38914-03519, 2008-35616-19014, 2008-38914-19167]","We thank A.

We used a controlled drying experiment to investigate the resistance of populations of 2 crayfish species (Procambarus fallax and Procambarus alleni) found in south Florida wetlands in 3 sediment types (sand, marl, and peat). The species had different putative burrowing abilities, and we tested the hypothesis that the severity of drying disturbance for populations of burrowing crayfish would be species and substrate dependent. Observations of initial burrowing success indicated that the species could burrow equally well in peat, whereas P. alleni burrowed more effectively than P. fallax in marl and sand. No P. fallax burrowed in the dense sand substrate. The number of crayfish surviving 2 mo underground was a function of particular combinations of species and substrate. Survival of both species was high in peat (similar to 66%) and similarly high for P. alleni in marl. Survival of P. fillax in marl was considerably lower (31%), and no P. fallax survived in sand. Despite their initial burrowing success, only a few P. alleni survived in the sand in shallow burrows. Survivors of both species showed some loss of body mass from initial conditions, but P. fallax lost relatively more mass. The substrate-specific survival of P. fallax helps explain their persistence at relatively high densities in peat-dominated wetlands that dry every 1 to 3 y and their small populations in marl-dominated marshes with similar drying frequencies. Attempts to explain or forecast the net effects of wetland drying for crayfish populations and other burrowing animals should consider that resistance to drying disturbances will depend on characteristics of both species and substrate types. These considerations have important implications for hydrological restoration of aquatic ecosystems that have pronounced gradients of hydrology and substrates.",,,,,,South Florida Water Management District and Florida Atlantic University [9500005560],"We are grateful for the help of R.

Yet, the degree to which inferences based on single species can be extended to whole communities is not fully understood. We used a pristine and spatially structured community of three landlocked salmonids (Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmo salar, and Salvelinus alpinus) from Gros Morne National Park (Newfoundland, Canada) to test several predictions on the interacting effects of landscape and life history variation on genetic diversity, neutral divergence, and gene flow (m, migration rate). Landscape factors consistently influenced multispecies genetic patterns: (i) waterfalls created strong dichotomies in genetic diversity and divergence between populations above and below them in all three salmonids; (ii) contemporary m decreased with waterway distance in all three species, while neutral genetic divergence (theta) increased with waterway distance, albeit in only two taxa; (iii) river flow generally produced downstream-biased m between populations when waterfalls separated these, but not otherwise. In contrast, we expected differential life history to result in a hierarchy of neutral divergence (S. salar > S. fontinalis > S. alpinus) based on disparities in dispersal abilities and population size from previous mark-recapture studies. Such hierarchy additionally matched varying degrees of spatial genetic structure among species revealed through individual-based analyses. We conclude that, whereas key landscape attributes hold power to predict multispecies genetic patterns in equivalent communities, they are likely to interact with species-specific life history attributes such as dispersal, demography, and ecology, which will in turn affect holistic conservation strategies.",,,,"Gomez-Uchida, Daniel/AAB-7043-2019","Gomez-Uchida, Daniel/0000-0002-5150-2030",Parks Canada Ecological Integrity; Innovation and Leadership Fund (PC-EIILF); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; PC-EIILF,"We would like to thank Parks Canada's scientist S.

While the high economic and conservation burden of this species makes accurate predictions of future invasions a research priority, forecasting is confounded by limited data, tenuous model assumptions, and the stochasticity of the invasion process. Using a new method for niche identification, we profiled invasion vulnerability for 1,017 lakes in the Great Lakes region of the Unites States. We used a nonparametric geoadditive regression model to test for effects of two water quality variables on the present distribution of zebra mussels. We then used the support vector data description (SVDD), a support vector machine for one-class classification, to estimate the boundary of the ecological niche. By disentangling niche estimation from distributional assumptions, computational niche models could be used to test an array of fundamental concepts in ecology and evolution, while species invasions forecasting is representative of the wide range of potential applications for niche identification in conservation and management.",,,,"Bossenbroek, Jonathan/C-9184-2012; Bossenbroek, Jonathan/F-3664-2011; Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235",National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; University of Toledo; Department of Environmental Sciences and Lake Erie Center; University of Georgia; Odum School of Ecology,"This research was conducted while JMD was a postdoctoral fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (Santa Barbara, California, USA).

Here we present an analysis of the spring phenological response to climate variation of twelve taxa: six plants, three birds, a frog, and two insects. Phenology was monitored using standardized protocols at 176 meteorological stations in Japan and South Korea from 1953 to 2005, and in some cases even longer. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the complex interactions of temperature, site effects, and latitude on phenology. Results show species-specific variation in the magnitude and even in the direction of their responses to increasing temperature, which also differ from site-to-site. At most sites the differences in phenology among species are forecast to become greater with warmer temperatures. Our results challenge the assertion that trends in one geographic region can be extrapolated to others, and emphasize the idiosyncratic nature of the species response to global warming. Field studies are needed to determine how these patterns of variation in species response to climate change affect species interactions and the ability to persist in a changing climate.

They also exhibit substantial variability among individuals in traits such as size, age, condition, and disease status that have large impacts on individual fates and consequently on the future of the population. We present here methods for constructing and analyzing a stochastic integral projection model (IPM) incorporating both of these forms of variability, illustrated through a case study of the monocarpic thistle Carlina vulgaris. We show how model construction can exploit the close correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of trait-fate relationships in a ""mixed"" or ""hierarchical"" models framework. This correspondence means that IPMs can be parameterized straightforwardly from data using established statistical techniques and software (vs. the largely ad hoc methods for stochastic matrix models), properly accounting for sampling error and between-year sample size variation and with vastly fewer parameters than a conventional stochastic matrix model. We show that the many tools available for analyzing stochastic matrix models (such as stochastic growth rate, lambda(S), small variance approximations, elasticity/sensitivity analysis, and life table response experiment [LTRE] analysis) can be used for IPMs, and we give computational formulas for elasticity/sensitivity analyses. We develop evolutionary analyses based on the connection between growth rate sensitivity and selection gradients and present a new method using techniques from functional data analysis to study the evolution of function-valued traits such as size-dependent flowering probability. For Carlina we found consistent selection against variability in both state-specific transition rates and the fitted functions describing state dependence in demographic rates. For most of the regression parameters de. ning the IPM there was also selection against temporal variance; however, in some cases the effects of nonlinear averaging were big enough to favor increased temporal variation. The LTRE analysis identified year-to-year variation in survival as the dominant factor in population growth variability. Evolutionary analysis of flowering strategy showed that the entire functional relationship between plant size and flowering probability is at or near an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) shaped by the size-specific trade-off between the benefit (fecundity) and cost (mortality) of flowering in a temporally varying environment.",,,,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0326705]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/A/S/2002/00940],"Research support was provided by NSF grant OCE 0326705 in the NSF/NIH Ecology of Infectious Diseases program (to S.

We specifically assess projected range changes in relation to the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) network and assess the possible consequences for conservation. Location South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Methods The newly emerging ensemble modelling approach is used with 50 species, four climate change models for the period 2070-2100 and eight bioclimatic niche models in the statistical package biomod. Model evaluation is done using the receiver operating characteristic and the recently introduced true skill statistic. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have full dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A consensus forecast is identified using principal components analysis. This forecast is interpreted in terms of the IBA network. An irreplaceability analysis is used to highlight priority IBAs for conservation attention in terms of climate change. Results The majority of species (62%) are predicted to lose climatically suitable space. Five species lose at least 85% of their climatically suitable space. Many IBAs lose species (41%; 47 IBAs) and show high rates of species turnover of more than 50% (77%; 95 IBAs). Highly irreplaceable regions for endemic species become highly localized under climate change, meaning that the endemic species analysed here experience similar range contractions to maintain climate niches. Main conclusions The South African IBAs network is likely to become less effective for conserving endemic birds under climate change. The irreplaceability analysis identified key refugia for endemic species under climate change, but many of these areas are not currently IBAs. In addition, many of these high-priority areas that are IBAs fall outside the current formal protected areas network.",,,,"van Rensburg, Berndt/A-4154-2009; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Erasmus, Barend/G-3411-2012; Robertson, Mark/A-5640-2011","van Rensburg, Berndt/0000-0002-5274-5536; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Erasmus, Barend/0000-0003-1869-8091; Coetzee, Bernard/0000-0002-9913-6295",EUEuropean Union (EU) [044399],"We thank the Avian Demography Unit, University of Cape Town for providing the bird atlas data; the numerous volunteers who contributed to its collection; Francois Engelbrecht for CCAM data, the South African Ecological Observations Network for other climate change data; Malcolm Ridges for access to C-Plan; and David Currie, Katrin Bohning-Gaese and two anonymous referees for insightful comments.

However, the static snapshot of EF accounting is not designed to make projections of future sustainability consequences, which fails to elicit policy implications from a dynamic, temporally explicit perspective. This work attempts to incorporate system dynamics (SD) into EF to develop a dynamic EF forecasting framework, and provide a platform to support policy making for urban sustainability improvement. SD is firstly adopted to model the dynamics and interactions of EF driving forces, and then incorporated into the EF framework by correlating system drivers to EF-related consumption categories, embodied EF is finally calculated using the compound-based method. Based on different policy feasibility and sustainability targets, four policy scenarios are designed to explore future sustainability prospects and formulate integrated policies which would attain that sustainability scenario. The modeling procedure is applied to a case study area to illustrate how it works, and policy making for urban sustainability can hopefully be supported using this developed framework in the near future.

Freshwater ecosystems, namely reservoirs, are particularly sensitive to land use changes. In this context, modelling can be very useful, for decision support, as an investigative tool to forecast the outcome of various scenarios, to guide current management in order to meet future targets and to develop integrated frameworks for management accordingly to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic Stochastic-Dynamic Methodology (StDM), coupled with a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in capturing how expected changes at land use level will alter the ecological status of lentic ecosystems, namely at physicochemical and biological levels. The methodology was applied to Portuguese reservoirs located in the Douro's basin and illustrated with a series of stochastic-dynamic and spatial outputs taking into account expected scenarios regarding land use changes. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the tool reliability in capturing the stochastic environmental dynamics of the selected metrics facing spatial explicit scenarios. The ultimate goal was to couple monitoring assessment and the described modelling techniques to ease management and decision making regarding the practical implementation of the WFD, both at the scale of the reservoir body and at the scale of the respective river watershed dynamics.

In this study we examined the threat posed to hemlock Tsuga canadensis forests by an invasive insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid Adelges tsugae (HWA). Our main objective was to determine if paleo-ecological pollen records, showing the response of tree genera to a previous Tsuga decline, could predict contemporary responses to the HWA. To assess this, we matched fossil pollen sites from the Global Pollen Database to sites in the northeastern US that were invaded by the HWA approximately two decades ago. Our analyses showed that several of the same genera responded positively to Tsuga declines at both fossil pollen and contemporary sites. We then applied this methodology to an area currently threatened by the HWA, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), where invasions began just seven years ago. Our analysis suggests that the canopy genera mostly likely to respond positively to declining hemlock abundances in GSMNP are Acer, Betula, Fagus, and Quercus. Our findings provide land managers in GSMNP with the first predictions of likely shifts in canopy composition. We expect that this methodology will have application at other areas threatened by the HWA.

This information can then be incorporated into strategies to more accurately model climate change impacts on species or to estimate future extinction risks. We examined the impact of increased temperatures on the longevity and dynamics of the persistent soil seed banks of eight ephemeral species from arid Australia. We found that the predicted global temperature increases under climate change will be reflected in increased soil temperatures, and that seeds in the soil seed bank will be exposed to long durations of high temperatures over the summer months. Three of the eight species studied had significantly greater levels of germination after exposure to predicted increased soil temperatures. Another species displayed a dramatic decrease in seed viability after such exposure. The capacity of such species to use the seed bank to bet hedge against rainfall events that cause germination but are insufficient to allow plant maturation, is compromised by increased germinability and subsequent loss or reduction of seed bank persistence. These predicted changes in the dynamics of soil seed banks increase the risk of local extinctions of these species, while the composition of the community may be altered by changes in species abundance. Our results show that the risk spreading mechanism provided by persistent seed banks could be compromised by the mechanistic impact of forecast temperature increases in arid habitats, and highlight the need to understand mechanisms that control population dynamics when attempting to address likely future impacts of climate change on biodiversity.",,,,"Denham, Andrew/E-3545-2012; Ooi, Mark K J/A-4779-2012","Denham, Andrew/0000-0002-8375-2747; Ooi, Mark K J/0000-0002-3046-0417; Auld, Tony/0000-0002-8766-2829",,,,,79,82,2,92,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Calluna-dominated heaths occur throughout Europe but are in decline across their range. There is growing interest in using prescribed burning for their management, but environmental and social change will impact future. re regimes. Understanding. re behaviour is vital for the sustainable use of. re, but no robust models exist to inform management. 2. Shrub fuels display complex. re behaviour. This is particularly true in UK moorlands which are unusual in their fuel structure and moisture regime, being dominated by live fuel and an oceanic climate. 3. We burnt 27 experimental. res in the Scottish uplands during the legal burning season using a replicated experimental design. Plots were assigned to one of three commonly identified growth phases. We estimated a range of prefire fuel characteristics, including heterogeneity in fuel structure. We recorded wind speed and direction and estimated rate of spread (RoS). 4. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate the relationship between. re behaviour parameters as a whole and control variables. Fuel structure and heterogeneity, wind speed and canopy fuel moisture content were strongly related to variation in. re behaviour. 5. Best subsets regression was used to generate models of. re spread based on wind speed, vegetation height, canopy fuel moisture and an index of fuel heterogeneity. RoS was determined largely by wind speed, but this interacted strongly with vegetation structure. Changes in fuel horizontal continuity and vertical structure reduced rates of spread in low wind speeds. 6. Synthesis and applications. Live fuel moisture and fuel heterogeneity play an important role in dampening. re behaviour, aspects of shrub fuels that have previously not been examined in detail. Careful use of. re for moorland management increases habitat diversity and creates. re-safe landscapes. Escaped prescribed. res burn large areas, homogenize landscapes and have severe impacts on ecosystem services. The complex relationship between fuel structure and wind speed implies that changes in behaviour can be rapid and unexpected. Models can be used to assess. re hazard prior to prescribed burning and to choose fuels that can be burnt safely under prevailing or forecast conditions.",,,,,,"Scottish Government through the Scottish Wildfire Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage, The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council","Research was funded by the Scottish Government through the Scottish Wildfire Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage, The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Natural Environment Research Council.
