Again, they do this using already existing data and nothing forecasted or the AR term alone. So - like many things, I would argue this is not a forecast. I mean, I could do the same thing and use my 2017 ebullition TS model and then in 2018 heat up the sediments, increasing overall ebullition, and show that the AR model from 2017 does not predict ebullition well in 2018 because of this forced step-trend I initialted.

Meanwhile, the model needs further revision to improve the fit with observed disease progress. We are currently attempting to modify the model for developing a panicle blast prediction model by adding some
