(e.g. memory mechanisms) I ran this by D, a psychologist who knows a few things about memory and perception and she had MANY thoughts (none very good) about how they approached this.  This is a really interesting case study because it is almost parameterizing the forecast horizon using NDVI data from the past, averaging it over the 2mo, 4mo, and 6mo, time periods, and then making that a momeory mechanism to predict where they would go. It is almost like their forecast model was how we might think of a null model to test how differnet memory times from Zebras could predict their location. So, it is almost like a spatial forecast that really does not have an exact horizon. This is how I read it at least...","yes; annual forecast of zebra migration (No - 2-6 month forecast horizons testing zebra memory)",NA,"No, I do not think this should be included as a forecasting paper.
