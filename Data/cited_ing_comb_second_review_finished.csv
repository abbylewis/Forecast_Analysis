107,MESOSCALE MODEL EXPERIMENTAL FORECASTS OF THE HAAR OF NORTHEAST SCOTLAND,A mesoscale model is used to simulate the diurnal evolution of sea fog off the northeast Scottish coast observed on 27 April 1984. It is shown that the accuracy of the early part of the forecast is very dependent on the specification of the initial conditions. If the initial description of the fog is sufficiently good the model can accurately erode it during the day and reform it in the following evening. The dependence of the accuracy of the forecasts on vertical resolution is also discussed.,https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1991)119<2107:MMEFOT>2.0.CO;2,"BALLARD, SP; GOLDING, BW; SMITH, RNB",1991,Article,Mon.

244,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN VARIATIONS IN MARINE FISH CULTURE ZONE,"Extensive field measurements aimed at studying short-term dissolved oxygen (DO) variability have been carried out in a marine fish culture zone in Hong Kong. A dynamic oxygen budget model is developed to analyze the diurnal water-quality data from a series of 26-hr surveys. The model formulation includes phytoplankton dynamics and photosynthetic production, sediment oxygen demand (SOD), fish respiration, carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxidation. and atmospheric oxygen transfer. The model is used to determine the components of oxygen consumption and production-in particular, the SOD and carbon-to-chlorophyll (CCHL) ratio. It is found that SOD and algal respiration are major oxygen consumption items, and the CCHL ratio is much higher than reported in previous mathematical model studies. Simulations of the diurnal DO variation are compared with data over a wide range of meteorological and ecological conditions. The model interpretation provides a basis for the formulation of a water-quality model for short-term DO forecasts",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1991)117:6(799),"LEE, JHW; WU, RSS; CHEUNG, YK; WONG, PPS",1991,Article,J.

326,TIME-SERIES FORECASTING USING NEURAL NETWORKS VS BOX-JENKINS METHODOLOGY,"We discuss the results of a comparative study of the performance of neural networks and conventional methods in forecasting time series. Our work was initially inspired by previously published works that yielded inconsistent results about comparative performance. We have experimented with three time series of different complexity using different feed forward, backpropagation neural network models and the standard Box-Jenkins model. Our experiments demonstrate that for time series with long memory, both methods produced comparable results. However, for series with short memory, neural networks outperformed the Box-Jenkins model. We note that some of the comparable results arise since the neural network and time series model appear to be functionally similar models. We have found that for time series of different complexities there are optimal neural network topologies and parameters that enable them to learn more efficiently. Our initial conclusions are that neural networks are robust and provide good long-term forecasting. They are also parsimonious in their data requirements. Neural networks represent a promising alternative for forecasting, but there are problems determining the optimal topology and parameters for efficient learning.",https://doi.org/10.1177/003754979105700508,"TANG, ZY; DEALMEIDA, C; FISHWICK, PA",1991,Article,Simulation,English,rachel corrigan,NA,1,0,1,NA,,,NA
332,FORECASTING OF DISSOLVED-OXYGEN IN MARINE FISH CULTURE ZONE,"Short-term trends in dissolved oxygen in a weakly flushed marine fish culture zone in Hong Kong are studied by a real-time water-quality model with seven system variables: dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate, zooplankton, and sediment algal carbon. The carbon-chlorophyll ratio is computed as a function of a time-variable saturating light intensity. Sediment oxygen demand is related to organic loads from the fish farm as well as algal biomass. Water-quality predictions are compared with well-documented field observations for both background and algal bloom conditions, over time scales on the order of a month. Model simulations demonstrate the importance of light intensity and photosynthetic production in dissolved oxygen variations, which are well predicted. The model also provides useful insights into the causes of severe oxygen depletion and phytoplankton dynamics in a eutrophic subtropical coastal marine ecosystem.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1991)117:6(816),"LEE, JHW; WU, RSS; CHEUNG, YK",1991,Article,J.

195,HAYMAKING - RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN CENTRAL PYRENEES GRASSLANDS,"The drying of forage is subject to climatic risks. Climatic opportunities, in particular the number of field working days, need to be taken into consideration in the management of haymaking and the choice of harvesting equipment. Furthermore, the farmer's behaviour in response to short range weather forecasts and the uncertainty as to the drying requirements of a given forage should be taken into account. The authors propose to model drying opportunities and drying requirements according to the air saturation deficit sum. Drying requirements depend especially on the water content of the herbage. It is shown that drying requirements vary greatly from year to year. Paddocks with the higher yields have the greatest drying requirements. At a given date, the area cut depends not only on the forage characteristics but also on harvesting strategies (lapping or not of some paddocks) and on farmer behaviour in response to the weather forecast and forage drying requirements. The area cut at a given date is simulated according to these different assumptions and it is shown that the time needed for haymaking can fluctuate by about a month within one year. Haymaking strategy and behaviour towards the drying requirement of the forage are the most important. The results are compared with field data from different farmers over a range of years. The authors suggest, a process to integrate risk and uncertainty situations in respect of the choice of hay harvesting equipment and in respect of daily haymaking management. Also proposed are indicators with which to observe a set of decision making rules (risk level, the order in which to harvest paddocks).",https://doi.org/10.1016/0308-521X(92)90040-U,"DURU, M; COLOMBANI, H",1992,Article,Agric.

178,PRECISION OF RECRUITMENT PREDICTIONS FROM EARLY LIFE STAGES OF MARINE FISHES,"To test the hypothesis that year-class strength in marine fishes is determined in the early-larval stages, and that these stages can be used to predict recruitment, I modeled the recruitment process using a modified form of key-factor analysis. Using data compiled from the fish literature, I found a significant relationship (R2 0.90, p much less than 0.001, n 97) between the mean and interannual variance of stage-specific mortality rates that provided variance estimates for the model. The R2 values for the true correlation between abundances of small larvae and subsequent recruitment for four example species of marine fish were predicted to lie between 0.10 and 0.57, depending on the assumptions of the model. I therefore suggest that recruitment levels are fixed after the early-larval period. However, the precision of sample correlations are too low (10-yr data series) to empirically test whether abundances or mortality rates of early larvae are in reality strongly or poorly correlated with recruitment. After metamorphosis, the strength of the true relationship and the precision of sample correlations increase sufficiently to permit precise forecasting of recruitment. Recruitment is a complex process in which variation in all life stages contributes substantially to the variability in final abundance; therefore, researchers should recognize the importance of the later prerecruit stages and the interactions among all stages.",NA,"BRADFORD, MJ",1992,Article,Fish.

305,FORECASTING OF REFERENCE CROP EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,"The first step in the determination of irrigation water requirements for use in project planning, design, and operation commonly involves the prediction of the reference crop evapotranspiration. This paper presents a simple mathematical model for forecasting reference crop evapotranspiration at three stations in California that represent humid, semi-arid, and arid weather conditions, covering three extremes in the California climate. A time domain-time series model is identified for the reference crop evapotranspiration data at each of the sites and compared to other simple methods of forecasting using monthly average and yearly difference approaches. Based on the results of model comparisons it is concluded that a generalized time series model can be used to forecast reference crop evapotranspiration at each of the stations, and that the time series model can provide a reasonably accurate, yet simple method of forecasting reference crop evapotranspiration in many agricultural areas of California.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3774(93)90022-3,"MARINO, MA; TRACY, JC; TAGHAVI, SA",1993,Article,Agric.

84,WHAT IS A GOOD FORECAST - AN ESSAY ON THE NATURE OF GOODNESS IN WEATHER FORECASTING,"Differences of opinion exist among forecasters-and between forecasters and users-regarding the meaning of the phrase ''good (bad) weather forecasts.'' These differences of opinion are fueled by a lack of clarity and/or understanding concerning the nature of goodness in weather forecasting. This lack of clarity and understanding complicates the processes of formulating and evaluating weather forecasts and undermines their ultimate usefulness. Three distinct types of goodness are identified in this paper: 1) the correspondence between forecasters' judgments and their forecasts (type 1 goodness, or consistency), 2) the correspondence between the forecasts and the matching observations (type 2 goodness, or quality), and 3) the incremental economic and/or other benefits realized by decision makers through the use of the forecasts (type 3 goodness, or value). Each type of goodness is defined and described in some detail. In addition, issues related to the measurement of consistency, quality, and value are discussed. Relationships among the three types of goodness are also considered. It is shown by example that the level of consistency directly impacts the levels of both quality and value. Moreover, recent studies of quality/value relationships have revealed that these relationships are inherently nonlinear and may not be monotonic unless the multifaceted nature of quality is respected. Some implications of these considerations for various practices related to operational forecasting are discussed. Changes in these practices that could enhance the goodness of weather forecasts in one or more respects are identified.",https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1993)008<0281:WIAGFA>2.0.CO;2,"MURPHY, AH",1993,Article,Weather Forecast.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,0,0,NA,,,NA
387,IS THERE CHAOS IN PLANKTON DYNAMICS,"A controversial issue in ecosystem modeling is whether the irregular fluctuations that one observes in nature are due solely to random environmental factors or whether, at least partially, a deterministic mechanism is responsible for the unpredictable behavior. This second alternative is called deterministic chaos and the issue in this paper is to decide if actual plankton time series can vindicate the hypothesis of chaotic dynamics. The near-neighbor forecasting method is a recent technique for detecting determinism in a time series and we apply it to measurements of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass obtained at a single station in the Middle Atlantic Bight. Although the results do not conclude the presence of chaos, they do give some support to the idea that deterministic non-linear trophic dynamics may account for at least some of the variability that is seen in the data, particularly in terms of inferring zooplankton oscillations from those of phytoplankton.",https://doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.6.603,"ASCIOTI, FA; BELTRAMI, E; CARROLL, TO; WIRICK, C",1993,Article,J.

281,JOINT ESTIMATION OF MODEL PARAMETERS AND OUTLIER EFFECTS IN TIME-SERIES,"Time series data are often subject to uncontrolled or unexpected interventions, from which various types of outlying observations are produced. Outliers in time series, depending on their nature, may have a moderate to significant impact on the effectiveness of the standard methodology for time series analysis with respect to model identification, estimation, and forecasting. In this article we use an iterative outlier detection and adjustment procedure to obtain joint estimates of model parameters and outlier effects. Four types of outliers are considered, and the issues of spurious and masking effects are discussed. The major differences between this procedure and those proposed in earlier literature include (a) the types and effects of outliers are obtained based on less contaminated estimates of model parameters, (b) the outlier effects are estimated simultaneously using multiple regression, and (c) the model parameters and the outlier effects are estimated jointly. The sampling behavior of the test statistics for cases of small to large sample sizes is investigated through a simulation study. The performance of the procedure is examined over a representative set of outlier cases. We find that the proposed procedure performs well in terms of detecting outlets and obtaining unbiased parameter estimates. An example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed procedure. It is demonstrated that this procedure performs effectively in avoiding spurious outliers and masking effects. The model parameter estimates obtained from the proposed procedure are typically very close to those estimated by the exact maximum likelihood method using an intervention model to incorporate the outliers.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2290724,"CHEN, C; LIU, LM",1993,Article,J.

137,NONLINEAR FORECASTING FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF NATURAL TIME-SERIES,"There is a growing trend in the natural sciences to view time series as products of dynamical systems. This viewpoint has proven to be particularly useful in stimulating debate and insight into the nature of the underlying generating mechanisms. Here I review some of the issues concerning the use of forecasting in the detection of nonlinearities and possible chaos, particularly with regard to stochastic chaos. Moreover, it is shown how recent attempts to measure meaningful Lyapunov exponents for ecological data are fundamentally flawed, and that when observational noise is convolved with process noise, computing Lyapunov exponents for the real system will be difficult. Such problems pave the way for more operational definitions of dynamic complexity (cf. Yao and Tong, this volume). Aside from its use in the characterization of chaos, nonlinear forecasting can be used more broadly in pragmatic classification problems. Here I review a recent example of nonlinear forecasting as it is applied to classify human heart rhythms. In particular, it is shown how forecast nonlinearity can be a good discriminator of the physiological effects of age, and how prediction-decay may discriminate heart-disease. In so doing, I introduce a method for characterizing nonlinearity using 'S-maps' and a method for analysing multiple short time series with composite attractors.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.1994.0106,"SUGIHARA, G",1994,Article,Philos.

289,SEQUENTIAL DATA ASSIMILATION WITH A NONLINEAR QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC MODEL USING MONTE-CARLO METHODS TO FORECAST ERROR STATISTICS,"A new sequential data assimilation method is discussed. It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.",https://doi.org/10.1029/94JC00572,"EVENSEN, G",1994,Article,J.

390,THE MODELING OF DAILY POACEAE POLLEN CONCENTRATIONS,"Records of pollen concentrations and meteorological data from five years of sampling in North London are used to develop models to predict daily Poaceae pollen counts. These models are developed using a variety of techniques including the use of a third-order polynomial curve to forecast potential pollen concentration and the use of accumulated meteorological variables. They are then tested for accuracy in forecasting the 1991 Poaceae pollen season. A model developed using accumulated average temperature, daily rainfall, relative humidity and maximum temperature as predictor variables attains an accuracy of 71% for the 1991 season. These models are designed specifically for their ease of use in practice and their reliance on meteorological variables that may be forecast in advance. They are also novel in attempting a forecast of daily pollen concentration based upon an estimate of the potential severity of the season instead of using a retrospective record of pollen abundance as previous authors have done.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00173139509429041,"NORRISHILL, J",1995,Article,Grana,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,modelling,NA
277,ONLINE ESTIMATION OF ERROR COVARIANCE PARAMETERS FOR ATMOSPHERIC DATA ASSIMILATION,"A simple scheme is presented for on-line estimation of covariance parameters in statistical data assimilation systems. The scheme is based on a maximum-likelihood approach in which estimates are produced on the basis of a single batch of simultaneous observations. Single-sample covariance estimation is reasonable as long as the number of available observations exceeds the number of tunable parameters by two or three orders of magnitude. Not much is known at present about model error associated with actual forecast systems. Our scheme can be used to estimate some important statistical model error parameters such as regionally averaged variances or characteristic correlation length scales. The advantage of the single-sample approach is that it does not rely on any assumptions about the temporal behavior of the covariance parameters: time-dependent parameter estimates can be continuously adjusted on the basis of current observations. This is of practical importance since it is likely to be the case that both model error and observation error strongly depend on the actual state of the atmosphere. The single-sample estimation scheme can be incorporated into any four-dimensional statistical data assimilation system that involves explicit calculation of forecast error covariances, including optimal interpolation (OI) and the simplified Kalman filter (SKF). The computational cost of the scheme is high but not prohibitive: online estimation of one or two covariance parameters in each analysis box of an operational boxed-OI system is currently feasible. A number of numerical experiments performed with an adaptive SKF and an adaptive version of OI, using a linear two-dimensional shallow-water model and artificially generated model error are described. The performance of the nonadaptive versions of these methods turns out to depend rather strongly on the correct specification of model error parameters. These parameters are estimated under a variety of conditions, including uniformly distributed model error and time-dependent model error statistics.",https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123<1128:OLEOEC>2.0.CO;2,"DEE, DP",1995,Article,Mon.

288,The use of artificial neural networks for the prediction of water quality parameters,"This paper presents the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a viable means of forecasting water quality parameters. A review of ANNs is given, and a case study is presented in which ANN methods are used to forecast salinity in the River Murray at Murray Bridge (South Australia) 14 days in advance. It is estimated that high salinity levels in the Murray cause $US 22 million damage per year to water users in Adelaide. Previous studies have shown that the average salinity of the water supplied to Adelaide could be reduced by about 10% if pumping from the Murray were to be scheduled in an optimal manner. This requires forecasts of salinity several weeks in advance. The results obtained were most promising. The average absolute percentage errors of the independent 14-day forecasts for four different years of data varied from 5.3% to 7.0%. The average absolute percentage error obtained as part of a real-time forecasting simulation for 1991 was 6.5%.",https://doi.org/10.1029/96WR03529,"Maier, HR; Dandy, GC",1996,Article,Water Resour.

353,"Modelling and forecasting annual fisheries catches: Comparison of regression, univariate and multivariate time series methods","In the present work, eight forecasting techniques are evaluated on the basis of their efficiency to model and provide accurate operational forecasts of the annual commercial landings of 16 species or groups of species in the Hellenic (Greek) marine waters. The development of operational forecasts was based on the following four general categories of forecasting techniques: (a) deterministic simple or multiple regression models incorporating different exogenous variables (time-varying regression, TV; multiple regression models incorporating time, fishing effort, wholesale value of catch and climatic variables, MREG); (b) univariate time series models (Brown's one parameter exponential smoothing, BES; Holt's two parameter exponential smoothing, HES; and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)); (c) multivariate time series techniques (harmonic regression, HREG; dynamic regression, DREG; and vector autoregressions. VAR); and (d) the 'biological' exponential surplus-yield model, FOX. Fits (for 1964-1987) and forecasts (for 1988-1989) obtained by the different models were compared with each other and with those of a naive method (NM) and an empirical one (i.e. combination of forecasts, EMP) using 32 different measures of accuracy. The results revealed that HREG and MREG models outperformed, in terms of fitting accuracy, the remaining eight models (NM, TV, BES, HES, FOX, ARIMA, VAR and EMP). They were both characterised by: ( a) higher accuracy in terms of all, or most, standard and relative statistical measures; (b) unbiased fits; (c) much better performance than NM; (d) transformed errors which were essentially white noise. In addition, HREG and MREG models: (e) explained from 79% to 97% of the variability of 13 transformed annual catches and from 31% to 61% for the remaining ones; (f) produced fits with MAPE values ranging from 3.4% to 21.2%; (g) in all, or most cases, predicted the between year variations during the fitting period, 1964-1987. In terms of forecasting performance, however, not a single best approach was found for the 16 annual catches. In general, BES and, to a lesser extent, HES, NM ( which actually is an ARIMA (0,1,0)), EMP and HREG models were among the best performers more often, produced the worst forecasts more rarely and were generally characterised by the higher number of stable forecasts and of forecasts with MAPE < 20% and < 10%. TV was also efficient for some annual series. Conversely, the poorest performers (FOX, MREG and ARIMA) rarely did better than average. The biological FOX models produced the least accurate and biased fits, bad forecasts (> 34.1%) in two out of four cases, and were characterised by transformed errors that were significantly (P < 0.05) autocorrelated. Some of the empirical models also had interesting explanations. Hence, the univariate ARIMA and multivariate VAR time series models predicted persistence of catches. The multivariate VAR and HREG time series models also predicted cycles in the variability of the catches with periods of 2-3 years. Moreover, FOX and MREG models indicated that fishing effort, wholesale value of catch and climate may, in a synergetic fashion, affect long-term trends and short-term variation in the catches of, at least, some species (or groups of species). Finally, MREG and VAR models predicted that variability and replacement of anchovy by sardine catches are not due to chance, and wind activity over the northern Aegean Sea may act as a forcing function.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(95)00389-4,"Stergiou, KI; Christou, ED",1996,Article,Fish Res.,English,rachel corrigan,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA

Jinheung at Icheon, South Korea, and on cvs. IR50 and C22 at Cavinti, Philippines, were generated, using weather factors identified by the WINDOW PANE program to be highly correlated with disease. Consecutive days with RH greater than or equal to 80% (CDRH80), number of days with RH greater than or equal to 80% (NDRH80), consecutive days with precipitation, and number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 84 mm day(-1) were important variables predicting blast at Icheon. Total precipitation, precipitation frequency, mean maximum and minimum temperatures, number of days with wind speed above 3 . 5 ms(-1), CDRH80, and NDRH80 were important predictors of blast at Cavinti. The Alien's predicted error sum of squares (PRESS) criterion and a cross-validation procedure were used to evaluate the models using data that were not included in model development. Validation test showed that all models developed for the two sites, except the models predicting maximum lesion number and panicle blast incidence at Icheon, and panicle blast severity on IR50 at Cavinti, predicted blast reasonably well based on low PRESS values and close to zero average prediction errors. These models can be applied in actual rice production systems, but future validation is needed to further improve their predictive ability.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3059.1996.d01-168.x,"Calvero, SB; Coakley, SM; Teng, PS",1996,Article,Plant Pathol.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
445,Modelling cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) in the River Murray using artificial neural networks,"In recent times, an apparent increase in the frequency and intensity of blooms of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) in the River Murray (Australia) has caused widespread concern. When present in large numbers, they can cause serious problems for domestic, industrial, agricultural and recreational users of water, as they can produce toxins and impart undesirable tastes and odours to water. It is important to understand the relationship between the incidence of algal populations and the prevailing environmental conditions in order to prevent algal blooms from occurring. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to model the incidence of a specific genus of cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp.) in the River Murray at Morgan, with the dual objectives of forecasting algal concentrations to give prior warning of impending blooms and to identify the factors that affect the blooms of Anabaena. The model inputs include weekly values of turbidity, colour, temperature, flow and the concentrations of total nitrogen, as well as soluble and total phosphorus. The results obtained are very promising as the model was able to forecast most major variations in Anabaena concentrations (timing and magnitude) for an eight-year period two weeks in advance. A sensitivity analysis carried out on the model inputs indicated that all input variables are important, with no one variable being dominant.",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4754(97)00022-0,"Maier, HR; Dandy, GC",1997,Article; Proceedings Paper,Math.

77,Factors affecting the timing of surface scums and epilimnetic blooms of blue-green algae in a eutrophic lake,"Blue-green algal blooms, which can occur mixed throughout the epilimnion or as scums at the lake surface, develop in response to a variety of factors. However, it is still unclear what conditions suggest that blooms are imminent or how far in advance blooms can be forecast. I assessed the predictability of surface scums and epilimnetic blooms from limnological, physical, and meteorological variables using data sampled daily during summer and fall 1993 in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. Daily chlorophyll a (a measure of blue-green algal biomass) was correlated to some weather, physical, and grazing variables at lags ranging from 0 to 9 days. Conditions immediately preceding surface scums were variable, making predictions difficult. However, during surface scums, Secchi disk depth, wind velocity, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation were significantly different than when the scums were absent. Based on predictors examined in this study, I developed criteria that identify the conditions sufficient for scums to form. In Lake Mendota, conditions sufficient for surface scum formation (proper weather and water column conditions and a pre-existing algal population) occur much more often than scums are observed. This study shows the importance of weather in determining both epilimnetic blue-green algal biomass and surface scum formation.",https://doi.org/10.1139/f97-104,"Soranno, PA",1997,Article,Can. J.

The development of operational forecasts was based on the following three general categories of forecasting techniques: (a) deterministic simple or multiple regression models incorporating different exogenous variables (seasonal time-varying regression, TVS; multiple regression models, MREG, incorporating time, number of fishers, wholesale value of catch and climatic variables); (b) univariate time series models (Winter's three parameter exponential smoothing, WES; ARIMA); and (c) multivariate time series techniques (harmonic regression, HREG; dynamic regression, DREG; vector autoregressions, VAR).

The results revealed that the univariate ARIMA, closely followed by the multivariate DREG time series model, outperformed the others (NM1, NM12, TVS, MREG, HREG, EMP, VAR and WES) in terms of both fitting and forecasting accuracy. They were characterised by: (a) higher accuracy in terms of all, or most of the standard and relative statistical measures that were usually tied together, (b) unbiased fits and forecasts; (c) much better performance than NM1 and NM12. In addition, ARIMA and DREG models: (d) explained over 80% of the variance of the transformed catches; (e) had residuals that were essentially white noise; (f) in all cases predicted the amplitude and the start and end of the fishing season; and (g) produced forecasts that had mean absolute percentage error values under 28.2% for 11 out of 16 monthly series. The different measures employed also indicated that EMP and WES models outperformed NMI, NM12, TVS, MREG and HREG models. EMP produced forecasts with MAPE values under 23.2% for ten monthly series, whereas WES produced forecasts with MAPE values under 25.3% for eight monthly series. This suggests their potential use in short-term fisheries forecasting. The limitations of the different forecasting techniques, measures of accuracy and data used in the present study are also discussed. Some of the empirical models built also had interesting biological/oceanographic explanations. Hence, the univariate ARIMA and multivariate DREG and VAR time series models all predicted persistence of catches. The univariate ARIMA and multivariate HREG, DREG and VAR time series models all predicted cycles in the variability of the catches with periods of 1 and 2-3 years. Moreover, MREG, DREG and VAR models indicated that the number of fishers, wholesale value of catch and climate may, in a synergistic fashion, affect long-term trends and short-term variation in the catches of at least some species (or groups of species). Finally, DREG and VAR models predicted that variability and replacement of anchovy by sardine catches are not due to chance and wind activity over the northern Aegean Sea may act as a forcing function.",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-7836(96)00482-1,"Stergiou, KI; Christou, ED; Petrakis, G",1997,Article,Fish Res.,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,1,NA,,,NA

While applications of deductive models still seem to be restricted by lack of knowledge, ad hoc inductive models sometimes prove to be straightforward and useful. The inductive neural network model ANNA is documented by means of an application to Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. ANNA was validated for five blue-green algae species where predictive accuracy has improved with increased event and time resolution of training data. A scenario analysis on species succession has demonstrated the potential of ANNA for hypothesis testing. Finally, implications for use of ANNA for operational algal bloom control are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1003041427672,"Recknagel, F",1997,Article; Proceedings Paper,Hydrobiologia,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
227,Nonlinear modelling and prediction with feedforward and recurrent networks,"In feedforward networks, signals flow in only one direction without feedback. Applications in forecasting, signal processing and control require explicit treatment of dynamics. Feedforward networks can accommodate dynamics by including past input and target values in an augmented set of inputs. A much richer dynamic representation results from also allowing for internal network feedbacks. These types of network models are called recurrent network models and are used by Jordan (1986) for controlling and learning smooth robot movements, and by Elman (1990) for learning and representing temporal structure in linguistics. In Jordan's network, past values of network output feed back into hidden units; in Elman's network, past values of hidden units feed back into themselves. The main focus of this study is to investigate the relative forecast performance of the Elman type recurrent network models in comparison to feedforward networks with deterministic and noisy data. The salient property of the Elman type recurrent network architecture is that the hidden unit activation functions (internal states) are fed back at every time step to provide an additional input. This recurrence gives the network dynamical properties which make it possible for the network to have internal memory. Exactly how this memory is represented in the internal states is not determined in advance. Instead, the network must discover the underlying temporal structure of the task and learn to encode that structure internally. The simulation results of this paper indicate that recurrent networks filter noise more successfully than feedforward networks in small as well as large samples.",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-2789(97)82009-X,"Gencay, R; Liu, T",1997,Article,Physica D,English,mary lofton,NA,1,0,1,NA,,,NA

The PNA (Pacific North American) atmospheric flow pattern, originally identified by Wallace and Gutzler (1981) is representative of a certain preferred configuration of the mid-tropospheric geopotential height field in the longitudinal sector extending from the mid-Pacific to the southeastern United States. The PNA index is defined as a linear combination of normalized geopotential height anomalies at the 700 mb level at four selected locations. Using multiple regression analysis, suitable linear combinations of predictors based on monthly values of ENSO and PNA indices are obtained which can foreshadow the summer season's weather over the crop-growing region of the Canadian prairie provinces with a lead time of 2 to 7 months. The utility of the ENSO and PNA indices for advance indication of summer weather with implications for grain yields over the Canadian prairies is further discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s007040050032,"Garnett, ER; Khandekar, ML; Babb, JC",1998,Article,Theor.

However, as a result of the relative newness of the technique to this field, users appear to have limited knowledge about how ANNs operate and how to optimise their performance. In this paper, the stages observed when training a back-propagation neural network: are examined in detail for a particular case study; the forecasting of salinity in the River Murray at Murray Bridge, South Australia, 14 days in advance. Particular attention is paid to the behaviour of the network as it approaches a local minimum in the error surface. The effect of the presence of infrequent patterns in the training set on generalisation ability is investigated. The nature of the error surface in the vicinity of local minima is examined and options for optimising network performance (i.e. training speed and generalisation ability) are presented for real time forecasting situations.

The direct use of the cloud-cleared radiances became the operational technique for using satellite sounding data at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in October 1995. The methodology for using the data (including bias correction, ozone analysis, skin temperature analysis, and quality control) are described in this paper. The impact of the direct use of the radiances compared to the previously operational use of satellite sounding data shows considerable improvement in NCEP's forecast skill, especially in the Southern Hemisphere.

Calculations mag be performed sequentially on multiple meteorological grids, going from fine to coarse resolution and using either archive or forecast data fields. Air concentration calculations associate the mass of the pollutant species with the release of either puffs, particles, or a combination of both. The dispersion rate is calculated from the vertical diffusivity profile, wind shear, and horizontal deformation of the mind field. Air concentrations are calculated at a specific grid-point for puffs and as cell-average concentrations for particles. The model results are evaluated against ACE balloon trajectories, air concentrations from the ANATEX tracer experiment, radiological deposition from the Chernobyl accident, and satellite photographs of the Rabaul volcanic eruption. One common feature of the model results was their sensitivity to the vertical atmospheric structure; trajectories in terms of their height when near ground-level due to the strong gradients of wind speed and direction, air concentrations with respect to the rate of vertical mixing, and deposition as a result of the vertical distribution of the pollutant.",NA,"Draxier, RR; Hess, GD",1998,Article,Aust.

287,A stochastic modelling approach for real-time forecasting of winter wheat yield,"Crop simulation models are receiving increasing use in agriculture and are recommended as multipurpose tools in research and farm management. Of one particular interest to crop growers is the possibility of applying crop models for real-time yield forecasting. This investigation evaluated the utility of the SUCROS model for site-specific real-time crop biomass and grain yield forecasting. A stochastic forecasting approach was used combining generated weather data with observed data for model updating. The forecast procedure was tested with field data collected at four sites in the UK over two growing seasons. The results showed that across all site-years, the model is able to forecast the final biomass and grain yield with <10% bias. There was no significant difference between observed and forecasted biomass and grain yield for forecasts made at anthesis or milky grain stage although earlier forecasts did show significant differences. The ranking of the observed and forecast biomass and grain yield were also highly correlated for the later forecasts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

41,The ESA Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer MERIS - a review of the instrument and its mission,"Following the successful operations of the ERS-1 and 2 satellites which are mainly dedicated to physical oceanography and ice observations from space, the European Space Agency (ESA) developed a multidisciplinary Earth observation instrument within its polar Earth Observation Programme with a focus on biological ocean observations. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) will be launched onboard Envisat-1 in the 1999-2000 time frame, providing a European remote sensing capability for observing for example oceanic biology and marine water quality through observations of water colour: MERIS will have a medium spectral and high radiometric resolution and a dual spatial resolution, within a global mission, covering open ocean and coastal zone waters, important aspects of the atmosphere, and large ecosystems over land. The global mission of MERIS will have a major contribution to scientific projects aimed at greater understanding of the role of oceans and ocean productivity in the climate system and our ability to forecast change through models. Secondary objectives of the MERIS mission will be directed to the measurement of atmospheric parameters associated with clouds, water vapour and aerosols in addition to land surface parameters, important in particular for the understanding of vegetation processes. In advance of the launch of MERIS, algorithms are being developed for the interpretation of MERIS observations and dedicated studies are ongoing to establish the means of validating the data products. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the MERIS concept, its mission and data products in context of the driving scientific requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1080/014311699212416,"Rast, M; Bezy, JL; Bruzzi, S",1999,Article,Int.

2,Construction of correlation functions in two and three dimensions,"This article focuses on the construction, directly in physical space, of simply parametrized covariance functions for data-assimilation applications. A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. The Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R-3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S-2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S-2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S-2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms. Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R-3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that g(i) and g(j) are radially symmetric functions defined on R-3 such that g(i) (x) = 0 for vertical bar x vertical bar > d(i) and g(j)(x) = 0 for vertical bar x vertical bar > d(j), 0 < d(i),d(j) <= where vertical bar.vertical bar denotes Euclidean distance in R-3. The parameters d(i) and d(j) are 'cut-off' distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions less than or equal to infinity, C-ij (x, y) := (g(i) *g(j))(x - y), i not equal j, and convolution covariance functions C-ii (x, y) := (g(i) * g(i))(x - y), vanishing for vertical bar x - y vertical bar > d(i) + d(j) and vertical bar x - y vertical bar > 2d(i), respectively. Additional covariance functions on R-3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R-3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form C(x, y) := C-0(vertical bar x - y vertical bar), x, y is an element of R-3, where the functions C-0(r) for r is an element of R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y is an element of S-2 approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S-2 x S-2.",https://doi.org/10.1256/smsqj.55416,"Gaspari, G; Cohn, SE",1999,Article,Q.

303,Analysis of fragmented time series data using Box-Jenkins models,"Throughout ecology, fragmented time series data have remained largely unanalyzed even though numerous methods exist for both structural and Box-Jenkins time series models. We evaluated four fragmented-data techniques for Box-Jenkins models using a data set of Peromyscus leucopus densities that spans 248 months and contains 15% missing data. We (1) approximated missing data using a linear interpolation between available observations (interpolation model), (2) estimated missing data according to the autocorrelation pattern identified with available data (estimation model), (3) forecasted missing data and reestimated the model until the forecasts converged using an estimation maximization algorithm (maximization model), and (4) omitted missing data during parameter estimation (omission model). We compared overall model fit using the Schwarz information criterion and outlier analysis. We found that the estimation and omission models fit the data better than the maximization model and far better than the interpolation model. In addition, the estimation model created more biologically realistic estimates of missing data than either the interpolation or maximization model. These results are directly applicable to multivariate Box-Jenkins time series models.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03610919908813571,"Lewellen, RH; Vessey, SH",1999,Article,Commun. Stat.-Simul.

263,Statistical design for adaptive weather observations,"Suppose that one has the freedom to adapt the observational network by choosing the times and locations of observations. Which choices would yield the best analysis of the atmospheric state or the best subsequent forecast? Here, this problem of ""adaptive observations"" is formulated as a problem in statistical design. The statistical framework provides a rigorous mathematical statement of the adaptive observations problem and indicates where the uncertainty of the current analysis, the dynamics of error evolution, the form and errors of observations, and data assimilation each enter the calculation. The statistical formulation of the problem also makes clear the importance of the optimality criteria (for instance, one might choose to minimize the total error variance in a given forecast) and identifies approximations that make calculation of optimal solutions feasible in principle. Optimal solutions are discussed and interpreted for a. variety of cases. Selected approaches to the adaptive observations problem found in the literature are reviewed and interpreted from the optimal statistical design viewpoint. In addition, a numerical example, using the 40-variable model of Lorenz and Emanuel, suggests that some other proposed approaches may often be close to the optimal solution, at least in this highly idealized model.",https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1999)056<2536:SDFAWO>2.0.CO;2,"Berliner, LM; Lu, ZQ; Snyder, C",1999,Article,J.

The west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) stock is selected as an example application based on data compiled from long-term ecosystem research and stock assessment programs. A fuzzy logic decision procedure was used to evaluate all possible neural networks. The output from the two ""optimal"" networks was compared with the output from a multiple regression analysis and a standard Ricker climate stock-recruitment model. The performance of the neural network models in reproducing a 41-year time series was far superior (R(2) between the fitted and observed recruitment is about 60-70%) to the multiple linear regression model (R(2) = 0.29) and the Ricker climate stock-recruitment model (R(2) = 42%). This pilot study demonstrates how artificial neural networks can be used to improve the accuracy of fishery stock forecasts and hence the management of the fishery resources by making the actual harvest rate (catch/stock biomass) closer to the target harvest rate (desired catch/stock biomass).",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-12-2385,"Chen, DG; Ware, DM",1999,Article,Can.

274,The use of neural networks in the control of water quality,"In the treatment of raw water, to make it suitable for use as drinking-water, it is necessary to monitor and control colour as a key parameter of concern to the customer[1]. The ability to predict raw-water colour is a desirable feature in the optimisation of the treatment process. In order to remove this discoloration, a coagulant is added. The required dosage is affected by a combination of the six parameters: raw water colour, raw water pH, raw water turbidity, raw water conductivity, dosed water pH and raw water temperature. These six variables are continuously monitored, and may be used to predict the necessary setting for the coagulant flow valve. Raw-water colour is inherently non-linear as a time series relationship, arid it is difficult to achieve accurate modeling with conventional time series modeling techniques. This paper considers a number of possible methods including multiple regression, subtractive fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks (ANNs). From this prediction it is possible to calculate the required dose of coagulant to eliminate the discoloration. Results show that the ANN modeling scheme is as good as the other methods in forecasting the raw-water colour in river water, and lends itself to the design of an ANN controller for dispensing the appropriate dose of coagulant[2].",NA,"Waterworth, G",2000,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,1
299,Forecasting cyanobacterial concentrations using B-spline networks,"Artificial neural networks have been used successfully in a number of areas of civil engineering, including hydrology and water resources engineering. In the vast majority of cases, multilayer perceptrons that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm are used. One of the major shortcomings of this approach is that it is difficult to elicit the knowledge about the input/output mapping that is stored in the trained networks. One way to overcome this problem is to use B-spline associative memory networks (AMNs), because their connection weights may be interpreted as a set of fuzzy membership functions and hence the relationship between the model inputs and outputs may be written as a set of fuzzy rules. In this paper, multilayer perceptrons and AMN models are compared, and their main advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The performance of both model types is compared in terms of prediction accuracy and model transparency for a particular water quality case study, the forecasting (4 weeks in advance) of concentrations of the cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia. The forecasts obtained using both model types are good. Neither model clearly outperforms the other, although the forecasts obtained when the B-spline AMN model is used may be considered slightly better overall. In addition, the B-spline AMN model provides more explicit information about the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. The fuzzy rules extracted from the B-spline AMN model indicate that incidences of Anabaena spp, are likely to occur after the passing of a flood hydrograph and when water temperatures are high.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2000)14:3(183),"Maier, HR; Sayed, T; Lence, BJ",2000,Article,J.

259,Time series modelling of landings in Northwest Mediterranean Sea,"Univariate seasonal ARIMA and intervention models were developed to forecast monthly catches of 53 commercial species in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, up to one year in advance. In general terms, there was good agreement between forecasts and observed catches of target demersal species. By contrast, models fitted to non-target demersal species and pelagic species were unsatisfactory in terms of explained variability and predicting power. Large commercial size classes were better explained than the small size classes. Intervention analysis was used to identify the significance, magnitude and form of structural shifts (interventions) of the time series for each species. Most of the fitted interventions appeared in small commercial size classes and indicated a decrease in the mean level of the catch. Seasonality of demersal species, caught mainly by trawlers, was mainly attributed to changing availability and recruitment. By contrast, gear type explained the seasonal variation in landings of pelagic and some coastal species. Catch declines of two species were also compared with the variations of their respective seasonal patterns.

120,Nowcasting of urban air pollutants by neural networks,"The modelling of urban air quality prediction is a difficult task because: i) the processes are controlled by complex chemical and physical mechanisms; ii) its state is ascertained by measuring too few parameters for a sufficient chemical picture; iii) sampling measurements are generally collected at too few points without consideration of scaling (for example CO is a local phenomenon while O-3 is regional and both are often measured by the same monitoring network); iv) balances of chemical species are often forced to work far from ""local equilibria"". In order to overcome these problems, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used here because they are model free and require very little knowledge about the underlying system structure. CO, NO2, and O-3 concentrations at the time (t + Deltat) are variables that depend on their previous concentrations and of other external information, such as meteorological data, solar radiation, chemical precursors or vehicle traffic information. ANNs used in this work were able to explain over 90% of the variability of the pollutant concentrations considered at the next hour (CO, NO2, and O-3) and over 80% of that of the next three-hour O-3 concentration. The forecasting of CO peaks exceeding a given value has been successfully performed by transforming original concentration time series into a probability series and processing the transformed data by an ANN.

395,Long-lead prediction of Pacific SSTs via Bayesian dynamic modeling,"Tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the accompanying El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon are recognized as significant components of climate behavior. The atmospheric and oceanic processes involved display highly complicated variability over both space and time. Researchers have applied both physically derived modeling and statistical approaches to develop long-lead predictions of tropical Pacific SSTs. The comparative successes of these two approaches are a subject of substantial inquiry and some controversy. Presented in this article is a new procedure for long-lead forecasting of tropical Pacific SST fields that expresses qualitative aspects of scientific paradigms for SST dynamics in a statistical manner. Through this combining of substantial physical understanding and statistical modeling and learning, this procedure acquires considerable predictive skill. Specifically, a Markov model, applied to a low-order (empirical orthogonal function-based) dynamical system of tropical Pacific SST, with stochastic regime transition, is considered. The approach accounts explicitly for uncertainty in the formulation of the model, which leads to realistic error bounds on forecasts. The methodology that makes this possible is hierarchical Bayesian dynamical modeling.",https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2001)013<3953:LLPOPS>2.0.CO;2,"Berliner, LM; Wikle, CK; Cressie, N",2000,Article,J.

29,Scaling-up crop models for climate variability applications,"Although most dynamic crop models have been developed and tested for the scale of a homogeneous plot, applications related to climate variability are often at broader spatial scales that can incorporate considerable heterogeneity. This study reviews issues and approaches related to applying crop models at scales larger than the plot, Perfect aggregate prediction at larger scales requires perfect integration of a perfect model across the range of variability of perfect input data. Aggregation error results from imperfect integration of heterogeneous inputs, and includes distortions of either spatial mean values of predictions or year-to-year variability of the spatial means. Approaches for reducing aggregation error include sampling input variability in geographic or probability space, and calibration of model inputs or outputs. Implications of scale and spatial interactions for model structure and complexity are a matter of ongoing debate. Large-scale crop model applications must address limitations of soil, weather and management data. Distortion of weather sequences from spatial averaging is a particular danger.

104,Comparison of short-term rainfall prediction models for real-time flood forecasting,"This study compares the accuracy of the: short-term rainfall forecasts obtained with time-series analysis techniques, using past rainfall depths as the only input information. The techniques proposed here are linear stochastic auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) models, artificial neural networks (ANN) and the non-parametric nearest-neighbours method. The rainfall forecasts obtained using the considered methods are then routed through a lumped, conceptual, rainfall-runoff model, thus implementing a coupled rainfall-runoff forecasting procedure for a case study on the Apennines mountains, Italy. The study analyses and compares the relative advantages and limitations of each time-series analysis technique, used for issuing rainfall forecasts for lead-times varying from 1 to 6 h. The results also indicate how the considered time-series analysis techniques, and especially those based on the use of ANN. provide a significant improvement in the flood forecasting accuracy in comparison to the use of simple rainfall prediction approaches of heuristic type. which are often applied in hydrological practice.

322,A non-linear combination of the forecasts of rainfall-runoff models by the first-order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system,"With a plethora of watershed rainfall-runoff models available for flood forecasting and more than adequate computing power to operate a number of such models simultaneously, we can now combine the simulation results from the different models to produce the combination forecasts. In this paper, the first-order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system is introduced and explained as the fourth combination method (besides other three combination methods tested earlier, i.e, the simple average method (SAM), the weighted average method (WAM), and the neural network method (NNM)) to combine together the simulation results of five different conceptual rainfall-runoff models in a Bead forecasting study on eleven catchments. The comparison of the forecast simulation efficiency of the first-order Takagi-Sugeno combination method with the other three combination methods demonstrates that the first-order Takagi-Sugeno method is just as efficient as both the WAM and the NNM in enhancing the flood forecasting accuracy. Considering its simplicity and efficiency, the first-order Takagi-Sugeno method is recommended for use as the combination system for flood forecasting. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

34,Predictive ecological modeling of harmful algal blooms,"We have thus far constructed a series of coupled ecological/physical models to predict the origin and fate of harmful algal blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium breve, on the West Florida shelf We find that (1) the maximal population growth rate of G. breve must be similar to0.80 day(-1) during initiation of a red tide, but as little as 0.08 day(-1) during its decay, (2) diatoms dominate when estuarine and shelf-break supplies of nitrate are made available to a model community of small and large diatoms, coccoid cyanophytes and Trichodesmium, non-toxic and red-tide dinoflagellates, microflagellates, and coccolithophores, (3) a numerical recipe for large red tides of G. breve requires DON supplies, mediated by iron-starved, nitrogen-fixers, while small blooms may persist on sediment sources of DON, (4) selective grazing must be exerted on the non-toxic dinoflagellates, and (5) vertical migration of G. breve in relation to seasonal changes of summer downwelling and fall/winter upwelling flow fields determines the duration and intensity of red tide landfalls along the barrier islands and beaches of the west coast of Florida, once other losses are specified. Given poorly known initial and boundary conditions and the expense of shipboard monitoring programs, however, bio-optical moorings or remote sensors are the most likely sources of model validation and improved HAB forecasts. Accordingly, the bio-optical implications of our ecological models must be included in future simulation analyses of HABs on both the West Florida shelf and within other coastal regions. Of particular importance for initiation of the coupled biophysical models is an improved understanding of the relationship of remotely sensed surface signals to shade-adapted dinoflagellates, aggregating below the first optical depth of the water column.",https://doi.org/10.1080/20018091095069,"Walsh, JJ; Penta, B; Dieterle, DA; Bissett, WP",2001,Article; Proceedings Paper,Hum.

301,"Equifinality, data assimilation, and uncertainty estimation in mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems using the GLUE methodology","It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

380,Hydrological modelling using artificial neural networks,"This review considers the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to rainfall-runoff modelling and flood forecasting. This is an emerging field of research, characterized by a wide variety of techniques, a diversity of geographical contexts, a general absence of intermodel comparisons, and inconsistent reporting of model skill. This article begins by outlining the basic principles of ANN modelling, common network architectures and training algorithms. The discussion then addresses related themes of the division and preprocessing of data for model calibration/validation; data standardization techniques; and methods of evaluating ANN model performance. A literature survey underlines the need for clear guidance in current modelling practice, as well as the comparison of ANN methods with more conventional statistical models. Accordingly, a template is proposed in order to assist the construction of future ANN rainfall-runoff models. Finally, it is suggested that research might focus on the extraction of hydrological 'rules' from ANN weights, and on the development of standard performance measures that penalize unnecessary model complexity.",https://doi.org/10.1191/030913301674775671,"Dawson, CW; Wilby, RL",2001,Article,Prog.

94,Neural network based modelling of environmental variables: A systematic approach,"Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm are a useful tool for modelling environmental systems. They have already been successfully used to model salinity, nutrient concentrations, air pollution, and algal growth. These successes, coupled with their suitability for modelling complex systems, have resulted in an increase in their popularity and their application in an ever increasing number of areas. They are generally treated as black box models that are able to capture underlying relationships when presented with input and output data. In many instances, little consideration is given to potential input data and the internal workings of ANNs. This can result in inferior model performance and an inability to accurately compare the performance of different ANN models. Back-propagation networks employ a modelling philosophy that is similar to that of statistical methods in the sense that unknown model parameters (i.e., connection weights) are adjusted in order to obtain the best match between a historical set of model inputs and corresponding outputs. Consequently, the principles that are considered good practice in the development of statistical models should be considered. In this paper, a systematic approach to the development of ANN based forecasting models is presented, which is intended to act as a guide for potential and current users of feedforward ANNs that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm. Issues that need to be considered in the model development phase are discussed and ways of addressing them presented. The major areas covered include data transformation, the determination of appropriate model inputs, the determination of an appropriate network geometry, the optimisation of connection weights, and validation of model performance.

370,Estimating uncertainty in fish stock assessment and forecasting,"A variety of tools are available to quantify uncertainty in age-structured fish stock assessments and in management forecasts. These tools are based on particular choices for the underlying population dynamics model, the aspects of the assessment considered uncertain, and the approach for assessing uncertainty (Bayes, frequentist or likelihood). The current state of the art is advancing rapidly as a consequence of the availability of increased computational power, but there remains little consistency in the choices made for assessments and forecasts. This can be explained by several factors including the specifics of the species under consideration, the purpose for which the analysis is conducted and the institutional framework within which the methods are developed and used, including the availability and customary usage of software tools. Little testing of either the methods or their assumptions has yet been done. Thus, it is not possible to argue either that the methods perform well or perform poorly or that any particular conditioning choices are more appropriate in general terms than others. Despite much recent progress, fisheries science has yet to identify a means for identifying appropriate conditioning choices such that the probability distributions which are calculated for management purposes do adequately represent the probabilities of eventual real outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that increased focus should be placed on testing and carefully examining the choices made when conducting these analyses, and that more attention must be given to examining the sensitivity to alternative assumptions and model structures. Provision of advice concerning uncertainty in stock assessments should include consideration of such sensitivities, and should use model-averaging methods, decision tables or management procedure simulations in cases where advice is strongly sensitive to model assumptions.",https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-2960.2001.00042.x,"Patterson, K; Cook, R; Darby, C; Gavaris, S; Kell, L; Lewy, P; Mesnil, B; Punt, A; Restrepo, V; Skagen, DW; Stefansson, G",2001,Article,Fish.

181,Hydrologic data assimilation with the ensemble Kalman filter,"Soil moisture controls the partitioning of moisture and energy fluxes at the land surface and is a key variable in weather and climate prediction. The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the filter's performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update time are reduced by 55% (or 70%; or 80%) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84% for the optimal smoother). For robust error variance estimates, an ensemble of at least 500 members is needed. The dynamic evolution of the estimation error variances is dominated by wetting and drying events with high variances during drydown and low variances when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Furthermore, the ensemble distribution of soil moisture is typically symmetric except under very dry or wet conditions when the effects of the nonlinearities in the model become significant. As a result, the actual errors are consistently larger than ensemble-derived forecast and analysis error variances. This suggests that the update is suboptimal. However, the degree of suboptimality is relatively small and results presented here indicate that the EnKF is a flexible and robust data assimilation option that gives satisfactory estimates even for moderate ensemble sizes.",https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2002)130<0103:HDAWTE>2.0.CO;2,"Reichle, RH; McLaughlin, DB; Entekhabi, D",2002,Article,Mon.

157,Using a dynamic hydrology model to predict mosquito abundances in flood and swamp water,"We modeled surface wetness at high resolution, using a dynamic hydrology model, to predict flood and swamp water mosquito abundances. Historical meteorologic data, as well as topographic, soil, and vegetation data, were used to model surface wetness and identify potential fresh and swamp water breeding habitats in two northern New Jersey watersheds. Surface wetness was positively associated with the subsequent abundance of the dominant floodwater mosquito species, Aedes vexans, and the swamp water species, Anopheles walked. The subsequent abundance of Culex pipiens, a species that breeds in polluted, eutrophic waters, was negatively correlated with local modeled surface wetness. These associations permit real-time monitoring and forecasting of these floodwater and nonfloodwater species at high spatial and temporal resolution. These predictions will enable public health agencies to institute control measures before the mosquitoes emerge as adults, when their role as transmitters of disease comes into play.",NA,"Shaman, J; Stieglitz, M; Stark, C; Le Blancq, S; Cane, M",2002,Article,Emerg.

65,Insects and low temperatures: from molecular biology to distributions and abundance,"Insects are the most diverse fauna on earth, with different species occupying a range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats from the tropics to the poles. Species inhabiting extreme low-temperature environments must either tolerate or avoid freezing to survive. While much is now known about the synthesis, biochemistry and function of the main groups of cryoprotectants involved in the seasonal processes of acclimatization and winter cold hardiness (ice-nucleating agents, polyols and antifreeze proteins), studies on the structural biology of these compounds have been more limited. The recent discovery of rapid cold-hardening, ice-interface desiccation and the daily resetting of critical thermal thresholds affecting mortality and mobility have emphasized the role of temperature as the most important abiotic factor, acting through physiological processes to determine ecological outcomes. These relationships are seen in key areas such as species responses to climate warming, forecasting systems for pest outbreaks and the establishment potential of alien species in new environments.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2002.1074,"Bale, JS",2002,Article; Proceedings Paper,Philos.

The forecasting performance was compared among four models, i.e., the SARIMABP and SARIMA models and the two neural network models with differenced and deseasonalized data, respectively. Among these methods, the mean square error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the SARIMABP model were the lowest. The SARIMABP model was also able to forecast certain significant turning points of the test time series. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

128,Some aspects of the improvement in skill of numerical weather prediction,"Recent verification statistics show a considerable improvement in the accuracy of forecasts from three global numerical weather prediction systems. The improvement amounts to about a 1-day gain in predictability of mean-sea-level pressure and 500 hPa height over the last decade in the northern hemisphere, with a similar gain over the last 3 years in the southern hemisphere. Differences between the initial analyses from the three systems have been substantially reduced. Detailed study of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts verifications shows that identifiable improvements in the data assimilation, model and observing systems have significantly increased the accuracy of both short- and medium-range forecasts, although interannual (flow-dependent) variations in error-growth characteristics complicate the picture. The implied r.m.s. error of 500 hPa height analyses has fallen well below the 10 in level typical of radiosonde measurement error. Intrinsic error-doubling times, computed from the divergence of northern hemisphere forecasts started I day apart, exhibit a small overall reduction over the past 10 years at day two and beyond, and a much larger reduction at day one. Error-doubling times for the southern hemisphere have become generally shorter and are now similar to those for the northern hemisphere. One-day forecast errors have been reduced so much in the southern hemisphere that medium-range forecasts for the region have become almost as skilful as those for the northern hemisphere. The approach to saturation of forecast error beyond the 10-day range has been examined for sets of 21-day forecasts. When the systematic (sample-mean) component of the error is subtracted, forecast errors and the differences between successive forecasts both appear to level out near the end of the 2 1-day range at values close to the limit set by the natural level of variance of the atmosphere for the northern hemisphere. A number of features of the model 500 hPa height fields remain quite realistic at the three-week range. The most obvious discrepancy in mean climate is in the Pacific/North-American sector, and variance is too high in the southern hemisphere.",https://doi.org/10.1256/003590002321042135,"Simmons, AJ; Hollingsworth, A",2002,Article,Q.

69,Ability for a model to predict crop production variability at the regional scale: an evaluation for sugar beet,"The spatial application of crop models for the prediction of plot yields on a regional scale has specific constraints. Firstly, it supposes accurate input into the model from sources concerning the spatial variability of crop performance. Furthermore, it is necessary for the model to be suitable for simulating interactions between the environment, agricultural practices and the crop which explain this variability. The aim of this article is to evaluate a sugar beet growth model, SUCROS, in terms of its ability to predict the spatial variability of yields on the scale of a beet-producing region. The model was adjusted to the agronomic context of northern France by taking into account the effects of moisture stress on leaf senescence and on the partitioning of assimilates. This modification reduced by more than a half the error of LAI and storage organ dry weight estimates. The modified model was then tested on thirty four plots of two beet production region, and we were able to demonstrate that its performance was closely linked to the accuracy of input variables concerning the climate and soil water properties of each plot.",https://doi.org/10.1051/agro:2002078,"Launay, M; Guerif, M",2003,Article,Agronomie,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,drivers are not forecasted,NA
199,Monitoring Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico using satellite ocean color imagery and other data,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of Karenia brevis are a recurrent problem in the Gulf of Mexico, with nearly annual occurrences on the Florida southwest coast, and fewer occurrences on the northwest Florida and Texas coasts. Beginning in 1999, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued the Gulf of Mexico HAB Bulletins to support state monitoring and management efforts. These bulletins involve analysis of satellite imagery with field and meteorological station data. The effort involves several components or models: (a) monitoring the movement of an algal bloom that has previously been identified as a HAB (type 1 forecast); (b) detecting new blooms as HAB or non-HAB (type 2); (c) predicting the movement of an identified HAB (type 3); (d) predicting conditions favorable for a HAB to occur where blooms have not yet been observed (type 4). The types 1 and 2 involve methods of bloom detection requiring routine remote sensing, especially satellite ocean color imagery and in situ data. Prediction (types 3 and 4) builds on the monitoring capability by using interpretative and numerical modeling. Successful forecasts cover more than 1000 km of coast and require routine input of remotely sensed and in situ data. The data sources used in this effort include ocean colorimagery from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor/OrbView-2 satellite and processed using coastal-specific algorithms, wind data from coastal and offshore buoys, field observations of bloom location and intensity provided by state agencies, and forecasts from the National Weather Service. The HAB Bulletins began in coordination with the state of Florida in autumn of 1999 and included K. brevis bloom monitoring (type 1), with limited advisories on transport (type 3) and the detection of blooms in new areas (type 2). In autumn 2000, we improved both the transport forecasts and detection capabilities and began prediction of conditions favorable for bloom development (type 4). The HAB Bulletins have had several successes. The state of Florida was advised of the potential for a bloom to occur at the end of September 2000 (type 4), and the state was alerted to the position of blooms in January 2000 and October 2001 in areas that had not been previously sampled (type 3). These successful communications of HAB activity allowed Florida agencies responsible for shellfish management and public health to respond to a rapidly developing event in a timely, efficient manner.

129,Forecasting of reference evapotranspiration by artificial neural networks,"In recent years, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied to forecasting in many areas of engineering. In this note, a sequentially adaptive radial basis function network is applied to the forecasting of reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The sequential adaptation of parameters and structure is achieved using an extended Kalman filter. The criterion for network growing is obtained from the Kalman filter's consistency test, while the criteria for neuron/connection pruning are based on the statistical parameter significance test. The weather parameter data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine) were available at Nis, Serbia and Montenegro, from January 1977 to December 1996. The monthly reference evapotranspiration data were obtained by the Penman-Monteith method, which is proposed as the sole standard method for the computation of reference evapotranspiration. The network learned to forecast ETo,t-1 based on ETo,t-11 and ETo,t-23. The results show that ANNs can be used for forecasting reference evapotranspiration with high reliability.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2003)129:6(454),"Trajkovic, S; Todorovic, B; Stankovic, M",2003,Article,J.

453,Empirical modelling of interannual trends in abundance of squid (Loligo forbesi) in Scottish waters,"This study compares alternative empirical models for forecasting interannual variation in squid (Loligo spp.) abundance around Scotland (UK). Annual abundance indices (1970-1996) were derived from fishery data, for stocks in coastal waters (northern North Sea and West Coast) and the Rockall area. Abundance in coastal waters was correlated. with several annual environmental indices, including the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index and the average sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) in the northern North Sea. Regression models, relating fishery abundance to annual environmental indices, and time-series models, predicting abundance from the previous year's abundance, could both provide reasonable fits to observed abundance data. Model fits obtained for coastal waters were generally better than those for the Rockall area. Regression models produced consistently poor forecasts whereas time-series models produced satisfactory forecasts for the years 1997-1999. Forecast accuracy for the time-series models could be improved by taking into account environmental variables. Thus, adding effects of SST in May in the northern North Sea in the current and previous years improved a time-series model of squid abundance in coastal waters. Improved forecasts were also achieved by fitting time-series models to monthly abundance data. The apparent influence of May SST in the northern North Sea on the coastal fishery could indicate that SST affects recruitment strength. Results for the offshore Rockall fishery suggest that large-scale and longer-term oceanographic processes may be involved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

98,Time series forecasting using a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model,"Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is one of the popular linear models in time series forecasting during the past three decades. Recent research activities in forecasting with artificial neural networks (ANNs) suggest that ANNs can be a promising alternative to the traditional linear methods. ARIMA models and ANNs are often compared with mixed conclusions in terms of the superiority in forecasting performance. In this paper, a hybrid methodology that combines both ARIMA and ANN models is proposed to take advantage of the unique strength of ARIMA and ANN models in linear and nonlinear modeling. Experimental results with real data sets indicate that the combined model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by either of the models used separately.

36,Forecasting aphid outbreaks and epidemics of Cucumber mosaic virus in lupin crops in a Mediterranean-type environment,"Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) causes a serious disease of narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius). It is seed-borne in lupin and seed-infected plants act as the primary virus source for secondary spread by aphid vectors within crops. Infection with CMV causes yield losses of up to 60% in epidemic years, but has little impact on yield in years when spread is limited. Aphids also cause sporadic yield losses due to direct feeding damage. A simulation model was developed to forecast aphid outbreaks and epidemics of CMV in lupin crops growing in the 'grainbelt' of south-west Australia, which has a Mediterranean-type climate. The model uses rainfall during summer and early autumn to calculate an index of aphid build-up on weeds, crop volunteers and self-regenerating annual pastures in each 'grainbelt' locality before the growing season commences in late autumn. The index is used to forecast the timing of aphid immigration into crops. The subsequent aphid build-up and movement within the crop, spread of CMV from virus-infected source plants within the crop, yield losses and percentage of harvested seed-infected are then calculated. The model evaluates the effects of different sowing dates, percentages of CMV infection in seed sown and plant population densities on virus spread. The model simulations were validated with 14 years' field data from six different sites in the 'grainbelt', representing a wide range of pre-growing season rainfall scenarios, sowing dates, percentages of infection in seed sown and plant population densities. The model was incorporated into a decision support system (DSS) for use by lupin farmers and agricultural consultants in planning CMV management and targeting sprays against aphids to prevent direct feeding damage. The inputs required from the user are lupin cultivar, anticipated emergence date, percentage CMV infection in seed sown, plant density and location. The output consists of a personalised risk forecast for the user and includes predictions for date of first aphid arrival, aphid numbers, CMV spread, final virus incidence, yield loss due to infection and percentage infection in harvested seed. Predictions from the DSS are accessible via an Internet site and from other information sources. The model can serve as a template for modelling similar virus/aphid vector pathosystems in other regions of the world, especially those with Mediterranean-type climates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

264,Decision making in controlling virus yellows of sugar beet in the UK,"Virus yellows is an important disease affecting yield in sugar beet in the UK. Myzus persicae (Sulzer) is the most effective and efficient aphid vector of the three viruses causing the disease: beet yellows virus, beet mild yellowing virus and beet chlorosis virus. Control of virus yellows disease is thus focused on the study and control of this aphid species. UK national surveys of virus yellows began in 1946 and these data helped to formulate disease forecasting schemes to optimise control. Over the years, in addition to improvements in farm hygiene, periodic changes and developments in control of the disease have occurred. To accommodate these important developments, virus yellows forecasting schemes have evolved accordingly. The most recent version has been adapted to take account of the current widespread use of imidacloprid seed treatment.

324,Will Lake Michigan lake trout meet the Great Lakes strategy 2002 PCB reduction goal?,"The Great Lakes Strategy 2002 establishes the long-term goal that all Great Lakes fish should be safe to eat without restriction. As an indicator of progress toward that goal, the Strategy specifies that lake trout PCBs will decline 25% from 2000 to 2007. We estimated the plausibility of achieving this near-term goal by examining a time-series of Lake Michigan lake trout PCB concentrations from 1972 to 2000. We used two different Bayesian approaches, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and dynamic linear models (DLM), to model the trajectory of these historical data and forecast concentrations through 2007. Both approaches indicate that the probability of a 25% reduction from 2000 to 2007 is negligible. The most likely lake trout PCB declines predicted by the BMA and DLM over this time period are 6.8% and 8.9%, respectively. Our results suggest that declines in lake trout PCBs will be in the range of 5-10% assuming conditions similar to recent years. This rate of decline will be difficult to discern without adequate data collection. If sufficient data are not gathered to document further declines, then the relaxation of lake trout consumption advisories is indeed a long-term prospect.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es034610l,"Stow, CA; Lamon, EC; Qian, SS; Schrank, CS",2004,Article,Environ.

325,"A spatial, Markovian model of rangeland grasshopper (Orthoptera : Acrididae) population dynamics: Do long-term benefits justify suppression of infestations?","Using 49 yr of rangeland grasshopper (Orthoptera: Acrididae) survey data for Wyoming digitized into a spatially explicit format, we constructed a two-state (infested or uninfested) Markov chain model to evaluate the probabilities of population changes between states at the scale of 1 km(2). Our analyses revealed that only very limited areas of Wyoming are likely to support multiyear infestations of rangeland grasshoppers. Across the state, 91% of the land has a >50% probability of a transition from infested to uninfested conditions from one year to the next. Considering only the land that has ever been infested by grasshoppers, 55% of this area was found to have a >90% probability of becoming uninfested in the year after an infestation. The life expectancy of a grasshopper infestation in Wyoming is generally <2 yr, and large portions of the state can expect infestations to persist for <1 yr. Although rangeland grasshopper infestations are unlikely to persist for >1-2 yr, uninfested conditions are also unlikely to last. Of the land that has ever been infested, uninfested conditions are expected to persist for less than or equal to10 yr on 36% of the area. Thus, rangeland grasshopper outbreaks are highly erratic events, with either infested or uninfested conditions lasting for short periods. Contrary to previous analyses at much coarser spatial scales, the probability of rangeland grasshopper infestations persisting for multiple years appears to be quite low. As such, for most of Wyoming there is little basis for prorating the benefits of control beyond the year of treatment.",https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-33.2.257,"Zimmerman, KM; Lockwood, JA; Latchininsky, AV",2004,Article,Environ.

6,"Cross-scale interactions, nonlinearities, and forecasting catastrophic events","Catastrophic events share characteristic nonlinear behaviors that are often generated by cross-scale interactions and feedbacks among system elements. These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) EcoL Monogr. 62, 447-502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L. M. & Tucker, C. J. (1999) Science 286, 1537-1540]. These approaches rarely have ventured beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403822101,"Peters, DPC; Pielke, RA; Bestelmeyer, BT; Allen, CD; Munson-McGee, S; Havstad, KM",2004,Article,Proc.

169,Efficient Kalman filter techniques for the assimilation of tide gauge data in three-dimensional modeling of the North Sea and Baltic Sea system,"Data assimilation in operational forecasting systems is a discipline undergoing rapid development. Despite the ever increasing computational resources, it requires efficient as well as robust assimilation schemes to support online prediction products. The parameter considered for assimilation here is water levels from tide gauge stations. The assimilation approach is Kalman filter based and examines the combination of the Ensemble Kalman Filter with spatial and dynamic regularization techniques. Further, both a Steady Kalman gain approximation and a dynamically evolving Kalman gain are considered. The estimation skill of the various assimilation schemes is assessed in a 4-week hindcast experiment using a setup of an operational model in the North Sea and Baltic Sea system. The computationally efficient dynamic regularization works very well and is to be encouraged for water level nowcasts. Distance regularization gives much improved results in data sparse areas, while maintaining performance in areas with a denser distribution of tide gauges.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2003JC002144,"Sorensen, JVT; Madsen, H; Madsen, H",2004,Article,J.

404,Temporal changes in the Yadkin River flow versus suspended sediment concentration relationship,"Dynamic linear models (DLM) and seasonal trend decomposition (STL) using local regression, or LOESS, were used to analyze the 50-year time series of suspended sediment concentrations for the Yadkin River, measured at the U.S. Geological Survey station at Yadkin College, North Carolina. A DLM with constant trend, seasonality, and a log(10) streamflow regressor provided the best model to predict monthly mean log(10) suspended sediment concentrations, based on the forecast log likelihood. Using DLM, there was evidence (odds approximately 69:1) that the log(10) streamflow versus log(10) suspended sediment concentration relationship has changed, with an approximate 20 percent increase in the log(10) streamflow coefficient over the period 1981 to 1996. However, sediment concentrations in the Yadkin River have decreased during the decade of the 1990s, which has been accompanied by a concomitant increase in streamflow variability. Although STL has been shown to be a versatile trend analysis technique, DLM is shown to be more suitable for discovery and inference of structural changes (trends) in the model coefficient describing the relationship between flow and sediment concentration.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01581.x,"Lamon, EC; Qian, SS; Richter, DD",2004,Article,J.

430,Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency,"Water availability limits plant growth and production in almost all terrestrial ecosystems(1-5). However, biomes differ substantially in sensitivity of aboveground net primary production ( ANPP) to between-year variation in precipitation(6-8). Average rain-use efficiency ( RUE; ANPP/precipitation) also varies between biomes, supposedly because of differences in vegetation structure and/or biogeochemical constraints(8). Here we show that RUE decreases across biomes as mean annual precipitation increases. However, during the driest years at each site, there is convergence to a common maximum RUE (RUEmax) that is typical of arid ecosystems. RUEmax was also identified by experimentally altering the degree of limitation by water and other resources. Thus, in years when water is most limiting, deserts, grasslands and forests all exhibit the same rate of biomass production per unit rainfall, despite differences in physiognomy and site-level RUE. Global climate models(9,10) predict increased between-year variability in precipitation, more frequent extreme drought events, and changes in temperature. Forecasts of future ecosystem behaviour should take into account this convergent feature of terrestrial biomes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02561,"Huxman, TE; Smith, MD; Fay, PA; Knapp, AK; Shaw, MR; Loik, ME; Smith, SD; Tissue, DT; Zak, JC; Weltzin, JF; Pockman, WT; Sala, OE; Haddad, BM; Harte, J; Koch, GW; Schwinning, S; Small, EE; Williams, DG",2004,Article,Nature,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
247,"Performance of two stochastic approaches for forecasting water quality and streamflow data from Yesil iota rmak River, Turkey","This study evaluates the forecasting performance of two modeling approaches, ARIMA and Thomas-Fiering, for selected water quality constituents and streamflow of the Yesilurmak River at Durucasu monitoring station. For this purpose, 13-year (1984-1996) monthly time series records were used to obtain the best model of each water quality constituent and streamflow from both modeling approaches. The comparison of the mean and variance of 5-year (1997-2001) observed data vs. forecasted data from the selected best models showed that the pH model from Thomas-Fiering, and EC and Cl- models from ARIMA modeling approaches should be used with caution since the forecasting values from these models does not preserve the basic statistics of observed data in terms of mean. Also the results of forecast accuracy measures including root mean square error and mean absolute error calculated for two approaches indicated that between two approaches, for Yesilumak River Thomas-Fiering model presents more reliable forecasting of water quality constituents and streamflow than ARIMA model. &COPY; 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2004.11.001,"Kurunc, A; Yurekli, K; Cevik, O",2005,Article,Environ.

457,Using dispersion and mesoscale meteorological models to forecast pollen concentrations,"This work describes the results of research into a source-oriented pollen concentration forecasting technique. Tests were conducted using the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Penn State Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (MM5), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT_4) Model combined with the locations of oak trees and their aerial coverage from biogenic emissions land cover database version 3.1 (BELD3). Daily forecasts of pollen concentrations via MM5 and HYSPLIT_4 were made with 30-min increments and tested against 30-min oak pollen data collected by the St. Louis County Department of Health in Clayton, Missouri, for the month of April 2000. Results from these tests show that the combination of MM5 and HYSPLIT_4 with accurate source locations can provide short-term forecasts as indicated by the levels of forecast pollen and actual oak pollen levels, which follow similar profiles for the day. From the 30 individual pollen concentration forecasts, two example forecasts are presented. Additional studies need to be conducted to further validate these results, using an array of pollen collectors. A better understanding of the biology of pollen release is critical to improving these pollen concentration forecasts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

250,The use of numerical weather forecast model predictions as a source of data for irrigation modelling,"The use of numerical weather forecast model data as a source of data for soil moisture modelling was tested. Results show that the potential evaporation calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation can be estimated accurately using data obtained from the output of a high resolution numerical atmospheric model (HIRLAM, High Resolution Limited Area Model). The mean bias error was 0.26 mm for a 36-hour sum and the root mean square error was 2.14 mm. The evaporation obtained directly from HIRLAM was systematically smaller because this direct model output represents the real evaporation rather than the potential evaporation. The precipitation forecasts were less accurate. When the accuracy of parameters required for the calculation of potential evaporation were studied for one station, no serious bias was found. When two different irrigation models (AMBAV and SWAP) were run over one summer using either measured or HIRLAM data as the input, the results given by the models were quite similar regardless of input data source. The largest differences between the model outputs were caused by the formulation of crop and soil characteristics in the irrigation models.",https://doi.org/10.1017/S135048270500188X,"Venalainen, A; Salo, T; Fortelius, C",2005,Article,Meteorol.

156,Forecasting climate-induced changes in the survival of Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha),"Effective conservation and management of natural resources requires accurate predictions of ecosystem responses to future climate change, but environmental science has largely failed to produce these reliable forecasts. The future response of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to a changing environment and continued anthropogenic disturbance is of particular interest to the public because of their high economic, social, and cultural value. While numerous retrospective analyses show a strong correlation between past changes in the ocean environment and salmon production within the north Pacific, these correlations rarely make good predictions. Using a Bayesian time-series model to make successive 1-yr-ahead forecasts, we predicted changes in the ocean survival of Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) from indices of coastal ocean upwelling with a high degree of certainty (R-2 = 0.71). Furthermore, another form of the dynamic times-series model that used all of the available data indicated an even stronger coupling between smolt-to-adult survival and ocean upwelling in the spring and fall (R-2 = 0.96). This suggests that management policies directed at conserving this threatened stock of salmon need to explicitly address the important role of the ocean in driving future salmon survival.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2005.00346.x,"Scheuerell, MD; Williams, JG",2005,Article,Fish Oceanogr.,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
314,Operational multivariate ocean data assimilation,"A fully three-dimensional, multivariate, optimum-interpolation ocean data assimilation system has been developed that produces simultaneous analyses of temperature, salinity, geopotential and vector velocity. The system is run in real-time, and can be executed as a stand-alone analysis or cycled with an ocean forecast model in a sequential incremental update cycle. Additional capabilities have been built into the system, including flow-dependent background-error correlations and background-error variances that vary in space and evolve from one analysis cycle to the next. The ocean data types assimilated include: remotely sensed sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and sea-ice concentration; plus in situ surface and sub-surface observations of temperature, salinity, and currents from a variety of sources, such as ships, buoys, expendable bathythermographs, conductivity-temperature-depth sensors, and profiling floats. An ocean data quality-control system is fully integrated with the multivariate analysis, and includes feedback of forecast fields and prediction errors in the quality control of new observations. The system is operational at the US Navy oceanographic production centres both in global and in regional applications. It is being implemented as the data assimilation component of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model as part of the US contribution to the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment, and in a limited-area ensemble-based forecasting system that will be used in an adaptive sampling, targeted observation application.",https://doi.org/10.1256/qj.05.105,"Cummings, JA",2005,Article; Proceedings Paper,Q.

32,Transmission of Phytophthora ramorum in mixed-evergreen forest in California,"During 2001 to 2003, the transmission biology of Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of sudden oak death, was studied in mixed-evergreen forest, a common forest type in northern, coastal California. Investigation of the sources of spore production focused on coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), dominant hosts that comprised 39.7 and 46.2% of the individuals at the study site, respectively. All tests for inoculum production from the surface of infected coast live oak bark or exudates from cankers were negative. In contrast, sporangia and chlamydospores were produced on the surface of infected bay laurel leaves. Mean number of zoospores produced from infected bay laurel leaves under natural field conditions during rainstorms was 1,173.0 +/- SE 301.48, and ranged as high as 5,200 spores/leaf. P. ramorum was recovered from rainwater, soil, litter, and streamwater during the mid-to late rainy season in all 3 years of the study. P. ramorum was not recovered from sporadic summer rains or soil and litter during the hot, dry summer months. Concentrations of inoculum in rainwater varied significantly from year to year and increased as the rainy season progressed for the two complete seasons that were studied. Potential dispersal distances were investigated for rainwater, soil, and streamwater. In rainwater, inoculum moved 5 and 10 m from the inoculum source. For soil, transmission of inoculum was demonstrated from infested soil to bay laurel green leaf litter, and from bay laurel green leaf litter to aerial leaves of bay laurel seedlings. One-third to one-half of the hikers tested at the study site during the rainy season also were carrying infested soil on their shoes. In streamwater, P. ramorum was recovered from an unforested site in pasture approximate to 1 km downstream of forest with inoculum sources. In total, these studies provide details on the production and spread of P. ramorum inoculum in mixed-evergreen forest to aid forecasting and managing disease transmission of this environmentally destructive pathogen.",https://doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-0587,"Davidson, JM; Wickland, AC; Patterson, HA; Falk, KR; Rizzo, DM",2005,Article,Phytopathology,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
130,Input determination for neural network models in water resources applications. Part 1 - background and methodology,"The use of artificial neural network (ANN) models in water resources applications has grown considerably over the last decade. However, an important step in the ANN modelling methodology that has received little attention is the selection of appropriate model inputs. This article is the first in a two-part series published in this issue and addresses the lack of a suitable input determintion methodology for ANN models in water resources applications. The current state of input determination is reviewed and two input determination methodologies are presented. The first method is a model-free approach, which utilises a measure of the mutual information criterion to characterise the dependence between a potential model input and the output variable. To facilitate the calculation of dependence in the case of multiple inputs, a partial measure of the mutual information criterion is us In the second method, a self-organizing map (SOM) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and obtain independent inputs. To determine which inputs have a significant relationship with the output (dependent) variable. a hybrid genetic algorithm and general regression neural network (GAGRNN) is used. Both input determination techniques are tested on a number of synthetic data sets. where the dependence attributes were known a priori. In the second paper of the series, the input determination methodology is applied to a real-world case study in order to determine suitable model inputs for forecasting salinity in the River Murray, South Australia, 14 days in advance.

360,The mass of the atmosphere: A constraint on global analyses,"The total mass of the atmosphere varies mainly from changes in water vapor loading; the former is proportional to global mean surface pressure and the water vapor component is computed directly from specific humidity and precipitable water using the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analyses (ERA-40). Their difference, the mass of the dry atmosphere, is estimated to be constant for the equivalent surface pressure to within 0.01 hPa based on changes in atmospheric composition. Global reanalyses satisfy this constraint for monthly means for 1979-2001 with a standard deviation of 0.065 hPa. New estimates of the total mass of the atmosphere and its dry component, and their corresponding surface pressures, are larger than previous estimates owing to new topography of the earth's surface that is 5.5 m lower for the global mean. Global mean total surface pressure is 985.50 hPa, 0.9 hPa higher than previous best estimates. The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480 X 10(18) kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5 X 10(15) kg depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; this is somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27 X 10(16) kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 +/- 0.0003 X 10(18) kg. The water vapor contribution varies with an annual cycle of 0.29-hPa, a maximum in July of 2.62 hPa, and a minimum in December of 2.33 hPa, although the total global surface pressure has a slightly smaller range. During the 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Ninio events, water vapor amounts and thus total mass increased by about 0.1 hPa in surface pressure or 0.5 X 10(15) kg for several months. Some evidence exists for slight decreases following the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and also for upward trends associated with increasing global mean temperatures, but uncertainties due to the changing observing system compromise the evidence. The physical constraint of conservation of dry air mass is violated in the reanalyses with increasing magnitude prior to the assimilation of satellite data in both ERA-40 and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalyses. The problem areas are shown to occur especially over the Southern Oceans. Substantial spurious changes are also found in surface pressures due to water vapor, especially in the Tropics and subtropics prior to 1979.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-3299.1,"Trenberth, KE; Smith, L",2005,Article,J.

Risk analyses for accidental introductions of ruffe to inland lakes should focus on the chance of establishment for small introductions such as those that would result from transporting ruffe as bait. Here I use Akaike's Information Criterion to select a population growth model for ruffe based on observed population dynamics during the invasion of Loch Lomond, Scotland. This population is regulated by a high carrying capacity and Allee effects were undetected. Parameter estimates obtained from this population forecast that the chance of establishment for possible introductions of ruffe to inland lakes in North America is high. A model for ruffe winter survival suggests that survivorship between introductions and spawning may be an important determinant of establishment success, but that the chance of establishment is high for introductions of only a few individuals. To prevent invasions of ruffe in inland waters, release of ruffe, whether intentional or accidental, should not be tolerated.",https://doi.org/10.1139/F05-014,"Drake, JM",2005,Article,Can. J. Fish.

7,A regional ocean modeling system for the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory,"A coastal ocean forecasting system was developed for the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO) on New Jersey's inner shelf. The forecast system comprised an ocean model, the Regional Ocean Modeling System, forced by a high-resolution atmospheric forecast, with assimilation of ocean data from ships and coastal radar systems. The forecasts were used to aid the deployment of real-time adaptive sampling observing systems during the July 2001 Coastal Predictive Skill Experiment. Temperature and salinity assimilation data were prepared by optimal interpolation of shipboard towed-body data. Surface current observations from coastal radar were projected vertically for assimilation using a statistically based extrapolation. The assimilation methods tested with the operational forecast system in July 2001 were continuous nudging and intermittent melding of the model forecast and gridded data. Observations from a validation array of current meter and thermistor moorings deployed on a cross-shore line through the center of the LEO intensive observing area were used to formulate a set of quantitative model skill metrics that focused on aspects of the two-layer wind-driven upwelling and downwelling circulation that characterizes ocean dynamics during the stratified summer season along this coast. An ensemble of model and data assimilation configurations were tested, showing that the k profile parameterization for vertical turbulence closure, and assimilation by intermittent melding, comprised the forecast system with the more significant skill as measured by the mean squared error of the validation metric time series.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2003JC002218,"Wilkin, JL; Arango, HG; Haidvogel, DB; Lichtenwalner, CS; Glenn, SM; Hedstrom, KS",2005,Article,J.

242,Real time observations of coastal algal blooms by an early warning system,"In eutrophic sub-tropical coastal waters around Hong Kong, phytoplankton or unicellular microalgae can grow rapidly to very high concentrations under favourable environmental conditions. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have led to massive fish kills, hypoxia, and beach closures. However, to date the causality and mechanism of coastal algal blooms are still poorly understood. A remotely controlled autonomous real time field monitoring system has been developed to continuously track the changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, dissolved oxygen and other hydro-meteorological variables at two representative mariculture zones. The system can give an alarm when a bloom is detected, so that timely manual water quality sampling can be carried out to supplement the telemetric data. During 2000-2003, the system has successfully tracked 19 algal blooms. In the shallow weakly flushed coastal water (depth 7-10 m, tidal current 5-19 cm s(-1)), the bloom is short-lived, typically lasting a few days to over a week, with chlorophyll and DO concentrations in the range of 20-40 mg m(-3) and 2-15 g m(-3), respectively. It is found that: (1) the chlorophyll concentration is strongly correlated with its past values in the previous week, suggesting an auto-regressive type of algal dynamics; (2) the dissolved oxygen can reach highly super-saturated levels (12 g m(-3)) during a diatom bloom, and decreases to below 4 g m(-3) at the tail of the growth phase; (3) in contrast, a dinoflagellate bloom is characterized by a much more pronounced vertical structure. Diel vertical migration and aggregation to dense layers are clearly observed. Significant dissolved oxygen consumption is associated with the migration, resulting in DO drops by as much as 6 g m(-3) during the bloom; (4) the predominance of diatoms and dinoflagellates at the two sites can be explained in terms of the different hydrographic and nutrient conditions (the N:P ratio). Net algal growth rate, sinking and swimming velocities are derived from the in situ bloom data. The 4-year high frequency data set provides a basis for development of models for forecast of harmful algal blooms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

432,"Transport of airborne pollen into the city of Thessaloniki: the effects of wind direction, speed and persistence","We examined the effect of the wind vector analyzed into its three components (direction, speed and persistence), on the circulation of pollen from different plant taxa prominent in the Thessaloniki area for a 4-year period (1996-1999). These plant taxa were Ambrosia spp., Artemisia spp., Chenopodiaceae, Corylus spp., Cupressaceae, Olea europaea, Pinaceae, Platanus spp., Poaceae, Populus spp., Quercus spp., and Urticaceae. Airborne pollen of Cupressaceae, Urticaceae, Quercus spp. and O. europaea make up approximately 70% of the total average annual pollen counts. The set of data that we worked with represented days without precipitation and time intervals during which winds blew from the same direction for at least 4 consecutive hours. We did this in order to study the effect of the different wind components independently of precipitation, and to avoid secondary effects produced by pollen resuspension phenomena. Factorial regression analysis among the summed bi-hourly pollen counts for each taxon and the values of wind speed and persistence per wind direction gave significant results in 22 cases (combinations of plant taxa and wind directions). The pollen concentrations of all taxa correlated significantly with at least one of the three wind components. In seven out of the 22 taxon-wind direction combinations, the pollen counts correlated positively with wind persistence, whereas this was the case for only two of the taxon-wind speed combinations. In seven cases, pollen counts correlated with the interaction effect of wind speed and persistence. This shows the importance of wind persistence in pollen transport, particularly when weak winds prevail for a considerable part of the year, as is the case for Thessaloniki.

70,Using Bayesian model averaging to calibrate forecast ensembles,"Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members;, this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January-June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90% BMA prediction intervals were 66% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.",https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR2906.1,"Raftery, AE; Gneiting, T; Balabdaoui, F; Polakowski, M",2005,Article,Mon.

19,Limits to the use of environmental indices to reduce risk and/or increase yield in the South African anchovy fishery,"Environmental indices that provide short-term predictions of recruitment have the potential to improve the average yield from highly productive resources that sustain recruit fisheries without an associated increase in risk (of resource 'collapse'). This is particularly true for cases where a measurement of recruitment is not available until after substantial fishing on this recruitment has already taken place. The South African anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resource reflects such a situation, and forms the basis for a simulation study to investigate the benefits of using environmental indices to set appropriate Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Simulations, based on a 'management procedure' (sensu the International Whaling Commission), investigate how such benefits are related to the proportion of variation in recruitment explained by the environmental index. Furthermore, they evaluate to what extent these benefits are compromised by uncertainties related to the degrees of freedom effect (over-fitting data), the selection of explanatory variables (danger of spurious correlations), and errors in the values of explanatory variables (including measurement error). Five recruitment prediction models that incorporate increasing numbers of these uncertainties are investigated. These predictions are used to adjust TACs depending on whether they indicate forthcoming recruitment to be in the top or bottom third of the distribution of possible recruitment values. Results indicate that an environmental index needs to explain roughly 50 % or more of the total variation in recruitment (r(2) >= 0.5) before the management procedure starts showing benefits in terms of the summary performance statistics for risk and average catch. Comparable benefits are possible at a lower r(2) value when TAC constraints are removed, but there is then a large associated increase in interannual catch variation. When r(2) is low, performance in terms of average catch may prove worse if attempting to take account of an environmental variable in setting the TAC than ignoring it.",https://doi.org/10.2989/18142320509504078,"De Oliveira, JAA; Butterworth, DS",2005,Article,Afr.

279,A model to predict climate-change impact on fish catch in the world oceans,"Water temperature plays a very important role in fish production. The assessment of the impact of water-temperature changes on fish catches in world fishery is essential for the sustainable management of world fishery resources. Fish catch includes different species, but using information analysis, it is shown that total fish catch can be used without significant loss of information about the dynamic properties of the system. A new method for the forecasting of the fish catch of the major fishing areas in the world's oceans under global climate change (temperature) has been developed. This method predicts the tendency (increase or decrease) for fish catch, with quantitative predictor's power, if the temperature is known. This method has been applied to the Indian Ocean to assess the climate-change impact on fish catch. Based on the temperatures predicted using the CLIMate-BiospheRE model for the years 2000-2100, a decrease of fish catch in the Indian Ocean, with the confidence of the predictor's power at >= 90%, has been predicted.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2005.851345,"Biswas, BK; Svirezhev, YA; Bala, BK",2005,Article,IEEE Trans.

192,"Time series forecasting of cyanobacteria blooms in the Crestuma Reservoir (Douro River, Portugal) using artificial neural networks","In this work, time series neural networks were used to predict the occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in Crestuma Reservoir, which is an important potable water supply for the Porto region, located in the north of Portugal. These models can potentially be used to provide water treatment plant operators with an early warning for developing cyanobacteria blooms. Physical, chemical, and biological parameters were collected at Crestuma Reservoir from 1999 to 2002. The data set was then divided into three independent time series, each with a fortnightly periodicity. One training series was used to ""teach"" the neural networks to predict results. Another series was used to verify the results, and to avoid over-fitting of the data. An additional independently collected data series was then used to test the efficacy of the model for predicting the abundance of cyanobacteria. All of the models tested in this study incorporated a prediction time (look-ahead parameter) equal to the sampling interval (two weeks). Various lag periods, from 2 to 52 weeks, were also investigated. The best model produced in this study provided the following correlations between the target and forecast values in the training, verification, and validation series: 1.000 (P = 0.000), 0.802 (P = 0.000), and 0.773 (P = 0.001), respectively. By applying this model to the three-year data set, we were able to predict fluctuations in cyanobacteria abundance in the Crestuma Reservoir, with a high level of precision. By incorporating a lag-period of eight weeks, we were able to detect secondary fluctuations in cyanobacterial abundance over the annual cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-005-0074-9,"Teles, LO; Vasconcelos, V; Teles, LO; Pereira, E; Saker, M; Vasconcelos, V",2006,Article,Environ.

284,Time-series modeling of fishery landings using ARIMA models and Fuzzy Expected Intervals software,"Forecasting, using historic time-series data, has become an important tool for fisheries management. ARIMA modeling, Modeling for Optimal Forecasting techniques and Decision Support Systems based on fuzzy mathematics may be used to predict the general trend of a given fish landings time-series with increased reliability and accuracy. The present paper applies these three modeling methods to forecast anchovy fish catches landed in a given port (Thessaloniki, Greece) during 1979-2000 and hake and bonito total fish catches during 1982-2000. The paper attempts to assess the model's accuracy by comparing model results to the actual monthly fish catches of the year 2000. According to the measures of forecasting accuracy established, the best forecasting performance for anchovy was shown by the DSS model (MAPE = 28.06%, RMSE = 76.56, U-statistic = 0.67 and R-2 = 0.69). The optimal forecasting technique of genetic modeling improved significantly the forecasting values obtained by the selected ARIMA model. Similarly, the DSS model showed a noteworthy forecasting efficiency for the prediction of hake landings, during the year 2000 (MAPE = 2.88%, RMSE = 13.75, U-statistic = 0.19 and R-2 = 0.98), as compared to the other two modeling techniques. Optimal forecasting produced by combined modeling scored better than application of the simple ARIMA model. Overall, DSS results showed that the Fuzzy Expected Intervals methodology could be used as a very reliable tool for short-term predictions of fishery landings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

31,Time series analysis and forecasting techniques applied on loliginid and ommastrephid landings in Greek waters,"Time series analysis techniques (ARIMA models), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Bayesian dynamic models were used to forecast annual loliginid and ommastrephid landings recorded from the most important fishing ports in the Northern Aegean Sea (1984-1999). The techniques were evaluated based on their efficiency to forecast and their ability to utilise auxiliary environmental information. Applying a ""stepwise modelling"" technique, namely by adding stepwise predictors and comparing the quality of fit, certain inferences concerning the importance of the predictors were made. The ARIMA models predicted the test data very precisely (high R-2), especially if the target time series contained a strong autoregressive character, after they were first differenced to obtain stationarity (R-2 > 0.96). The disadvantage of the ARIMA, as with most statistical models, is their assumption that the relationships and system parameters remain the same across the observation and forecasting periods. The influence of temperature on catches was mainly investigated by applying neural models, which predicted the monthly landings with high precision (R-2 = 0.89), even when incorporating in the model exclusively monthly SST descriptors. Similarly, ANN models of annual landings containing monthly mean temperatures provided high precision (R-2 = 0.87) and valuable inference concerning the possible effect of the SST in certain months. Bayesian dynamic models also provided a high precision (R-2 = 0.96). They combined the information of both environmental and landing time series, namely the monthly mean temperatures and the monthly seasonality of the landings. The impact factors estimated from the model have the form of time series representing the temperature effect. The results reveal that both the monthly and the annual landings can be predicted and that the Bayesian model is the best performer overall, characterised by a higher number of stable forecasts, and forecasts with higher precision and accuracy, than the other methods. It is evident, from application of the ""stepwise modelling"" technique, that the incorporation of temperature descriptors can significantly improve the model performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

187,Flow forecasting for a Hawaii stream using rating curves and neural networks,"This paper illustrates the applications of feedforward back propagation and radial basis function neural networks for flow prediction of a Hawaii stream and one of its tributaries that render flash flood behavior. Stream flow is estimated from stream stage, width, cross-sectional area, and mean velocity at the gaging station. Since measurement of mean velocity is time-consuming, expensive, and dangerous during high flows, alternative methods of flow forecasting are needed. Traditionally, hydrologists use rating curves for flow estimates. The United States Geological Survey has been estimating stream discharge using conventional rating curves for Hawaii streams. The rating curves are developed from records of measured stream stage and discharge. Clearly, the rating curves are set up for cases in which stream stage is the only input and discharge is the output. However, major limitations of using a rating curve are that the effects of hysteresis (i.e. loop-rating) are not taken into account, and as a result the prediction accuracy is lost when the stream changes its flow behavior. As an alternative method, artificial neural networks are proposed. The performances of artificial neural networks are examined for two input data sets: one set with and the other set without mean velocity, but both including stream stage, width, and cross-sectional area for two gaging stations on the stream. The results show that for both input data sets, well-optimized neural networks can outperform rating curves for discharge forecasting. Additionally, it is worth noting that neural networks are capable of predicting the loop-rating curve, which is impossible to predict using conventional rating curves. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

436,Global traffic and disease vector dispersal,"The expansion of global air travel and seaborne trade overcomes geographic barriers to insect disease vectors, enabling them to move great distances in short periods of time. Here we apply a coupled human-environment framework to describe the historical spread of Aedes albopictus, a competent mosquito vector of 22 arboviruses in the laboratory. We contrast this dispersal with the relatively unchanged distribution of Anopheles gambiae and examine possible future movements of this malaria vector. We use a comprehensive database of international ship and aircraft traffic movements, combined with climatic information, to remap the global transportation network in terms of disease vector suitability and accessibility. The expansion of the range of Ae. albopictus proved to be surprisingly predictable using this combination of climate and traffic data. Traffic volumes were more than twice as high on shipping routes running from the historical distribution of Ae. albopictus to ports where it has established in comparison with routes to climatically similar ports where it has yet to invade. In contrast, An. gambiae has rarely spread from Africa, which we suggest is partly due to the low volume of sea traffic from the continent and, until very recently, a European destination for most flights.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0508391103,"Tatem, AJ; Hay, SI; Rogers, DJ",2006,Article,Proc.

426,Towards numerical forecasting of long-range air transport of birch pollen: theoretical considerations and a feasibility study,"This paper considers the feasibility of numerical simulation of large-scale atmospheric transport of allergenic pollen. It is shown that at least small grains, such as birch pollen, can stay in the air for a few days, which leads to a characteristic scale for their transport of similar to 10(3) km. The analytical consideration confirmed the applicability of existing dispersion models to the pollen transport task and provided some reference parameterizations of the key processes, including dry and wet deposition. The results were applied to the Finnish Emergency Dispersion Modelling System (SILAM), which was then used to analyze pollen transport to Finland during spring time in 2002-2004. Solutions of the inverse problems (source apportionment) showed that the main source areas, from which the birch flowering can affect Finnish territory, are the Baltic States, Russia, Germany, Poland, and Sweden-depending on the particular meteorological situation. Actual forecasting of pollen dispersion required a birch forest map of Europe and a unified European model for birch flowering, both of which were nonexistent before this study. A map was compiled from the national forest inventories of Western Europe and satellite images of broadleaf forests. The flowering model was based on the mean climatological dates for the onset of birch forests rather than conditions of any specific year. Utilization of probability forecasting somewhat alleviated the problem, but the development of a European-wide flowering model remains the main obstacle for real-time forecasting of large-scale pollen distribution.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-006-0027-x,"Sofiev, M; Siljamo, P; Ranta, H; Rantio-Lehtimaki, A",2006,Article,Int.

196,Prediction of the concentration of chlorophyll-alpha for Liuhai urban lakes in Beijing City,"The weekly water quality monitor data of Liuhai lakes between April 2003 and November 2004 in Beijing City were used as an example to build an artificial neural networks (ANN) model and a multi-varieties regression model respectively for predicting the fresh water algae bloom. The different predicted abilities of the two methods in Liuhai lakes were compared. A principle analysis method was first used to select the input variables of the models to avoid the phenomenon of collinearity in the data. The results showed that the input variables for the artificial neural networks were T, TP, transparency(SD), DO, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), pH and the output variable was Chl-a. A three layer Levenberg-Marguardt feed forward learning algorithm in ANN was used to model the eutrophication process of Liuhai lakes. 20 nodes in hidden layer and I node of output for the ANN model had been optimized by trial and error method. A sensitivity analysis of the input variables was performed to evaluate their relative significance in determining the predicted values. The correlation coefficient between predicted value and observed value in all data and in test data were 0.717 and 0.816 respectively in the artificial neural networks. The stepwise regression method was used to simulate the linear relation between Chl-a and temperature, of which the correlation coefficient was 0.213. By comparing the results of the two models, it was found that neural network models were able to simulate non-linear behavior in the water eutrophication process of Liuhai lakes reasonably and could successfully estimate some extreme values from calibration and test data sets.",NA,"Zeng, Y; Yang, ZF; Liu, JF",2006,Article,J.

276,Long distance pollen transport cause problems for determining the timing of birch pollen season in Fennoscandia by using phenological observations,"The male flowering and leaf bud burst of birch take place almost simultaneously, suggesting that the observations of leaf bud burst could be used to determine the timing of birch pollen release. However, long-distance transport of birch pollen before the onset of local flowering may complicate the utilization of phenological observations in pollen forecasting. We compared the timing of leaf bud burst of silver birch with the timing of the stages of birch pollen season during an eight year period (1997-2004) at five sites in Finland. The stages of the birch pollen season were defined using four different thresholds: 1) the first date of the earliest three-day period with airborne birch pollen counts exceeding 10 grains m(-3) air; and the dates when the accumulated pollen sum reaches 2) 5%; 3) 50% and 4) 95% of the annual total. Atmospheric modelling was used to determine the source areas for the observed long-distance transported pollen, and the exploitability of phenological observations in pollen forecasting was evaluated. Pair-wise comparisons of means indicate that the timing of leaf bud burst fell closest to the date when the accumulated pollen sum reached 5% of the annual total, and did not differ significantly from it at any site (p < 0.05; Student-Newman-Keuls test). It was found that the timing of leaf bud burst of silver birch overlaps with the first half of the main birch pollen season. However, phenological observations alone do not suffice to determine the timing of the main birch pollen season because of long-distance transport of birch pollen.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00173130600984740,"Ranta, H; Kubin, E; Siljamo, P; Sofiev, M; Linkosalo, T; Oksanen, A; Bondestam, K",2006,Article,Grana,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
437,Quercus pollen season dynamics in the Iberian Peninsula: Response to meteorological parameters and possible consequences of climate change,"The main characteristics of the Quercus pollination season were studied in 14 different localities of the Iberian Peninsula from 1992-2004. Results show that Quercus flowering season has tended to start earlier in recent years. probably due to the increased temperatures in the pre-flowering period, detected at study sites over the second half of the 20th century. A Growing Degree Days forecasting model was used. together with future meteorological data forecast using the Regional Climate Model developed by the Hadley Meteorological Centre, in order to determine the expected advance in the start of Quercus pollination in future years. At each study site, airborne pollen curves presented a similar pattern in all study years, with different peaks over the season attributable in many cases to the presence of several species. High pollen concentrations were recorded, particularly at Mediterranean sites. This study also proposes forecasting models to predict both daily pollen values and annual pollen emission. All models were externally validated using data for 2001 and 2004, with acceptable results. Finally, the impact of the highly-likely climate change on Iberian Quercus pollen concentration values was studied by applying RCM meteorological data for different future years, 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2099. Results indicate that under a doubled CO2 scenario at the end of the 21st century Quercus pollination season could start on average one month earlier and airborne pollen concentrations will increase by 50% with respect to current levels, with higher values in Mediterranean inland areas.",NA,"Garcia-Mozo, H; Galan, C; Jato, V; Belmonte, J; de la Guardia, CD; Fernandez, D; Gutierrez, M; Aira, MJ; Roure, JM; Ruiz, L; Trigo, MM; Dominguez-Vilches, E",2006,Article,Ann.

91,"Modeling phytoplankton abundance in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron: Using artificial neural networks to discern functional influence of environmental variables and relevance to a great lakes observing system","Phytoplankton abundance, as chl a, in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron was modeled using artificial neural networks. Suites of abiotic variables served as predictors for the trends/patterns in chl a concentrations. Spatial and temporal gradients of sampling stations throughout the bay were evident, with physical/chemical differences arising from hydrological/meteorological forcing and zebra mussel recruitment. Chlorophyll a concentrations displayed corresponding disparities; concentrations differed between the inner and outer bays and varied intra- and inter-annually. Trained networks reproduced the intrinsic variance and magnitude of chl a dynamics. Modeled-measured concentrations best approximated a 1:1 relationship in a hybrid network incorporating both supervised and unsupervised training whereas concentrations greater than 15 mu g/L were underestimated in networks utilizing only supervised training, likely because of inadequate training data. Variables indicative of phytoplankton nutrition, acting as proxy measurements of algal biomass, and/or corresponding to descriptors of hydrological and meteorological forcing had the greatest influence upon modeled concentrations. A conjunctive decision tree and a novel sensitivity analysis provided rule-based information and comprehensible interpretation of relationships among multiple predictor variables. From this, the ""knowledge"" embedded in trained networks proved extractable and usable for ecological theory generation and/or decision making within water-quality problem solving.

251,"Neural net modeling of estuarine indicators: Hindcasting phytoplankton biomass and net ecosystem production in the Neuse (North Carolina) and Trout (Florida) Rivers, USA","Phytoplankton biomass, as chlorophyll (Chl) a, and net ecosystem production (NEP), were modeled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Chl a varied seasonally and along a saline gradient throughout the Neuse River (North Carolina). NEP was extremely dynamic in the Trout River (Florida), with phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions occurring over short-term intervals. Physical and chemical variables, arising from meteorological and hydrological conditions, created spatial and/or temporal gradients in both systems and served as interacting predictors for the trends/patterns of Chi a and NEP. ANNs outperformed comparable linear regression models and reliably modeled Chi a concentrations less than 20 mu g L-1 and NEP values, denoting the apparent non-linear interactions among abiotic and indicator variables. ANNs underestimated Chi a concentrations greater than 20 mu g L-1, likely due to the periodicity of data acquisition not being sufficient to generalize system variability, the designated 'lag' effect for variables not being adequate to portray estuarine flow dynamics, the exclusion of (one or more) variables that would have improved prediction, and/or an unrealistic expectation of network performance. Variables indicative of meteorological and hydrological forcing and/or proxy measurements of phytoplankton had the greatest relative impact on prediction of Chl a and NEP. Except for their predictive capability, ANNs might appear to be of limited value for ecological applications and problem solving; interpreting the absolute impact of and/or interacting relationships among network variables is intrinsically difficult. Statistical methods or 'rule extraction' algorithms that convey comprehensible network interpretation are needed prior to the routine use of ANNs in programs assessing and/or forecasting the response of biotic indicators to perturbation or for a means to discern estuarine function.

408,Hydroinformatics techniques in eco-environmental modelling and management,"The high complexity of aquatic ecosystems and the multiple processes involved, make the development of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental models a challenging subject. Conventionally, computer-based models use a mathematical formulation for the processes involved which are then solved by numerical methods. These models are often derived based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity and conservation principles of mass, momentum and energy. Development of these models often demands a clear understanding of the processes involved. However, the above assumptions are easily violated when spatial heterogeneity, individual species behaviour and local interactions play a significant role in the system dynamics. In particular for eco-environmental systems, knowledge on local interactions that determine the overall system behaviour is not always available. Although the rapid advances of data-driven techniques have recently made great contributions to water-environment related research, data on ecosystems are often quite limited, which restricts the application of data mining methods to eco-environmental system modelling. In addition, no modelling - also not black-box modelling - can be undertaken without having at least some understanding of the basic processes and mechanisms involved. It is always advisable to start exploring any dataset using conventional statistical techniques, as elaborated in this paper for a case study on Western Xiamen Bay, China. Neural network trimming was then used to establish the dominant factors; it was shown that a relatively simple ANN model was quite capable of capturing the essential features, provided the right input parameters are chosen. Examples of integrated approaches to ecohydraulics modelling coupling formulations with cellular automata and physical equations with fuzzy rules are presented for applications on eutrophication modelling of Taihu Lake in China, competitive growths and colonization of two underwater macrophytes in Lake Veluwe in The Netherlands, and forecasting of algal blooms in the Dutch coastal waters on the North Sea. A mussel dynamics model developed for the Upper Mississippi River in the USA demonstrates the feasibility of individual based modelling in ecosystem dynamics. Numerical models are quite capable of simulating the abiotic aquatic environment, including complicated fluid flow and transport mechanisms. However, when it comes to simulating the biotic and ecosystem dynamics, the interaction of individual species with their environment, as well as the interactions amongst species, has to be taken into account. The future of ecohydraulics and eco-environmental modelling thus seems to lie in the integration of different paradigms and techniques, which is the core content of the hydroinformatics discipline.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2006.011,"Chen, QW; Morales-Chaves, Y; Li, H; Mynett, AE",2006,Article,J.

Daily weather data for the period 1984-1998 at eight meteorological stations representing a wide range of climatic conditions of China were used to compute the FAO-PM ET, and to serve as reference data sets for comparison with the variables obtained from daily weather forecast messages at the same locations and period. Several statistical indicators were used for the respective comparisons. The sunshine duration (n) estimated from the forecasted cloudiness agree well with those observed as indicated by the Willmott indices of agreement, d, and the determination coefficient, R-2, higher than 0.99 and 0.96, respectively, at all locations. The translation of wind speed scales into wind speed values shows adequate, with a relative error, RE, near 0.10 and high values for d and R-2. The comparison of the actual vapour pressure estimated from the minimum temperature and computed from air humidity observations yielded d and R-2 values higher than 0.85 for all the locations except one, Ejina, located in an and region. The estimated weather parameters were then used to compute the daily ETo, with the FAO-PM equation for the eight locations. The weather forecasted ETo estimates agree well with the ETo values computed with full data sets, with d and R-2 for all locations larger than 0.95 and 0.91, respectively. However, the accuracy of these ET, estimations depends upon the availability of accurate weather forecast messages. Results indicate that daily ET. predictions using the public weather forecast messages are appropriate to be used for real-time water allocation and irrigation management. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

162,A simple model for forecast of coastal algal blooms,"In eutrophic sub-tropical coastal waters around Hong Kong and South China, algal blooms (more often called red tides) due to the rapid growth of microscopic phytoplankton are often observed. Under favourable environmental conditions, these blooms can occur and subside over rather short time scales-in the order of days to a few weeks. Very often, these blooms are observed in weakly flushed coastal waters under calin wind conditions-with or without stratification. Based on high-frequency field observations of harmful algal blooms at two coastal mariculture zones in Hong Kong. a mathematical model has been developed to forecast algal blooms. The model accounts for algal growth, decay, settling, and vertical turbulent mixing, and adopts the same assumptions as the classical Riley, Stommel and Bumpus model (Riley, G.A., Stommel). H.. Bumpus, D.F., 1949. Quantitative ecology of the plankton of the western North Atlantic. Bulletin of the Bingham Oceanographic Collection Yale University 12. 1-169). It is shown that for algal blooms to occur, a vertical stability criterion, E < 4 mu l(2)/pi(2), must be satisfied, where E, mu, l are the vertical turbulent diffusivity, algal growth rate, and euphotic layer depth respectively. In addition, a minimum nutrient threshold concentration must be reached. Moreover, with a nutrient competition consideration, the type of bloom (caused by motile or non-motile species) can be classified. The model requires as input simple and readily available field measurements of water column transparency and nutrient concentration, and representative maximum algal growth rate of the motile and non-motile species. In addition, with the use of three-dimensional hydrodynamic circulation models. simple relations are derived to estimate the vertical mixing coefficient as a function of tidal range, wind speed, and density stratification. The model gives a quick assessment of the likelihood of algal bloom occurrence, and has been validated against field observations over a 4-year period. The model helps to explain the observed spatial and temporal patterns of bloom Occurrences in relation to the vertical turbulence and nutrient condition. The success of the model points the way to the development of real time management models for disaster mitigation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

66,Elucidation and short-term forecasting of microcystin concentrations in Lake Suwa (Japan) by means of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms,"Non-supervised artificial neural networks (ANN) and hybrid evolutionary algorithms (EA) were applied to analyse and model 12 years of limnological time-series data of the shallow hypertrophic Lake Suwa in Japan. The results have improved understanding of relationships between changing microcystin concentrations, Microcystis species abundances and annual rainfall intensity. The data analysis by non-supervised ANN revealed that total Microcystis abundance and extra-cellular microcystin concentrations in typical dry years are much higher than those in typical wet years. It also showed that high microcystin concentrations in dry years coincided with the dominance of the toxic Microcystis Viridis whilst in typical wet years non-toxic Microcystis ichthyoblabe were dominant. Hybrid EA were used to discover rule sets to explain and forecast the occurrence of high microcystin concentrations in relation to water quality and climate conditions. The results facilitated early warning by 3-days-ahead forecasting of microcystin concentrations based on limnological and meteorological input data, achieving an r(2) = 0.74 for testing.

13,Modeling and forecasting pelagic fish production using univariate and multivariate ARIMA models,"Univariate and multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were used to model and forecast the monthly pelagic production of fish species in the Mediterranean Sea during 1990-2005. Autocorrelation (AC) and partial autocorrelation (PAC) functions were estimated, which led to the identification and construction of seasonal ARIMA models, suitable in explaining the time series and forecasting the future catch per unit of effort (CPUE) values. Univariate and multivariate ARIMA models satisfactorily predicted the total pelagic fish production and the production of anchovy, sardine, and horse mackerel. The univariate ARIMA models demonstrated a good performance in terms of explained variability and predicting power. The current findings revealed a strong autoregressive character providing relatively high R-2 and satisfactory forecasts that were close to the recorded CPUE values. The present results also indicated that the multivariate ARIMA outperformed the univariate ARIMA models in terms of fitting accuracy. The opposite was evidenced when testing the forecasting accuracy of the two methods, where the univariate ARIMA models overall performed better than the multivariate models. The observed seasonal pattern in the monthly production series was attributed to the intrinsic nature of the pelagic fishery. As anchovy, sardine, and horse mackerel represent main target species in the Mediterranean pelagic fishery, the findings of the present study provided direct support for the potential use of accurate forecasts in decision making and fisheries management in the Mediterranean Sea.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01426.x,"Tsitsika, EV; Maravelias, CD; Haralabous, J",2007,Article,Fish.

441,Biophysical modelling and NDVI time series to project near-term forage supply: spectral analysis aided by wavelet denoising and ARIMA modelling,"Point-based biophysical simulation of forage production coupled with 1-km AVHRR NDVI data was used to determine the feasibility of projecting forage conditions 84 days into the future to support stocking decision making for livestock production using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with Box and Jenkins methodology. The study was conducted at three highly contrasting ecosystems in South Texas over the period 1989-2000. Wavelet transform was introduced as a mathematical tool to denoise the NDVI time series. The simulated forage production, NDVI and denoised NDVI (DeNDVI) were subject to spectral decomposition for the detection of periodicities. Spectral analysis revealed bimodal vegetation growth patterns in Southwestern Texas. A yearly cycle (364 days) of peak vegetation production was detected for the three study sites, another peak forage production was revealed by spectral analysis at 182 days following the first peak in vegetation production. A similar trend was found for the NDVI imageries sensing the study sites. Wavelet denoising of NDVI signal was effective in revealing clear periodicities in one study site where maximum variability of NDVI was noted. The Box and Jenkins ARIMA modelling approach was used as a forecasting method for near-term forage production to assist range managers in proactive operational stocking decisions to mitigate drought risk. Using denoised NDVI provided forage projections with the lowest standard error prediction (SEP) throughout the forecast 84-day periods. However, acceptable SEP was only achieved up to 6 weeks into a projection for the forage-only based forecasts. The ARIMA forecasting methodology appears to offer a new approach to help managers of livestock production through the creation of near real-time early warning systems. Using satellite-derived NDVI data as a covariate improved the forecast quality and reduced the standard error of forecast in three highly contrasting sites. Denoising the NDVI data using wavelet methods further improved the forecast quality in all study sites. The integration of AVHRR NDVI data and biophysical simulation of forage production appears a promising approach for assisting decision makers in a positive manner by assessing forage conditions in response to emerging weather conditions and near real-time projection of available forage for grazing animals.",https://doi.org/10.1080/01431160600954670,"Alhamad, MN; Stuth, J; Vannucci, M",2007,Article,Int.

50,Experimental implementation of an ensemble adjustment filter for an intermediate ENSO model,"The assimilation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies into a coupled ocean-atmosphere model of the tropical Pacific is investigated using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). The intermediate coupled model used here is the operational version of the Zebiak-Cane model, called LDEO5. The assimilation is applied as a means of estimating the true state of the system in the presence of incomplete observations of the state. In the first part of this study assimilation is performed under the ""perfect model"" assumption, where SST observations are synthetically derived from a trajectory of the model. The focus is on how and why changes in the filter parameters (ensemble size, covariance localization, and covariance inflation) affect the quality of the analysis. It is shown that isotropic covariance localization does not benefit the analysis even when a small number of ensemble members are used. These results suggest that destruction of the ""balance"" between variables caused by localization is more detrimental than spurious correlation due to small ensemble size. In the second part of this study the EAKF is used to assimilate an independent dataset of SST observations. The EAKF/Zebiak-Cane assimilation system is able to correctly estimate the phase and intensity of ENSO, as measured by the average SST anomaly in the eastern equatorial Pacific. A comparison of the analysis herein to independent wind stress and thermocline depth datasets suggests that even with the assimilation of only SST observations it is possible to reproduce over 70% of the interannual variability of thermocline depth in the eastern equatorial Pacific and off the coast of the Philippine Islands. The interannual variability of zonal wind stress in the central and western equatorial Pacific is also well correlated with independent observations ( R > 0.75).",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI4245.1,"Karspeck, AR; Anderson, JL",2007,Article,J.

466,System design and evaluation of coupled ensemble data assimilation for global oceanic climate studies,"A fully coupled data assimilation (CDA) system, consisting of an ensemble filter applied to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's global fully coupled climate model (CM2), has been developed to facilitate the detection and prediction of seasonal-to-multidecadal climate variability and climate trends. The assimilation provides a self-consistent, temporally continuous estimate of the coupled model state and its uncertainty, in the form of discrete ensemble members, which can be used directly to initialize probabilistic climate forecasts. Here, the CDA is evaluated using a series of perfect model experiments, in which a particular twentieth-century simulation-with temporally varying greenhouse gas and natural aerosol radiative forcings-serves as a ""truth"" from which observations are drawn, according to the actual ocean observing network for the twentieth century. These observations are then assimilated into a coupled model ensemble that is subjected only to preindustrial forcings. By examining how well this analysis ensemble reproduces the ""truth,"" the skill of the analysis system in recovering anthropogenically forced trends and natural climate variability is assessed, given the historical observing network. The assimilation successfully reconstructs the twentieth-century ocean heat content variability and trends in most locations. The experiments highlight the importance of maintaining key physical relationships among model fields, which are associated with water masses in the ocean and geostrophy in the atmosphere. For example, when only oceanic temperatures are assimilated, the ocean analysis is greatly improved by incorporating the temperature-salinity covariance provided by the analysis ensemble. Interestingly, wind observations are more helpful than atmospheric temperature observations for constructing the structure of the tropical atmosphere; the opposite holds for the extratropical atmosphere. The experiments indicate that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is difficult to constrain using the twentieth-century observational network, but there is hope that additional observations-including those from the newly deployed Argo profiles-may lessen this problem in the twenty-first century. The challenges for data assimilation of model systematic biases and evolving observing systems are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR3466.1,"Zhang, S; Harrison, MJ; Rosati, A; Wittenberg, A",2007,Article,Mon.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully used to model primary production and have recently been tested for the prediction of harmful algae blooms. In this study, we evaluated the performance of feed forward ANN models trained to predict D. acuminata blooms. ANN models were trained and tested using weekly data (5 previous weeks) of D. acuminata cell counts from eight stations of the Andalucia HAB monitoring programme in the coasts of Huelva between 1998 and 2004. Principal component analysis (PCA) were previously carried out to find out possible similarities within time series from each zone with the aim of reducing the number of areas to model. Our results show that ANN models with a low number of input variables are able to reproduce trends in D. acuminata population dynamics. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

280,"Fuzzy logic model of lake water level fluctuations in Lake Van, Turkey","Lake Van is one of the largest terminal lakes in the world. In recent years, significant lake level fluctuations have occurred and can be related to global climatic change. This fluctuation sometimes exhibits abrupt shifts. Floods originating from the lake can cause considerable damage and loss in agriculture and urban areas. Therefore, water level forecasting plays a significant role in planning and design. This study is aimed at predicting future lake levels from past rainfall amounts and water level records. A dynamical change of the lake level is evaluated by the fuzzy approach. The fuzzy inference system has the ability to use fuzzy membership functions that include the uncertainties of the concerned event. This method is applied for Lake Van, in east Turkey. Furthermore, model capabilities are compared with ARMAX model.

15,The contribution of long-distance transport to the presence of Ambrosia pollen in central northern Italy,"Ragweed is an allergenic weed of public health concern in several European countries. In Italy ragweed occurs prevalently in north-north-eastern regions, where sensitization is increasing. Because of the small diameter of pollen grains, ragweed pollen is often involved in episodes of long-range transport, as already shown in central Italy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of such transport by comparing pollen and meteorological data for two northern Italian cities (Parma and Mantova) with data from Pistoia and Florence in central Italy. In 2002 and 2004 peaks in ragweed pollen levels were detected in these four cities on the same day, and concentrations of the grains were above clinical thresholds. Weather-map analysis and computation of back-trajectories showed that air masses from eastern Europe might carry ragweed pollen to a wide area of central and northern Italy. These findings suggest that episodes of long-range transport of ragweed pollen could be clinically relevant, resulting in sensitization of a large number of people. The results might provide a basis for monitoring and forecasting periods of long-distance transport with the objective of reducing their effects on allergic patients.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10453-007-9060-4,"Cecchi, L; Malaspina, TT; Albertini, R; Zanca, M; Ridolo, E; Usberti, I; Morabito, M; Dall' Aglio, P; Orlandini, S",2007,Article,Aerobiologia,English,abby lewis,application to forecasting,NA,0,0,NA,,,NA
3,Development and application of crop growth simulation modelling in pest management,"Crop growth simulation models based on crop ecological and physiological processes, and coupled with pest damage mechanisms, are useful tools for analysing the interaction of pests with other biophysical components of agroecosystems. The use of simulation models in pest management started with the development of single-species population dynamics models in the late 1960s. Later, population dynamics models for bitrophic interactions between pests and natural enemies were devised. Crop growth simulation models were coupled with pest damage mechanisms in the mid-80s, but the approach was described as a one-way analysis of crop-pest interactions because these models accounted for pest effects on crop growth without the reverse being considered. A two-way approach for crop-pest interactions came into being with the interlinking of pest population dynamics models with crop growth simulation models in the 1990s. Pest management research is required to produce practical tools for developing tactics and strategies for pest management. Simulation models help to produce such tools and decision models. They are used for various applications, such as rationalizing pesticide use, pest risk analysis, pest zonation, analysis of climate change impact on pests, and assessing the effect of transgenic crops on the environment. These models have the potential to play even greater roles in the future.",https://doi.org/10.5367/000000007780223704,"Chander, S; Kalra, N; Aggarwal, PK",2007,Article,Outlook Agric.,English,abby lewis,review,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
373,Bayesian statistical data assimilation for ecosystem models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"This study considers advanced statistical approaches for sequential data assimilation. These are explored in the context of nowcasting and forecasting using nonlinear differential equation based marine ecosystem models assimilating sparse and noisy non-Gaussian multivatiate observations. The statistical framework uses a state space model with the goal of estimating the time evolving probability distribution of the ecosystem state. Assimilation of observations relies on stochastic dynamic prediction and Bayesian principles. In this study, a new sequential data assimilation approach is introduced based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The ecosystem state is represented by an ensemble, or sample, from which distributional properties, or summary statistical measures, can be derived. The Metropolis-Hastings based MCMC approach is compared and contrasted with two other sequential data assimilation approaches: sequential importance resampling, and the (approximate) ensemble Kalman filter (including computational comparisons). A simple illustrative application is provided based on a 0-D nonlinear plank-ton ecosystem model with multivariate non-Gaussian observations of the ecosystem state from a coastal ocean observatory. The MCMC approach is shown to be straightforward to implement and to effectively characterize the non-Gaussian ecosystem state in both nowcast and forecast experiments. Results are reported which illustrate how non-Gaussian information originates, and how it can be used to characterize ecosystem properties. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

11,The long-range transport of birch (Betula) pollen from Poland and Germany causes significant pre-season concentrations in Denmark,"Birch pollen is highly allergic and has the potential for episodically long-range transport. Such episodes will in general occur out of the main pollen season. During this time, allergy patients are unprotected and high pollen concentrations will therefore have a full allergenic impact. To show that Denmark obtains significant quantities of birch pollen from Poland or Germany before the local trees start to flower. Simultaneous observations of pollen concentrations and phenology in the potential source area in Poland as well as in Denmark were performed in 2006. The Danish pollen records from 2000 to 2006 were analysed for possible long-range transport episodes and analysed with trajectories in combination with a birch tree source map. In 2006, high pollen concentrations were observed in Denmark with bi-hourly concentrations above 500 grains/m(3) before the local trees began to flower. Poland was identified as a source region. The analysis of the historical pollen record from Copenhagen shows significant pre-seasonal pollen episodes almost every year from 2000 to 2006. In all episodes, trajectory analysis identified Germany or Poland as source regions. Denmark obtains significant pre-seasonal quantities of birch pollen from either Poland or Germany almost every year. Forecasting of birch pollen quantities relevant to allergy patients must therefore, take into account long-range transport. This cannot be based on measured concentrations in Denmark. The most effective way to improve the current Danish pollen forecasts is to extend the current forecasts with atmospheric transport models that take into account pollen emission and transport from countries such as Germany and Poland. Unless long-range transport is taken into account, pre-seasonal pollen episodes will have a full allergic impact, as the allergy patients in general will be unprotected during that time.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02771.x,"Skjoth, CA; Sommer, J; Stach, A; Smith, M; Brandt, J",2007,Article,Clin.

The data comes from the PALINOCAM network and the samplers used were Hirst type (Burkard pollen trap). Platanus pollen is present in the atmosphere during a short period of time in spring, and the maximum concentrations are detected during the last two weeks of March and the first week of April. Regression analysis shows that the pollen concentration of the two previous days is the best predictive variable. The models obtained for the four stations analysed account for between 37 and 61% of the variation in pollen levels in the air.

We obtained an r-squared of 51% with both the seasonal and time-lagged coefficients which was statistically significant. Although the catch has decreased substantially in the last ten years, no long-term trend is evident. This model can be used for short-term and possibly medium-term fish catch forecasting. The catch in the Songkhla Lake basin may have exceeded the sustainable capacity due to over-exploitation and illegal fishing.

179,Forecasting and explanation of algal dynamics in two shallow lakes by recurrent artificial neural network and hybrid evolutionary algorithm,Long-term time-series of the two eutrophic Dutch lakes Veluwemeer and Wolderwijd were subject to predictive modelling by recurrent supervised ANN (RANN) and hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA). A combination of bottom-up and top-down eutrophication control measures has been implemented in both lakes since 1979. Dividing the time-series data into training and validation datasets based on three distinctive management periods has facilitated a comparative analysis of the two lakes regarding the long-term dynamics in response to eutrophication control. Results of the study have demonstrated that RANN and HEA can be applied for (1) 5-day-ahead prediction of Oscillatoria spp. and (2) 5-day-ahead prediction of Scenedesmus spp. Firstly RANN achieved reasonably accurate results for 5-day-ahead forecasting of abundances of blue-green algae Oscillatoria and green algae Scenedesmus in both lakes. Secondly HEA achieved similar good forecasting results and also provided model representations for both algae species in the form of rule sets. The limitation with single lake models is that the rule sets discovered are lake specific. Merging of the two lake datasets using merged lake models for both training and testing have produced simpler and generic rule sets that explain the dynamics of Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus for both lakes. The results from this study have shown that both external nutrient control combined with food web manipulation have turned the lakes from hypereutrophic conditions and from Oscillatoria to Scenedesmus dominance. These complex dynamics that are associated with the shift from periods of turbid with Oscillatoria dominance to clear-water conditions with increased Scenedesmus in both lakes are predictable and can be explained by the key-driving variables in the generic rule sets discovered.

89,An Epidemiological Model for Externally Sourced Vector-Borne Viruses Applied to Bean yellow mosaic virus in Lupin Crops in a Mediterranean-Type Environment,"A hybrid mechanistic/statistical model was developed to predict vector activity and epidemics of vector-borne viruses spreading from external virus sources to an adjacent crop. The pathosystem tested was Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) spreading from annually self-regenerating, le,legume-based pastures to adjacent crops of narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) in the winter-spring growing season in a region with a Mediterranean-type environment where the virus persists over summer within dormant seed of annual clovers. The model uses a combination of daily rainfall and mean temperature during late Summer and early fall to drive aphid population increase, migration of aphids from pasture to lupin crops, and the spread of BYMV. The model predicted time of arrival of aphid vectors and resulting BYMV spread successfully for seven of eight datasets from 2 years of field observations at four sites representing different rainfall and geographic zones of the southwestern Australian grainbelt. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of the main parameters that describe the pathosystem. The hybrid mechanistic/statistical approach used created a flexible analytical tool for vector-mediated plant pathosystems that made useful predictions even when field data were not available for some components of the system.",https://doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-12-1280,"Maling, T; Diggle, AJ; Thaccray, DJ; Siddique, KHM; Jones, RAC",2008,Article,Phytopathology,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,modelling,NA
347,Chaos in a long-term experiment with a plankton community,"Mathematical models predict that species interactions such as competition and predation can generate chaos(1-8). However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations(9-12). Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long- term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15 - 30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long- term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.",https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06512,"Beninca, E; Huisman, J; Heerkloss, R; Johnk, KD; Branco, P; Van Nes, EH; Scheffer, M; Ellner, SP",2008,Article,Nature,English,rachel corrigan,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
378,Data Mining for Environmental Analysis and Diagnostic: A case study of upwelling ecosystem of Arraial do Caboc,"The Brazilian coastal zone presents a large extension and a variety of environments. Nevertheless, little is known about biological diversity and ecosystem dynamics. Environmental changes always occur; however, it is important to distinguish natural from anthropic variability.

209,A management framework for preventing the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species,"Biological invasions continue to accelerate, and there is a need for closer integration between invasive species research and on-the-ground management. In many regions, aquatic invasive species have established isolated populations, but have not yet spread to many sites that provide suitable habitat. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, several Great Lakes invaders such as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) are currently undergoing secondary spread to the smaller inland lakes and streams. This paper describes recent advances in forecasting the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species and presents a framework for assessing vulnerability of inland waters based on explicit assessment of three distinct aspects of biological invasions: colonization, site suitability, and adverse impact. In many cases, only a fraction of lakes on the landscape are vulnerable to specific invasive species, highlighting the potential application of this type of research for improving invasive species management. Effective application to on-the-ground resource management will require that research aimed at assessing site vulnerability be translated into management tools.",https://doi.org/10.1139/F08-099,"Vander Zanden, MJ; Olden, JD",2008,Article,Can.

16,CHLfuzzy: a spreadsheet tool for the fuzzy modeling of chlorophyll concentrations in coastal lagoons,"CHLFuzzy is a user-friendly, flexible, multiple-input single-output Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rule based model developed in a MS-Excel (R) spreadsheet environment. The model receives a raw dataset consisting of four predictor variables, e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration, and solar radiation levels. It then defines fuzzy sets according to a collection of fuzzy membership functions, allowing for the establishment of fuzzy 'if-then' rules, and predicts chlorophyll-a concentrations, which highly compare to the measured ones. The performance of the model was tested against the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), showing satisfactory results. An extensive dataset of environmental observations in Vassova Lagoon (Northern Greece), during the years 2001-2002, was used to train the model and an independent dataset collected during 2004 was used to validate CHLFuzzy and ANFIS models. Although both models showed a similar performance on the training dataset, with quite satisfactory agreement between observed and modeled chlorophyll-a values, the best results were obtained using the CHLfuzzy model. Similarly, the CHLfuzzy model depicted a fairly good ability to hindcast chlorophyll-a concentrations for the verification dataset, thus improving ANFIS model forecasts. Overall results suggest that CHLfuzzy can potentially be used as a lagoon water quality forecasting tool requiring limited computational cost.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9358-4,"Sylaios, GK; Gitsakis, N; Koutroumanidis, T; Tsihrintzis, VA",2008,Article,Hydrobiologia,English,abby lewis,modeling; not forecasting,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA

418,A deterministic formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter: an alternative to ensemble square root filters,"The use of perturbed observations in the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) results in a suboptimal filter behaviour, particularly for small ensembles. In this work, we propose a simple modification to the traditional EnKF that results in matching the analysed error covariance given by Kalman filter in cases when the correction is small; without perturbed observations. The proposed filter is based on the recognition that in the case of small corrections to the forecast the traditional EnKF without perturbed observations reduces the forecast error covariance by an amount that is nearly twice as large as that is needed to match Kalman filter. The analysis scheme works as follows: update the ensemble mean and the ensemble anomalies separately; update the mean using the standard analysis equation; update the anomalies with the same equation but half the Kalman gain. The proposed filter is shown to be a linear approximation to the ensemble square root filter (ESRF). Because of its deterministic character and its similarity to the traditional EnKF we call it the 'deterministic EnKF', or the DEnKF. A number of numerical experiments to compare the performance of the DEnKF with both the EnKF and an ESRF using three small models are conducted. We show that the DEnKF performs almost as well as the ESRF and is a significant improvement over the EnKF. Therefore, the DEnKF combines the numerical effectiveness, simplicity and versatility of the EnKF with the performance of the ESRFs. Importantly, the DEnKF readily permits the use of the traditional Schur product-based localization schemes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0870.2007.00299.x,"Sakov, P; Oke, PR",2008,Article; Proceedings Paper,Tellus Ser.

90,The impact of nudging in the meteorological model for retrospective air quality simulations. Part I: Evaluation against national observation networks,"It is common practice to use Newtonian relaxation, or nudging, throughout meteorological model simulations to create ""dynamic analyses"" that provide the characterization of the meteorological conditions for retrospective air quality model simulations. Given the impact that meteorological conditions have on air quality simulations, it has been assumed that the resultant air quality simulations would be more skillful by using dynamic analyses rather than meteorological forecasts to characterize the meteorological conditions, and that the statistical trends in the meteorological model fields are also reflected in the air quality model. This article, which is the first of two parts, demonstrates the impact of nudging in the meteorological model on retrospective air quality model simulations. Here, meteorological simulations are generated by the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) using both the traditional dynamic analysis approach and using forecasts for a summertime period. The resultant fields are then used to characterize the meteorological conditions for emissions processing and air quality simulations using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modeling System. As expected, on average, the near-surface meteorological fields show a significant degradation over time in the forecasts ( when nudging is not used), while the dynamic analyses maintain nearly constant statistical scores in time. The use of nudged MM5 fields in CMAQ generally results in better skill scores for daily maximum 1-h ozone mixing ratio simulations. On average, the skill of the daily maximum 1-h ozone simulation deteriorates significantly over time when nonnudged MM5 fields are used in CMAQ. The daily maximum 1-h ozone mixing ratio also degrades over time in the CMAQ simulation that uses MM5 dynamic analyses, although to a much lesser degree, despite no aggregate loss of skill over time in the dynamic analyses themselves. These results affirm the advantage of using nudging in MM5 to create the meteorological characterization for CMAQ for retrospective simulations, and it is shown that MM5-based dynamic analyses are robust at the surface throughout 5.5-day simulations.",https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JAMC1790.1,"Otte, TL",2008,Article,J.

This results in filters suitable for non-linear problems whose solutions exhibit moving coherent features, such as thin interfaces in wildfire modelling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common state with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a residual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only gridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified by the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of the registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses intermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the states.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0870.2007.00275.x,"Beezley, JD; Mandel, J",2008,Article,Tellus Ser.

231,An ANN application for water quality forecasting,"Rapid urban and coastal developments often witness deterioration of regional seawater quality. As part of the management process, it is important to assess the baseline characteristics of the marine environment so that sustainable development can be pursued. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict and forecast quantitative characteristics of water bodies. The true power and advantage of this method lie in its ability to (1) represent both linear and non-linear relationships and (2) learn these relationships directly from the data being modeled. The study focuses on Singapore coastal waters. The ANN model is built for quick assessment and forecasting of selected water quality variables at any location in the domain of interest. Respective variables measured at other locations serve as the input parameters. The variables of interest are salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a. A time lag up to 2 Delta t appeared to suffice to yield good simulation results. To validate the performance of the trained ANN, it was applied to an unseen data set from a station in the region. The results show the ANN's great potential to simulate water quality variables. Simulation accuracy, measured in the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (R-2), ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 for the training and overfitting test data. Thus, a trained ANN model may potentially provide simulated values for desired locations at which measured data are unavailable yet required for water quality models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

163,The Bluelink ocean data assimilation system (BODAS),"Bluelink is Australia's contribution to the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE). The goals of GODAE include the development and application of eddy-resolving, data assimilating ocean forecast systems. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the Bluelink effort that are motivated by this goal. One of the main innovations of Bluelink is the development of the Bluelink ocean data assimilation system (BODAS). The initial test-bed for BODAS is the Bluelink ReANalysis (BRAN), a multi-year model integration with data assimilation. The Bluelink model is a global ocean general circulation model that is eddy-resolving in the Australian region. Observations that are assimilated into BRAN include satellite altimetry, sea-surface temperature and in situ temperature and salinity data from Argo, XBT, TAO and other sources. BODAS is an ensemble optimal interpolation system that uses an ensemble of intraseasonal anomalies from a free running model to estimate the background error covariances (BECs). The ensemble-based BECs are multivariate and inhomogeneous and are shown to reflect the length-scales, the anisotropy and the covariability of mesoscale oceanic processes. We evaluate the performance. of BODAS and BRAN (version 1.5), spanning the period January 2003 to June 2006, by comparing reanalyzed fields to a range of satellite-derived and in situ observations. Specifically, we demonstrate that BRAN realistically reproduces the mesoscale circulation around Australia, representing both the broad-scale circulation and, in many instances, the relatively small-scale mesoscale features. Quantitatively, we show that reanalyzed fields in the region around Australia are typically within 6-12 cm of withheld altimetric observations, within 0.5-0.9 degrees of observed sea-surface temperature and within 4-7 cm of observed coastal sea-level. Comparisons with Argo profiles and surface drifting buoys show that BRAN fields are within 1 degrees of observed sub-surface temperature, within 0.15 psu of observed sub-surface salinity and within 0.2 m s(-1) of near-surface currents. We identify initialisation as a key area in which the Bluelink system could be improved. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

131,Use an Improved BP Network to Simulate Lake Eutrophication,"Along with its rapid economy expanding, China is also facing the increasingly serious problem of cultural eutrophication. As part of the eutrophication research activities, applications of mathematical models are also widely used in China. In recent years' researches, there is a growing tendency to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to complement or even replace empirical models, among which BP networks are the most popular ones. However, these works still have some limitations in topology design of their networks, it is because the networks' topology fails to embody important characteristics of aquatic ecosystem that the effectiveness of their models seems remain to be improved. In this paper, with a study on eutrophication of Shenzhen Reservoir, we apply a BP network to simulate and forecast a lake aquatic ecosystem. The simulation result demonstrates the satisfying performance of BP networks in eutrophication modeling. Meanwhile, comparing three kinds of network topology with each other, this paper further proves that, by way of dividing factors into press and response ones to define inputs and outputs respectively and building up feedback routs between inputs and outputs, the performance of BP networks to simulate eutrophication could be improved effectively. Moreover, the trained network is also used to optimize countermeasure combination, with the aim to control eutrophication of Shenzhen Reservoir effectively and economically.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.919,"Chen, YF",2008,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
80,Claims of Potential Expansion throughout the U.S. by Invasive Python Species Are Contradicted by Ecological Niche Models,"Background: Recent reports from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) suggested that invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades may quickly spread into many parts of the U. S. due to putative climatic suitability. Additionally, projected trends of global warming were predicted to significantly increase suitable habitat and promote range expansion by these snakes. However, the ecological limitations of the Burmese python are not known and the possible effects of global warming on the potential expansion of the species are also unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that a predicted continental expansion is unlikely based on the ecology of the organism and the climate of the U. S. Our ecological niche models, which include variables representing climatic extremes as well as averages, indicate that the only suitable habitat in the U. S. for Burmese pythons presently occurs in southern Florida and in extreme southern Texas. Models based on the current distribution of the snake predict suitable habitat in essentially the only region in which the snakes are found in the U. S. Future climate models based on global warming forecasts actually indicate a significant contraction in suitable habitat for Burmese pythons in the U. S. as well as in their native range. Conclusions/Significance: The Burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the United States it currently inhabits due to the ecological niche preferences of the snake. The ability of the Burmese python to expand further into the U. S. is severely limited by ecological constraints. Global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide, underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002931,"Pyron, RA; Burbrink, FT; Guiher, TJ",2008,Article,PLoS One,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
112,Climate change hastens the turnover of stream fish assemblages,"Stream fish are expected to be significantly influenced by climate change, as they are ectothermic animals whose dispersal is limited within hydrographic networks. Nonetheless, they are also controlled by other physical factors that may prevent them moving to new thermally suitable sites. Using presence-absence records in 655 sites widespread throughout nine French river units, we predicted the potential future distribution of 30 common stream fish species facing temperature warming and change in precipitation regime. We also assessed the potential impacts on fish assemblages' structure and diversity. Only cold-water species, whose diversity is very low in French streams, were predicted to experience a strong reduction in the number of suitable sites. In contrast, most cool-water and warm-water fish species were projected to colonize many newly suitable sites. Considering that cold headwater streams are the most numerous on the Earth's surface, our results suggested that headwater species would undergo a deleterious effect of climate change, whereas downstream species would expand their range by migrating to sites located in intermediate streams or upstream. As a result, local species richness was forecasted to increase greatly and high turnover rates indicated future fundamental changes in assemblages' structure. Changes in assemblage composition were also positively related to the intensity of warming. Overall, these results (1) stressed the importance of accounting for both climatic and topographic factors when assessing the future distribution of riverine fish species and (2) may be viewed as a first estimation of climate change impacts on European freshwater fish assemblages.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01657.x,"Buisson, L; Thuiller, W; Lek, S; Lim, P; Grenouillet, G",2008,Article,Glob.

268,"BYDV PREDICTOR: a simulation model to predict aphid arrival, epidemics of Barley yellow dwarf virus and yield losses in wheat crops in a Mediterranean-type environment","BYDV PREDICTOR, a simulation model, was developed to forecast aphid outbreaks and Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) epidemics in wheat crops in the grainbelt region of southwest Australia, which has a Mediterranean-type climate. The model used daily rainfall and mean temperature to predict aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) buildup in each locality before the commencement of the cereal-growing season in late autumn, and to forecast the timing of aphid immigration into crops. The introduction of BYDV by aphid immigrants, aphid buildup within the crop, spread of BYDV, and yield losses were predicted for different sowing dates. The model simulations were validated with 10 years' field data from five different sites in the grainbelt, representing a wide range of scenarios. When first aphid arrival dates ranging from 1 June to 2 September were compared with predictions, 65% of the variation between sites and years was explained. Progress curves for the predicted percentage of plants infected with the serotype BYDV-PAV closely resembled the starting point and shape of those recorded in 14 out of 18 scenarios. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the combination of a high proportion of immigrants vectoring BYDV, early sowing of crops and early start to aphid arrival relative to sowing date led to the most BYDV spread and greatest yield loss. The model was incorporated into a decision support system used by farmers in targeting sprays against aphids to prevent virus spread in autumn and winter. BYDV PREDICTOR could serve as a template for modelling similar virus/aphid vector pathosystems in other regions of the world, especially those with Mediterranean-type climates.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01950.x,"Thackray, DJ; Diggle, AJ; Jones, RAC",2009,Article,Plant Pathol.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,"seems to use future weather in ""forecast""",NA

The human activities in areas surrounding enclosed and semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea always produce in the long term a strong environmental impact in the form of coastal and marine degradation. The presence of dissolved oxygen is essential for the survival of most organisms in the water bodies. This paper is concerned with the use of ANNs - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function neural networks for predicting the next fortnight's dissolved oxygen concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea water along Gaza. MLP and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks are trained and developed with reference to five important oceanographic variables including water temperature, wind velocity, turbidity, pH and conductivity. These variables are considered as inputs of the network. The data sets used in this study consist of four years and collected from nine locations along Gaza coast. The network performance has been tested with different data sets and the results show satisfactory performance. Prediction results prove that neural network approach has good adaptability and extensive applicability for modelling the dissolved oxygen in the Mediterranean Sea along Gaza.

The development of eutrophication models is important for the understanding of algal dynamics, water-quality forecasting, and environmental management. In the recent past, data-driven modeling techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have been increasingly used to model phytoplankton dynamics. Three ANN architectures were used to model the eutrophication processes in Singapore coastal waters using continuous weekly measurements of water-quality parameters. The trained ANN model is employed to predict the algal biomass at time (t) with different lag times for 15 water-quality parameters, including Chlorophyll-a. Even though there are unknown factors of seawater quality variation and the data are limited, a relatively good correlation was observed between the measured and predicted values.

461,Skill assessment for an operational algal bloom forecast system,"An operational forecast system for harmful algal blooms (HABs) in southwest Florida is analyzed for forecasting skill. The HABs, caused by the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, lead to shellfish toxicity and to respiratory irritation. In addition to predicting new blooms and their extent, HAB forecasts are made twice weekly during a bloom event, using a combination of satellite derived image products, wind predictions, and a rule-based model derived from previous observations and research. These forecasts include: identification, intensification, transport, extent, and impact; the latter being the most significant to the public. Identification involves identifying new blooms as HABs and is validated against an operational monitoring program involving water sampling. Intensification forecasts, which are much less frequently made, can only be evaluated with satellite data on mono-specific blooms. Extent and transport forecasts of HABs are also evaluated against the water samples. Due to the resolution of the forecasts and available validation data, skill cannot be resolved at scales finer than 30 km. Initially, respiratory irritation forecasts were analyzed using anecdotal information, the only available data, which had a bias toward major respiratory events leading to a forecast accuracy exceeding 90%. When a systematic program of twice-daily observations from lifeguards was implemented, the forecast could be meaningfully assessed. The results show that the forecasts identify the occurrence of respiratory events at all lifeguard beaches 70% of the time. However, a high rate (80%) of false positive forecasts occurred at any given beach. As the forecasts were made at half to whole county level, the resolution of the validation data was reduced to county level, reducing false positives to 22% (accuracy of 78%). The study indicates the importance of systematic sampling, even when using qualitative descriptors, the use of validation resolution to evaluate forecast capabilities, and the need to match forecast and validation resolutions.

182,Forecasting tree mortality using change metrics derived from MODIS satellite data,"Insect-induced tree mortality can cause substantial timber and carbon losses in many regions of the world. There is a critical need to forecast tree mortality to guide forest management decisions. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery provides inexpensive and frequent coverage over large areas, facilitating forest health monitoring. This study examined time series of MODIS satellite images to forecast tree mortality for a Pinus radiata plantation in southern New South Wales, Australia. Dead tree density derived from ADS40 aerial imagery was used to evaluate the performance of change metrics derived from time series of MODIS-based vegetation indices. Continuous subset selection by LASSO regression and model assessment using a variant of the bootstrap were used to select the best performing change metrics out of a large amount of predictor variables to account for over-fitting. The results suggest that 250 m 16-daily MODIS images are effective for forecasting tree mortality. Seasonal change metrics derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) outperformed the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). Temporal analysis illustrated that optimal forecasting power was obtained using change metrics based on three years of satellite data for this population. The forecast could be used to optimise the scheduling of detailed forest health surveys and silvicultural operations which currently are planned based on stratified, annual assessments. This coarse-scale, spatio-temporal analysis represents a potentially cost-effective early warning approach to forecasting tree mortality in pine plantations by identifying compartments that require more detailed investigation.

438,A Predictive Framework to Understand Forest Responses to Global Change,"Forests are one of Earth's critical biomes. They have been shown to respond strongly to many of the drivers that are predicted to change natural systems over this century, including climate, introduced species, and other anthropogenic influences. Predicting how different tree species might respond to this complex of forces remains a daunting challenge for forest ecologists. Yet shifts in species composition and abundance can radically influence hydrological and atmospheric systems, plant and animal ranges, and human populations, making this challenge an important one to address. Forest ecologists have gathered a great deal of data over the past decades and are now using novel quantitative and computational tools to translate those data into predictions about the fate of forests. Here, after a brief review of the threats to forests over the next century, one of the more promising approaches to making ecological predictions is described: using hierarchical Bayesian methods to model forest demography and simulating future forests from those models. This approach captures complex processes, such as seed dispersal and mortality, and incorporates uncertainty due to unknown mechanisms, data problems, and parameter uncertainty. After describing the approach, an example by simulating drought for a southeastern forest is offered.

Each model, based oil a conceptual model, was applied to a 41-year time series of recruitment, spawner biomass. and environmental covariates. A Subset of the available time series, all in-sample data set consisting of 35 of the 41 data points, was used to fit an environment-dependent recruitment model. Influential covariates were identified through statistical variable selection methods to build the best explanatory recruitment model. Ail out-of-sample set of six data points was retained for model Validation. We tested tell model's ability to forecast recruitment by applying them to an out-of-sample data set. For a more robust evaluation of forecast accuracy. models were tested with Monte Carlo resampling trials. The ANNs outperformed the other techniques during file model fitting process. For forecasting, the ANNs were not statistically different front MLRs or GAMs. The results indicated that more complex models lend to lie more susceptible to an overparameterization problem.

446,Synchrony of Marine Fish Catches and Climate and Ocean Regime Shifts in the North Pacific Ocean,"Catches of 19 marine fish species from the eastern and western portions of the North Pacific Ocean during 1970-2004 were examined to determine whether there was synchrony in their responses to the generally accepted climate regime shifts that occurred during that period. Catches for these species represented approximately 55% of the total fish catch in the North Pacific in the 1990s. Five distinct groups were apparent in the data, and each group exhibited a different response to the climate regime shifts of 1977, 1989, and 1998. Some species appeared to have responded only to the regime shift in 1977, others responded only to the shift in 1989, and a few species responded to both. The trends in the time series of catches for these five groups were not random, and shifts in catch generally coincided with regime shifts as identified by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and other indices of climate change. Although this study examined the relationship of fisheries to trends in climate, there is an obvious linkage to the population dynamics of a particular species. Understanding how climate affects these linkages may help improve our ability to reliably forecast population and fishery trends in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1577/C08-001.1,"Noakes, DJ; Beamish, RJ",2009,Article,Mar.

83,FUZZY INDICES OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS: REVIEW OF TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS,"The impact of human activities on natural ecosystems is becoming more and more severe, with consequences that are difficult to forecast for middle-term and long-term periods. Hence, routine monitoring and quality assessment is a necessary practice for effective environmental management. However, the definition of techniques and criteria for monitoring is not a trivial task: identification of new indices of environmental quality is a hot research topic in the field of applied ecology. Some critical issues of ecological quality assessment are represented by the different sources of uncertainty involved in the measurement, modelling and classification processes. Measurements of environmental variables are often imprecise due to natural variability and background noise; interactions between single variables are complex, as is the behaviour of natural ecosystems. Moreover, the translation of quantitative measurements into quality classes requires a subjective classification: the definition of threshold values of acceptability depends on the personal knowledge of the scientist who designs the model. The management of all of these potential sources of uncertainty requires suitable instruments. Fuzzy logic represents an effective technique for coping with such problems, as it allows the use of information that other methods cannot include, such as individual knowledge and experience, to combine quantitative and qualitative data in modeling ecological complexity. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical formalism that translates expert judgment expressed in linguistic terms into precise numbers, so the laws of fuzziness are scientifically sound; at the same time, it allows avoidance of artificial precision and producing results that are more similar to the real world. For all of these reasons, since the middle 1990s fuzzy indices of ecological conditions have been proposed and tested in air, water and soil environments. Fuzzy techniques have been applied at different stages of the assessment process, as the coding of species' biological traits, the processing of qualitative data, the definition of ecological rules, and the multicriteria evaluation of ecosystems. The objective of this chapter is to review the most relevant fuzzy techniques applied to the ecological quality assessment, providing a rational classification of such techniques, in order to allow a qualitative comparison of the considered approaches. Moreover, this chapter aims to highlight the most promising applications of fuzzy logic to ecological research in order to show the benefits of fuzzy-based approaches when coping with the high complexity of ecosystems.",NA,"Marchini, A",2009,Article; Book Chapter,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
26,Forecasting the start of Quercus pollen season using several methods - the evaluation of their efficiency,"Forecasting the time when the atmospheric pollen season of allergenic plants begins is particularly important for doctors and their patients. The aim of this paper is to determine whether it is possible to forecast the start of the oak (Quercus) pollen season in Rzeszw, Poland. In the elaboration of the most effective model, various forecasting techniques were tested: growth degree days (GDDA degrees C); meteorological factors; bioclimatic factors; and indicator taxon. The aerobiological monitoring was carried out in 1997-2005 and 2007 in Rzeszw (SE Poland). In the presented investigation, three methods defining the start of the Quercus pollen season were selected on the basis of accumulated sums of pollen or the constant occurrence of pollen grains in air. Despite the application of different combinations of GDDA degrees C methods and threshold temperatures, the correlation coefficients between the expected and obtained values were low. In some cases, however, they proved highly effective for the test years (2005, 2007) with the accuracy of a few days. For GDDA degrees C methods, the best threshold temperatures range between 5 and 6A degrees C. Models based on bioclimatic indices and meteorological variables were not satisfactory. On the basic of the 10 years of results, the method of indicator species were good for forecast the start of oak pollen season.

14,Frequentist model averaging estimation: a review,"In applications, the traditional estimation procedure generally begins with model selection. Once a specific model is selected, subsequent estimation is conducted under the selected model without consideration of the uncertainty from the selection process. This often leads to the underreporting of variability and too optimistic confidence sets. Model averaging estimation is an alternative to this procedure, which incorporates model uncertainty into the estimation process. In recent years, there has been a rising interest in model averaging from the frequentist perspective, and some important progresses have been made. In this paper, the theory and methods on frequentist model averaging estimation are surveyed.

221,Predicting average regional yield and production of wheat in the Argentine Pampas by an artificial neural network approach,"A regional analysis of the effects of soil and climate factors on wheat yield was performed in the Argentine Pampas in order to obtain models suitable for yield estimation and regional grain production prediction. Soil data from soil surveys and climate data from meteorological records were employed. Grain production information from statistics at county level was integrated at a geomorphological level. The Pampas was divided into 10 geographical units and data from 10 growing season were used (1995-2004). Surface regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) methodologies were tested for analyzing the data. Wheat yield was correlated to soil available water holding capacity (SAWHC) in the upper 100 cm of the profiles (r(2) = 0.39) and soil organic carbon (SOC) content (r(2) = 0.26). The climate factor with stronger effect on yield was the rainfall/crop potential evapotranspiration ratio (R/CPET) during the fallow and vegetative crop growing cycle periods summed (r(2) = 0.31). The phototermal quotient (PQ) during the pre-anthesis period had also a significant effect on yield (r(2) = 0.05). A surface regression response model was developed that account for 64% of spatial and interannual yield variance, but this model could not perform a better yield prediction than the blind guess technique. An ANN was fitted to the data that accounted for 76% of yield variability. Comparing predicted versus observed yield a lower RMSE (P = 0.05) was obtained using the ANN than using the regression or the blind guess methods. Regional production estimations performed by the ANN showed a good agreement with observed data with a RMSE equivalent to 7% of the whole surveyed area production. As variables used for the ANN development may be available around 40-60 days before wheat harvest, the methodology may be used for wheat production forecasting in the Pampas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

111,Severe Winter Freezes Enhance St. Louis Encephalitis Virus Amplification and Epidemic Transmission in Peninsular Florida,"Mosquito-borne arboviral epidemics tend to strike without warning. The driving force for these epidemics is a combination of biotic (vector, amplification host, and virus) and abiotic (meteorological conditions, especially rainfall and temperature) factors. Abiotic factors that facilitate the synchronization and interaction of vector and amplification host populations favor epidemic amplification and transmission. In Florida, epidemics of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, SLEV) have been preceded by major freezes one or two winters before the onset of human cases. Here, we analyze the relationship between severe winter freezes and epidemic SLEV transmission in peninsular Florida and show that there is a significant relationship between the transmission of SLEV and these severe freezes. We propose that by killing cold-sensitive understory vegetation in the mid-peninsular region of Florida, freezes enhance the reproductive success of ground-feeding avian amplification hosts, especially mourning doves and common grackles. In conjunction with other appropriate environmental signals, increased avian reproductive success may enhance SLEV and West Nile (WN) virus amplification and result in SLE and WN epidemics during years when all of the biological cycles are properly synchronized. The knowledge that winter freezes in Florida may enhance the amplification and epidemic transmission of SLE and WN viruses facilitates arboviral tracking and prediction of human risk of SLE and WN infection during the transmission season.",https://doi.org/10.1603/033.046.0638,"Day, JF; Shaman, J",2009,Article,J.

469,MIGCLIM: Predicting plant distribution and dispersal in a changing climate,"Aim Many studies have forecasted the possible impact of climate change on plant distributions using models based on ecological niche theory, but most of them have ignored dispersal-limitations, assuming dispersal to be either unlimited or null. Depending on the rate of climatic change, the landscape fragmentation and the dispersal capabilities of individual species, these assumptions are likely to prove inaccurate, leading to under-or overestimation of future species distributions and yielding large uncertainty between these two extremes. As a result, the concepts of 'potentially suitable' and 'potentially colonizable' habitat are expected to differ significantly. To quantify to what extent these two concepts can differ, we developed MIGCLIM, a model simulating plant dispersal under climate change and landscape fragmentation scenarios. MIGCLIM implements various parameters, such as dispersal distance, increase in reproductive potential over time, landscape fragmentation or long-distance dispersal. Location Western Swiss Alps. Methods Using our MIGCLIM model, several simulations were run for two virtual species by varying dispersal distance and other parameters. Each simulation covered the 100-year period 2001-2100 and three different IPCC-based temperature warming scenarios were considered. Results of dispersal-limited projections were compared with unlimited and no-dispersal projections. Results Our simulations indicate that: (1) using realistic parameter values, the future potential distributions generated using MIGCLIM can differ significantly (up to more than 95% difference in colonized surface) from those that ignore dispersal; (2) this divergence increases under more extreme climate warming scenarios and over longer time periods; and (3) the uncertainty associated with the warming scenario can be as large as the one related to dispersal parameters.

388,On the Weighting of Multimodel Ensembles in Seasonal and Short-Range Weather Forecasting,"The performance of multimodel ensemble forecasting depends on the weights given to the different models of the ensemble in the postprocessing of the direct model forecasts. This paper compares the following different weighting methods with or without taking into account the single-model performance: equal weighting of models (EW), simple skill-based weighting (SW), using a simple model performance indicator, and weighting by Bayesian model averaging ( BMA). These methods are tested for both short-range weather and seasonal temperature forecasts. The prototype seasonal multimodel ensemble is the Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble System for Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction (DEMETER) system, with four different models and nine forecasts per model. The short-range multimodel prototype system is the European Meteorological Services (EUMETNET) Poor-Man's Ensemble Prediction System (PEPS), with 14 models and one forecast per model. It is shown that despite the different forecast ranges and spatial scales, the impact of weighting is comparable for both forecast systems and is related to the same ensemble characteristics. In both cases the added value of ensemble forecasting over single-model forecasting increases considerably with the decreasing correlation of the models' forecast errors, with a relation depending only on the number of models. Also, in both cases a larger spread in model performance increases the added value of combining model forecasts using the performance-based SW or BMA weighting instead of EW. Finally, the more complex BMA weighting adds value over SW only if the best model performs better than the ensemble with EW weighting.",https://doi.org/10.1175/2009MWR2893.1,"Casanova, S; Ahrens, B",2009,Article,Mon.

383,Modelling spread of the invasive macrophyte Cabomba caroliniana,"1. Predicting spread of non-indigenous species requires an understanding of where propagules are being transported, and whether these propagules can survive in the novel habitat and successfully integrate into the recipient community. In this study, we model potential spread of invading Cabomba caroliniana in Ontario, Canada, using a combination of passive and active dispersal models coupled with an environmental suitability model, thereby considering the first two stages of the invasion process. 2. Measures of propagule pressure incorporated both human-mediated dispersal via trailered boats, and advective flow from invaded to non-invaded systems, while habitat suitability was forecasted by combining native and global data sets and using boosted regression trees. 3. Risk of invasion differed depending on the combination of approaches used and the time period considered. Three lakes appear to be at greatest risk owing to a combination of high boater and water movement from invaded sources, and high environmental suitability. The best predictors of lake suitability were pH, mean lake temperature and dissolved calcium concentration. Hundreds of lakes in Ontario may be suitable for establishment of Cabomba, highlighting the need for vector management.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02108.x,"Jacobs, MJ; Macisaac, HJ",2009,Article,Freshw.

97,Comparison of fuzzy inference systems for streamflow prediction,"A comparison of the Mamdani and the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy inference systems is presented for predicting streamflow values. The TS fuzzy rule base uses linear functions of inputs to predict the output, whereas the Mamdani version of inference determines outputs through fuzzy sub-sets. A genetic algorithm-trained Mamdani system is applied for streamflow forecasting. All the uncertainties and model complications are treated in linguistic expressions in the form of IF-THEN statements. Fuzzy membership functions, rules and the type of defuzzification method are adjusted until the best correlation between measured and predicted values is reached. The two methods are then applied to flow predictions on the Euphrates River in Turkey, without employing exogenous variables such as rainfall. The advantages and disadvantages of the models are discussed using the case study. It is shown that the Mamdani type of fuzzy inference modelling outperforms the Takagi-Sugeno approach in terms of error criteria comparisons, but neither of the two outperforms a standard ARMA(2, 2) model.",https://doi.org/10.1623/hysj.54.2.261,"Ozger, M",2009,Article,Hydrol.

53,Increases in air temperature can promote wind-driven dispersal and spread of plants,"Long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds and pollen shapes the spatial dynamics of plant genotypes, populations and communities. Quantifying LDD is thus important for predicting the future dynamics of plants exposed to environmental changes. However, environmental changes can also alter the behaviour of LDD vectors: for instance, increasing air temperature may enhance atmospheric instability, thereby altering the turbulent airflow that transports seed and pollen. Here, we investigate temperature effects on wind dispersal in a boreal forest using a 10-year time series of micrometeorological measurements and a Lagrangian stochastic model for particle transport. For a wide range of dispersal and life history types, we found positive relations between air temperature and LDD. This translates into a largely consistent positive effect of +3 degrees C warming on predicted LDD frequencies and spread rates of plants. Relative increases in LDD frequency tend to be higher for heavy-seeded plants, whereas absolute increases in LDD and spread rates are higher for light-seeded plants for which wind is often an important dispersal vector. While these predicted increases are not sufficient to compensate forecasted range losses and environmental changes can alter plant spread in various ways, our results generally suggest that warming can promote wind-driven movements of plant genotypes and populations in boreal forests.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.0693,"Kuparinen, A; Katul, G; Nathan, R; Schurr, FM",2009,Article,Proc.

71,Demographic models and IPCC climate projections predict the decline of an emperor penguin population,"Studies have reported important effects of recent climate change on Antarctic species, but there has been to our knowledge no attempt to explicitly link those results to forecasted population responses to climate change. Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) is projected to shrink as concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) increase, and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) are extremely sensitive to these changes because they use sea ice as a breeding, foraging and molting habitat. We project emperor penguin population responses to future sea ice changes, using a stochastic population model that combines a unique long-term demographic dataset (1962-2005) from a colony in Terre Adelie, Antarctica and projections of SIE from General Circulation Models (GCM) of Earth's climate included in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We show that the increased frequency of warm events associated with projected decreases in SIE will reduce the population viability. The probability of quasi-extinction (a decline of 95% or more) is at least 36% by 2100. The median population size is projected to decline from approximate to 6,000 to approximate to 400 breeding pairs over this period. To avoid extinction, emperor penguins will have to adapt, migrate or change the timing of their growth stages. However, given the future projected increases in GHGs and its effect on Antarctic climate, evolution or migration seem unlikely for such long lived species at the remote southern end of the Earth.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0806638106,"Jenouvrier, S; Caswell, H; Barbraud, C; Holland, M; Stroeve, J; Weimerskirch, H",2009,Article,Proc.

470,A Comparison of ANN Architecture towards Predicting Cyanobacteria Abundance at Tropical Lake and Wetlands,"Algal blooms are becoming increasingly prevalent and serious water quality issues worldwide. Algal bloom events at water resources can cause taste and odor problems, damage the environment, and some algal classes like Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) which release toxins in water may lead to serious diseases or cause fatalities to human. Thus there is a need to develop computational models that can accurately forecast algal bloom which in turns provides valuable lead time for lake and reservoir management to take the necessary correction or preventive actions. This research focused on the feasibility of using artificial neural network (ANN) technology as a modeling and forecasting tool for Cyanobacteria. It also presents a thorough study on the co-relationship of system accuracy with the deployment of different ANN architectures namely Generalized Feed-Forward (GFF), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Recurrent Artificial Neural network (RNN). Historical data collected from tropical Putrajaya Lake and Wetlands served as the test case and the system accuracy is measured in terms of its root means square error (RMSE). The results indicate that the RMSE values are within acceptable range of 105 to 120 (cell/ml) whereby the model developed using RBF architecture out performed slightly better than other models. The high predictive accuracy indicates that with sufficient data, both in terms of the number of historical algal bloom events and availability of important predictor data, ANNs can serve as reliable, forecasting tools.",https://doi.org/10.3850/978-981-08-5716-5_T266,"Oh, JH; Malek, S; Ahmad, SMS; Salleh, A",2010,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,1
420,A double-threshold temperature sum model for predicting the flowering duration and relative intensity of Betula pendula and B. pubescens,"The accurate prediction of the flowering period and the amount of released pollen of wind-pollinated trees is important for predicting the aerobiological pollen amounts and for estimating the intensity of background pollination of orchard seed production. Current phenological models, such as the commonly used temperature sum (thermal time) model, are efficient for predicting the timing of point events, e.g. the onset of flowering or leaf unfolding. However, the flowering period of boreal trees, including Betula pendula and B. pubescens, may last up to 5 weeks with widely varying flowering intensity. Therefore, the ability to predict the duration of the whole flowering period and the intensity of pollination is very important. In this paper, we present a new phenological model that predicts the whole flowering period and daily (normalized) variation of flowering intensity. The model is based on similar principles as the temperature sum model. The model was calibrated against pollen data recorded with pollen traps placed in several locations in Southern and Central Finland. Our new model predicted accurately the variation in the intensity throughout the flowering period. Moreover, it was able to predict the start and end of the pollination season with accuracy comparable to that achieved with an ordinary temperature sum model for point events. Due to limited amount of test data, the data-dependency of the model had to be tested with a bootstrapping approach. With this method, the model fit and parameter values showed to be independent of the parameter fitting data. The model can be used to predict the whole flowering period of wind-pollinated boreal trees for many different purposes, such as aerobiological forecasts of allergenic pollen, or generation of input data for models of long-range pollen transport.

412,"Forecasting daily pollen concentrations using data-driven modeling methods in Thessaloniki, Greece","Airborne pollen have been associated with allergic symptoms in sensitized individuals, having a direct impact on the overall quality of life of a considerable fraction of the population. Therefore, forecasting elevated airborne pollen concentrations and communicating this piece of information to the public are key issues in prophylaxis and safeguarding the quality of life of the overall population. In this study, we adopt a data-oriented approach in order to develop operational forecasting models (1-7 days ahead) of daily average airborne pollen concentrations of the highly allergenic taxa: Poaceae, Oleaceae and Urticaceae. The models are developed using a representative dataset consisting of pollen and meteorological time-series recorded during the years 1987-2002, in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The input variables (features) of the models have been optimized by making use of genetic algorithms, whereas we evaluate the performance of three algorithms: i) multi-Layer Perceptron, ii) support vector regression and iii) regression trees originating from distinct domains of Computational Intelligence (Cl), and compare the resulting models with traditional multiple linear regression models. Results show the superiority of Cl methods, especially when forecasting several days ahead, compared to traditional multiple linear regression models. Furthermore, the Cl models complement each other, resulting to a combined model that performs better than each one separately. The overall performance ranges, in terms of the index of agreement, from 0.85 to 0.93 clearly suggesting the potential operational use of the models. The latter ones can be utilized in provision of personalized and on-time information services, which can improve quality of life of sensitized citizens. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide a synthesis of climate change effects on native bark beetles, important mortality agents of conifers in western North America. Because of differences in temperature-dependent life-history strategies, including cold-induced mortality and developmental timing, responses to warming will differ among and within bark beetle species. The success of bark beetle populations will also be influenced indirectly by the effects of climate on community associates and host-tree vigor, although little information is available to quantify these relationships. We used available population models and climate forecasts to explore the responses of two eruptive bark beetle species. Based on projected warming, increases in thermal regimes conducive to population success are predicted for Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby) and Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, although there is considerable spatial and temporal variability. These predictions from population models suggest a movement of temperature suitability to higher latitudes and elevations and identify regions with a high potential for bark beetle outbreaks and associated tree mortality in the coming century.",https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2010.60.8.6,"Bentz, BJ; Regniere, J; Fettig, CJ; Hansen, EM; Hayes, JL; Hicke, JA; Kelsey, RG; Negron, JF; Seybold, SJ",2010,Article,Bioscience,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
334,Notes and Correspondence Accelerating the spin-up of Ensemble Kalman Filtering,"Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) may have a longer spin-up time to reach its asymptotic level of accuracy than the corresponding spin-up time in variational methods (3D-Var or 4D-Var). During the spin-up EnKF has to fulfill two independent requirements, namely that the ensemble mean be close to the true state, and that the ensemble perturbations represent the 'errors of the day'. As a result, there are cases, such as radar observations of a severe storm, or regional forecast of a hurricane, where EnKF may spin-up too slowly to be useful. A heuristic scheme is proposed to accelerate the spin-up of EnKF by applying a no-cost Ensemble Kalman Smoother, and using the observations more than once in each assimilation window during spin-up in order to maximize the initial extraction of information. The performance of this scheme is tested with the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) implemented in a quasi-geostrophic model, which requires a very long spin-up time when initialized from random initial perturbations from a uniform distribution. Results show that with the new 'running in place' (RIP) scheme the LETKF spins up and converges to the optimal level of error faster than 3D-Var or 4D-Var, even in the absence of any prior information. Additional computations (2 to 12 iterations for each assimilation window) are only required during the initial spin-up, since the scheme naturally returns to the original LETKF after spin-up is achieved. RIP also accelerates spin-up when the initial perturbations are drawn from a well-tuned 3D-Var background-error covariance, rather than being uniform noise, and fewer iterations and RIP cycles are required than in the case without such prior information.

410,An epidemiological model for externally acquired vector-borne viruses applied to Beet western yellows virus in Brassica napus crops in a Mediterranean-type environment,"A hybrid mechanistic/statistical model developed previously to predict vector activity and epidemics of vector-borne viruses was modified to simulate virus epidemics in the Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) - Brassica napus pathosystem. BWYV, which is persistently aphid-borne, spreads to B. napus crops from external sources and causes substantial yield losses when there is widespread infection of young plants. Risk that such losses may occur depends on the magnitude and availability of viral inoculum in the external source, the amount of biomass available to support aphid vectors, its duration before crop emergence, and the time of arrival of vector aphids in the crop. The model uses daily rainfall, temperature, and evaporation data from over 450 sites in the grainbelt of south-western Australia to track biomass levels throughout the growing season. This information is then used to simulate aphid vector populations and virus incidence, initially in the external source environment, then in the crop, and ultimately to provide risk forecasts.

184,A fuzzy-logic-based model to predict biogas and methane production rates in a pilot-scale mesophilic UASB reactor treating molasses wastewater,"A MIMO (multiple inputs and multiple outputs) fuzzy-logic-based model was developed to predict biogas and methane production rates in a pilot-scale 90-L mesophilic up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating molasses wastewater. Five input variables such as volumetric organic loading rate (OLR), volumetric total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal rate (R-V), influent alkalinity, influent pH and effluent pH were fuzzified by the use of an artificial intelligence-based approach. Trapezoidal membership functions with eight levels were conducted for the fuzzy subsets, and a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system was used to implement a total of 134 rules in the IF-THEN format. The product (prod) and the centre of gravity (COG, centroid) methods were employed as the inference operator and defuzzification methods, respectively. Fuzzy-logic predicted results were compared with the outputs of two exponential non-linear regression models derived in this study. The UASB reactor showed a remarkable performance on the treatment of molasses wastewater, with an average TCOD removal efficiency of 93 (+/-3)% and an average volumetric TCOD removal rate of 6.87 (+/-3.93) kg TCODremoved/m(3)-day, respectively. Findings of this study clearly indicated that, compared to non-linear regression models, the proposed MIMO fuzzy-logic-based model produced smaller deviations and exhibited a superior predictive performance on forecasting of both biogas and methane production rates with satisfactory determination coefficients over 0.98.

318,The Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP) for the CMAQ modeling system: updates through MCIPv3.4.1,"The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system, a state-of-the-science regional air quality modeling system developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, is being used for a variety of environmental modeling problems including regulatory applications, air quality forecasting, evaluation of emissions control strategies, process-level research, and interactions of global climate change and regional air quality. The Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP) is a vital piece of software within the CMAQ modeling system that serves to, as best as possible, maintain dynamic consistency between the meteorological model and the chemical transport model (CTM). MCIP acts as both a post-processor to the meteorological model and a pre-processor to the emissions and the CTM in the CMAQ modeling system. MCIP's functions are to ingest the meteorological model output fields in their native formats, perform horizontal and vertical coordinate transformations, diagnose additional atmospheric fields, define gridding parameters, and prepare the meteorological fields in a form required by the CMAQ modeling system. This paper provides an updated overview of MCIP, documenting the scientific changes that have been made since it was first released as part of the CMAQ modeling system in 1998.",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-3-243-2010,"Otte, TL; Pleim, JE",2010,Article,Geosci.

155,Ecological forecasting under climatic data uncertainty: a case study in phenological modeling,"Forecasting ecological responses to climate change represents a challenge to the ecological community because models are often site-specific and climate data are lacking at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions. We use a case study approach to demonstrate uncertainties in ecological predictions related to the driving climatic input data. We use observational records, derived observational datasets (e.g. interpolated observations from local weather stations and gridded data products) and output from general circulation models (GCM) in conjunction with site based phenology models to estimate the first flowering date (FFD) for three woody flowering species. Using derived observations over the modern time period, we find that cold biases and temperature trends lead to biased FFD simulations for all three species. Observational datasets resolved at the daily time step result in better FFD predictions compared to simulations using monthly resolution. Simulations using output from an ensemble of GCM and regional climate models over modern and future time periods have large intra-ensemble spreads and tend to underestimate observed FFD trends for the modern period. These results indicate that certain forcing datasets may be missing key features needed to generate accurate hindcasts at the local scale (e.g. trends, temporal resolution), and that standard modeling techniques (e.g. downscaling, ensemble mean, etc) may not necessarily improve the prediction of the ecological response. Studies attempting to simulate local ecological processes under modern and future climate forcing therefore need to quantify and propagate the climate data uncertainties in their simulations.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044014,"Cook, BI; Terando, A; Steiner, A",2010,Article,Environ.

40,Forecasting phenology under global warming,"As a consequence of warming temperatures around the world, spring and autumn phenologies have been shifting, with corresponding changes in the length of the growing season. Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953-2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast regional changes in phenology.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2010.0120,"Ibanez, I; Primack, RB; Miller-Rushing, AJ; Ellwood, E; Higuchi, H; Lee, SD; Kobori, H; Silander, JA",2010,Article,Philos.

230,A multi-modeling approach to evaluating climate and land use change impacts in a Great Lakes River Basin,"River ecosystems are driven by linked physical, chemical, and biological subsystems, which operate over different temporal and spatial domains. This complexity increases uncertainty in ecological forecasts, and impedes preparation for the ecological consequences of climate change. We describe a recently developed ""multi-modeling"" system for ecological forecasting in a 7600 km(2) watershed in the North American Great Lakes Basin. Using a series of linked land cover, climate, hydrologic, hydraulic, thermal, loading, and biological response models, we examined how changes in both land cover and climate may interact to shape the habitat suitability of river segments for common sport fishes and alter patterns of biological integrity. In scenario-based modeling, both climate and land use change altered multiple ecosystem properties. Because water temperature has a controlling influence on species distributions, sport fishes were overall more sensitive to climate change than to land cover change. However, community-based biological integrity metrics were more sensitive to land use change than climate change; as were nutrient export rates. We discuss the implications of this result for regional preparations for climate change adaptation, and the extent to which the result may be constrained by our modeling methodology.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0239-2,"Wiley, MJ; Hyndman, DW; Pijanowski, BC; Kendall, AD; Riseng, C; Rutherford, ES; Cheng, ST; Carlson, ML; Tyler, JA; Stevenson, RJ; Steen, PJ; Richards, PL; Seelbach, PW; Koches, JM; Rediske, RR",2010,Article,Hydrobiologia,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA

Several models were developed and 176 were selected based on their correlation values for the verification series. A time lag of 11 was used, equivalent to one sample (periods of 15 days in the summer and 30 days in the winter). Several combinations of the series were used. Input and output data collected from three depths of the reservoir were applied (surface, euphotic zone limit and bottom). The model that presented a higher average correlation value presented the correlations 0.991; 0.843; 0.978 for training, verification and test series. This model had the three series independent in time: first test series, then verification series and, finally, training series. Only six input variables were considered significant to the performance of this model: ammonia, phosphates, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH and water evaporation, physical and chemical parameters referring to the three depths of the reservoir. These variables are common to the next four best models produced and, although these included other input variables, their performance was not better than the selected best model.",https://doi.org/10.1039/c1em10127g,"Torres, R; Pereira, E; Vasconcelos, V; Teles, LO",2011,Article,J.

463,The potential use of a Gadget model to predict stock responses to climate change in combination with Bayesian networks: the case of Bay of Biscay anchovy,"The European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is a short-lived pelagic species distributed in Atlantic European waters, with the Bay of Biscay being one of the main centres of abundance. Because it is a short-lived species, the state of the stock is determined largely by incoming recruitment. Recruitment is highly variable and depends on a variety of factors, such as the size of the spawning stock and environmental conditions in the area. The use of a coupled model that could serve to predict the evolution of the anchovy stock in the short, medium, and long term under several fishing-pressure scenarios and given climate scenarios is demonstrated. This coupled model consists of a Gadget (Globally Applicable Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) model that was used to analyse the status of the Bay of Biscay anchovy population and to simulate future scenarios based on the estimated recruitment levels, combined with a probabilistic Bayesian network model for recruitment estimation based on machine-learning methods and using climatic indices as potential forecasting factors. The results indicate that certain combinations of medium to high fishing pressure and adverse environmental conditions could force the stock outside its biological reference boundaries.",https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsr087,"Andonegi, E; Fernandes, JA; Quincoces, I; Irigoien, X; Uriarte, A; Perez, A; Howel, D; Stefanssons, G",2011,Article,ICES J.

455,Predicting dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay: applications and implications,"Eutrophic depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) and its consequences for ecosystem dynamics have been a central theme of research, assessment and management policies for several decades in the Chesapeake Bay. Ongoing forecast efforts predict the extent of the summer hypoxic/anoxic area due to nutrient loads from the watershed. However, these models neither predict DO levels nor address the intricate interactions among various ecological processes. The prediction of spatially explicit DO levels in the Chesapeake Bay can eventually lead to a reliable depiction of the comprehensive ecological structure and functioning, and can also allow the quantification of the role of nutrient reduction strategies in water quality management. In this paper, we describe a three dimensional empirical model to predict DO levels in the Chesapeake Bay as a function of water temperature, salinity and dissolved nutrient concentrations (TDN and TDP). The residual analysis shows that predicted DO values compare well with observations. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) are used to evaluate the performance of the empirical model; the scores demonstrate the usability of model predictions (NSE, surface layer = 0.82-0.86; middle layer = 0.65-0.82; bottom layer = 0.70-0.82; RSR surface layer = 0.37-0.44; middle layer = 0.43-0.58 and bottom layer = 0.43-0.54). The predicted DO values and other physical outputs from downscaling of regional weather and climate predictions, or forecasts from hydrodynamic models, can be used to forecast various ecological components. Such forecasts would be useful for both recreational and commercial users of the Chesapeake Bay.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0191-x,"Prasad, MBK; Long, W; Zhang, XS; Wood, RJ; Murtugudde, R",2011,Article,Aquat.

We found that the Oceanic Nino Index was correlated with interannual fire activity in the eastern Amazon, whereas the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index was more closely linked with fires in the southern and southwestern Amazon. Combining these two climate indices, we developed an empirical model to forecast regional fire season severity with lead times of 3 to 5 months. Our approach may contribute to the development of an early warning system for anticipating the vulnerability of Amazon forests to fires, thus enabling more effective management with benefits for climate and air quality.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1209472,"Chen, Y; Randerson, JT; Morton, DC; DeFries, RS; Collatz, GJ; Kasibhatla, PS; Giglio, L; Jin, YF; Marlier, ME",2011,Article,Science,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
238,Seasonal forecasting of tuna habitat for dynamic spatial management,"Capture of the target, bycatch, and protected species in fisheries is often regulated through spatial measures that partition fishing effort, including areal closures. In eastern Australian waters, southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) are a quota-limited species in a multispecies longline fishery; minimizing capture by nonquota holders is an important management concern. A habitat preference model (conditioned with electronic tag data) coupled with ocean reanalysis data has been used since 2003 to generate real-time predicted maps of SBT distribution (nowcasts). These maps are used by fishery managers to restrict fisher access to areas with high predicted SBT distribution. Here we use the coupled ocean-atmosphere model, POAMA (predictive ocean atmosphere model for Australia), and a habitat model to forecast SBT distribution at lead times of up to 4 months. These forecasts are comparable with nowcasts derived from the operational system, and show skill in predicting SBT habitat boundaries out to lead-times of 3-4 months. For this fishery, seasonal forecasts can provide managers and fishers with valuable insights into future habitat distributions for the upcoming months, to better inform operational decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1139/F2011-031,"Hobday, AJ; Hartog, JR; Spillman, CM; Alves, O",2011,Article,Can.

We describe two nonlinear forecasting models that test for the hallmarks of complex behavior, avoid problems of structural uncertainty, and produce good forecasts of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) time series in both standardized and nominal (unprocessed) form. We analyze a spatially extensive, 40-year-long data set of annual CPUE time series of North Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from 1 degrees x 1 degrees cells from the eastern North Pacific Ocean. The use of spatially structured data in compositing techniques improves out-of-sample forecasts of CPUE and overcomes difficulties commonly encountered when using short, incomplete time series. These CPUE series display low-dimensional, nonlinear structure and significant predictability. Such characteristics have important implications for industry efficiency in terms of future planning and can inform formal stock assessments used for the management of fisheries.",https://doi.org/10.1139/F10-160,"Glaser, SM; Ye, H; Maunder, M; MacCall, A; Fogarty, M; Sugihara, G",2011,Article,Can.

229,Integrated Control Measures Against Viruses and their Vectors,"Viruses and their vectors produce severe damage to crops worldwide. This chapter focuses on the strategies and tactics often used to manage vectors of plant viruses, with special attention to insects, by far the most important type of vector. The philosophy and principles of integrated pest management (LPM) developed long ago can still provide an effective and sustainable way to manage insect vectors of virus diseases. Preventative strategies such as the development of models that forecast virus disease outbreaks together with host plant resistance, cultural and physical tactics are the most effective ways to control non-persistently transmitted viruses. A reduction in vector numbers using conventional systemic insecticides or inundative biological control agents can also provide effective control of persistently transmitted viruses. Recent advances on understanding of the mode of transmission of plant viruses are also a very promising way to develop molecules to block putative virus binding sites within the vector and to avoid virus retention and transmission. Also, the characterization of aphid's salivary components that is under way may facilitate the development of new tools to interfere with the process of tram mission of plant viruses.",NA,"Fereres, A; Moreno, A",2011,Article; Book Chapter,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA

The main aim was to analyze pollen season trends from 1992 to 2010 in Andalusia; models were also constructed to forecast the start of the season. Daily pollen counts were recorded using Hirst-type volumetric spore-traps. Pollen season start-dates were very similar at all sites, usually occurring in March. The pollen season was delayed over the study period. The Pollen-season duration and Pollen index generally increased throughout the study period. The starting date for temperature accumulation was around the 10th February, although the threshold temperatures varied by site. The regional model for Andalusia failed to provide sufficiently accurate results compared with sub-regional or local models.

The data used include 366 monthly series, 427 quarterly series and 518 annual series, all supplied to us by either tourism bodies or academics who had used them in previous tourism forecasting studies. The forecasting methods implemented in the competition are univariate and multivariate time series approaches, and econometric models. This forecasting competition differs from previous competitions in several ways: (i) we concentrate on tourism data only; (ii) we include approaches with explanatory variables; (iii) we evaluate the forecast interval coverage as well as the point forecast accuracy; (iv) we observe the effect of temporal aggregation on the forecasting accuracy; and (v) we consider the mean absolute scaled error as an alternative forecasting accuracy measure. We find that pure time series approaches provide more accurate forecasts for tourism data than models with explanatory variables. For seasonal data we implement three fully automated pure time series algorithms that generate accurate point forecasts, and two of these also produce forecast coverage probabilities which are satisfactorily close to the nominal rates. For annual data we find that Naive forecasts are hard to beat. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

419,Spatial estimation of the density and carbon content of host populations for Phytophthora ramorum in California and Oregon,"Outbreak of the emerging infectious disease sudden oak death continues to threaten California and Oregon forests following introduction of the exotic plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Identifying areas at risk and forecasting changes in forest carbon following disease outbreak requires an understanding of the geographical distribution of host populations, which is unknown. In this study, we quantify and map the population density and carbon contents of five key host species for P. ramorum in California and Oregon, including four hosts killed by the pathogen (Notholithocarpus densiflorus, Quercus agrifolia, Quercus kelloggii and Quercus chrysolepis) and the foliar host Umbellularia californica which supports high sporulation rates. We integrate multiple sources of vegetation data, assembled from sparsely distributed (regional-scale) forest inventory and analysis (FIA) plots and more densely distributed (landscape-scale) plots for monitoring sudden oak death, and develop spatial prediction models based on correlation with environmental variables and spatial dependencies in host abundance. We estimate that 1.8 billion N. densiflorus trees (68 Tg C) and 2.6 billion Quercus host trees (227 Tg C) occur across 3.9 and 17.7 million ha of their respective habitat. A total of 436 million U. californica trees (14 Tg C) occur across 4.2 million ha which frequently overlap with Quercus and N. densiflorus host populations. Combination of landscape-scale data with FIA data resulted in more accurate estimation of host populations and their carbon contents. Forests of northern California and southwest Oregon have the highest concentration of the most susceptible hosts along with climatic conditions that favor pathogen spread. This study represents the first spatially-explicit estimate of P. ramorum host populations and their carbon contents which exceed previously published estimates. Our results will inform landscape- to regional-scale models of disease dynamics and guide management decisions regarding ecosystem impacts including risk of C release following widespread tree mortality.

49,Predicting foraging wading bird populations in Everglades National Park from seasonal hydrologic statistics under different management scenarios,"The ability to map relationships between ecological outcomes and hydrologic conditions in the Everglades National Park (ENP) is a key building block for their restoration program, a primary goal of which is to improve conditions for wading birds. This paper presents a model linking wading bird foraging numbers to hydrologic conditions in the ENP. Seasonal hydrologic statistics derived from a single water level recorder are well correlated with water depths throughout most areas of the ENP, and are effective as predictors of wading bird numbers when using a nonlinear hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the conditional distribution of bird populations. Model parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure. Parameter and model uncertainty is assessed as a byproduct of the estimation process. Water depths at the beginning of the nesting season, the average dry season water level, and the numbers of reversals from the dry season recession are identified as significant predictors, consistent with the hydrologic conditions considered important in the production and concentration of prey organisms in this system. Long-term hydrologic records at the index location allow for a retrospective analysis (1952-2006) of foraging bird numbers showing low frequency oscillations in response to decadal fluctuations in hydroclimatic conditions. Simulations of water levels at the index location used in the Bayesian model under alternative water management scenarios allow the posterior probability distributions of the number of foraging birds to be compared, thus providing a mechanism for linking management schemes to seasonal rainfall forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2010WR009552,"Kwon, HH; Lall, U; Engel, V",2011,Article,Water Resour.

147,A novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA models for time series forecasting,"Improving forecasting especially time series forecasting accuracy is an important yet often difficult task facing decision makers in many areas. Both theoretical and empirical findings have indicated that integration of different models can be an effective way of improving upon their predictive performance, especially when the models in combination are quite different. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are flexible computing frameworks and universal approximators that can be applied to a wide range of forecasting problems with a high degree of accuracy. However, using ANNs to model linear problems have yielded mixed results, and hence; it is not wise to apply ANNs blindly to any type of data. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are one of the most popular linear models in time series forecasting, which have been widely applied in order to construct more accurate hybrid models during the past decade. Although, hybrid techniques, which decompose a time series into its linear and nonlinear components, have recently been shown to be successful for single models, these models have some disadvantages. In this paper, a novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA model is proposed in order to overcome mentioned limitation of ANNs and yield more general and more accurate forecasting model than traditional hybrid ARIMA-ANNs models. In our proposed model, the unique advantages of ARIMA models in linear modeling are used in order to identify and magnify the existing linear structure in data, and then a neural network is used in order to determine a model to capture the underlying data generating process and predict, using preprocessed data. Empirical results with three well-known real data sets indicate that the proposed model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by traditional hybrid models and also either of the components models used separately.

119,Assessment of predictive models for chlorophyll-a concentration of a tropical lake,"Background: This study assesses four predictive ecological models; Fuzzy Logic (FL), Recurrent Artificial Neural Network (RANN), Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA) and multiple linear regressions (MLR) to forecast chlorophyll-a concentration using limnological data from 2001 through 2004 of unstratified shallow, oligotrophic to mesotrophic tropical Putrajaya Lake (Malaysia). Performances of the models are assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), and Area under the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Chlorophyll-a have been used to estimate algal biomass in aquatic ecosystem as it is common in most algae. Algal biomass indicates of the trophic status of a water body. Chlorophyll-a therefore, is an effective indicator for monitoring eutrophication which is a common problem of lakes and reservoirs all over the world. Assessments of these predictive models are necessary towards developing a reliable algorithm to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration for eutrophication management of tropical lakes. Results: Same data set was used for models development and the data was divided into two sets; training and testing to avoid biasness in results. FL and RANN models were developed using parameters selected through sensitivity analysis. The selected variables were water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and Secchi depth. Dissolved oxygen, selected through stepwise procedure, was used to develop the MLR model. HEA model used parameters selected using genetic algorithm (GA). The selected parameters were pH, Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen. RMSE, r, and AUC values for MLR model were (4.60, 0.5, and 0.76), FL model were (4.49, 0.6, and 0.84), RANN model were (4.28, 0.7, and 0.79) and HEA model were (4.27, 0.7, and 0.82) respectively. Performance inconsistencies between four models in terms of performance criteria in this study resulted from the methodology used in measuring the performance. RMSE is based on the level of error of prediction whereas AUC is based on binary classification task. Conclusions: Overall, HEA produced the best performance in terms of RMSE, r, and AUC values.

267,Potential performances of remotely sensed LAI assimilation in WOFOST model based on an OSS Experiment,"An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) has been defined to assess the potentialities of assimilating winter wheat leaf area index (LAI) estimations derived from remote sensing into the crop growth model WOFOST. Two assimilation strategies are considered: one based on Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and the second on recalibration/re-initialisation of uncertain model parameters and initial state conditions. The main objective of the OSS Experiment is to estimate the requisites for the remotely sensed LAI, in terms of accuracy and sampling frequency, to reach target of either 25 or 50% reduction of errors on the final estimation of grain yields. Our results demonstrate that EnKF is not suitable for assimilating LAI in WOFOST as the average error on final grain yields estimation globally increases. These poor results can be explained by the possible differences of phenological development existing between assimilated and modelled LAI values (difference called ""phenological shift"" in our study) which is not corrected by the EnKF-based assimilation strategy. On the contrary, a recalibration-based assimilation approach globally improves the estimation of final grain yields in a significant way. On average, such improvement can reach up to approximately 65% when observations are available all along the growing season. Improvements on the order of 20% can be already be attained early in the season, which is of great interest in a crop yield forecasting perspective. If the first objective (25%) of error reduction on final grain yields can be reached in a quite high number of assimilated LAI observations availabilities and uncertainty levels, the field of possibilities is significantly restricted for the second objective (50%) and implies to have LAI observations available all along the growing season, at least on a weekly basis and with an uncertainty level equal or ideally lower than 10%. These requirements are not currently met from neither a technological nor an operational point of view but the results presented here can provide guidelines for future missions dedicated to crop growth monitoring.

176,Evaluation of IRI's Seasonal Climate Forecasts for the Extreme 15% Tails,"This paper evaluates the quality of real-time seasonal probabilistic forecasts of the extreme 15% tails of the climatological distribution of temperature and precipitation issued by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) from 1998 through 2009. IRI's forecasts have been based largely on a two-tiered multimodel dynamical prediction system. Forecasts of the 15% extremes have been consistent with the corresponding probabilistic forecasts for the standard tercile-based categories; however, nonclimatological forecasts for the extremes have been issued sparingly. Results indicate positive skill in terms of resolution and discrimination for the extremes forecasts, particularly in the tropics. Additionally, with the exception of some overconfidence for extreme above-normal precipitation and a strong cool bias for temperature, reliability analyses suggest generally good calibration. Skills for temperature are generally higher than those for precipitation, due both to correct forecasts of increased probabilities of extremely high (above the upper 15th percentile) temperatures associated with warming trends, and to better discrimination of interannual variability. However, above-normal temperature extremes were substantially underforecast, as noted also for the IRI's tercile forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-10-05009.1,"Barnston, AG; Mason, SJ",2011,Article,Weather Forecast.,English,mary lofton,NA,1,0,1,NA,,,NA
341,An adaptive neuro-fuzzy approach for modeling of water-in-oil emulsion formation,"Oil composition and properties including density, viscosity, asphaltene, saturate, aromatics and resin contents are responsible factors for the formation of water-in-crude-oil emulsions. These factors can be used to develop an stability index which determines states of water-in-oil emulsion in terms of either an unstable, entrained, mesostable or stable conditions. It is important to note that most of the regression models cannot capture the non-linear relationships involved in the formation of these emulsions. This study deals with the prediction of water-in-oil emulsions stability by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with basic compositional factors such as density, viscosity and percentages of SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes) components. In the computational method, grid partition and subtractive clustering fuzzy inference systems were tried to generate the optimum fuzzy rule base sets. The stability estimation was conducted by applying hybrid learning algorithm and the model performance was tested by the means of distinct test data set randomly selected from the experimental domain. The ANFIS-based predictions were also compared to the conventional regression approach by means of various descriptive statistical indicators, such as root mean-square error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), the factor of two (FA2), fractional variance (FV), proportion of systematic error (PSE), etc. With trying various types of fuzzy inference system (FIS) structures and several numbers of training epochs ranging from 1 to 100, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 2.0907) and the highest determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.967) were obtained with subtractive clustering method of a first-order Sugeno type FIS. For the optimum ANFIS structure, input variables were fuzzified with four Gaussian membership functions, and the number of training epochs was computed as 21. In the computational analysis, the predictive performance of the ANFIS model was examined for the following ranges of the clustering parameters: range of influence (ROI) = 0.45-0.60, squash factor (SF) = 1.20-1.35, accept ratio (AR) = 0.40-0.55, and reject ratio (RR) = 0.10-0.20. Results indicated that ROI, SF, AR and RR were obtained to be 0.54, 1.25, 0.50 and 0.15, respectively, for the best FIS structure. It was clearly concluded that the proposed ANFIS model demonstrated a superior predictive performance on forecasting of water-in-oil emulsions stability. Findings of this study clearly indicated that the neuro-fuzzy modeling could be successfully used for predicting the stability of a specific water-in-oil mixture to provide a good discrimination between several visual stability conditions.

175,"Hydrologic Effects of Urbanization and Climate Change on the Flint River Basin, Georgia","The potential effects of long-term urbanization and climate change on the freshwater resources of the Flint River basin were examined by using the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS). PRMS is a deterministic, distributed-parameter watershed model developed to evaluate the effects of various combinations of precipitation, temperature, and land cover on streamflow and multiple intermediate hydrologic states. Precipitation and temperature output from five general circulation models (GCMs) using one current and three future climate-change scenarios were statistically down-scaled for input into PRMS. Projections of urbanization through 2050 derived for the Flint River basin by the Forecasting Scenarios of Future Land-Cover (FORE-SCE) land-cover change model were also used as input to PRMS. Comparison of the central tendency of streamflow simulated based on the three climate-change scenarios showed a slight decrease in overall streamflow relative to simulations under current conditions, mostly caused by decreases in the surface-runoff and groundwater components. The addition of information about forecasted urbanization of land surfaces to the hydrologic simulation mitigated the decreases in streamflow, mainly by increasing surface runoff.",https://doi.org/10.1175/2010EI369.1,"Viger, RJ; Hay, LE; Markstrom, SL; Jones, JW; Buell, GR",2011,Article,Earth Interact.,English,mary lofton,NA,0,0,1,NA,,,NA
403,Investigation into mountain pine beetle above-canopy dispersion using weather radar and an atmospheric dispersion model,"Above-canopy, wind-assisted mountain pine beetle (MPB) dispersion in British Columbia (BC) is examined during the summer 2005 beetle emergence period. Above-canopy dispersion is simulated by the HYSPLIT atmospheric dispersion model using back trajectories started from locations identified by clear-air returns from the Prince George BC weather radar station. The dispersion calculations are carried out over the 10 days showing the highest intensity of clear-air returns from the 2005 emergence season. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used to simulate the meteorological conditions during each of the 10 emergence days. Cumulative clear-air returns throughout each emergence day are used to estimate the distribution of beetle emergence times and atmospheric residence times. Evaluation of the WRF model output is presented using both surface and upper air observations. Evaluation of the HYSPLIT model is performed through a comparison of the vertical distribution of MPB observed in a previous study. A secondary HYSPLIT evaluation is performed using aerial surveys taken during the following summer (2006), which identify the previous years' beetle-infested regions. Beetle flight distances from the time of beetle emergence to the time of peak clear-air returns are calculated for each trajectory, and the distribution of all flight distances is presented. The mean back trajectory distance is 20.2 km with a standard deviation of 13.6 km. These values represent the MPB flight distance during half of the beetle atmospheric residence time, and typical daily wind-assisted dispersion distances would be expected to be roughly double this value. Mean beetle residence time in the atmosphere over the 10 emergence events is found to be 3.2 h.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10453-010-9176-9,"Ainslie, B; Jackson, PL",2011,Article,Aerobiologia,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
291,The impact of climate change on the performance of rebuilding strategies for overfished groundfish species of the US west coast,"Management Strategy Evaluation is used to evaluate the performance of management procedures based on how management decisions are made for groundfish stocks off the U.S. west coast. The analyses focus on rebuilding the stock of Pacific ocean perch to its target level when future recruitment may exhibit a long-term trend, owing to environmental forcing. Several variants of the management procedure currently used to provide scientific management advice for U.S. west coast groundfish are evaluated. The performance of variants of this management procedure which ""know"" (on average) the true relationship between recruitment and the environmental variable driving recruitment is not superior to that of a management procedure which bases forecasts of recruitment on average historical recruitment. Moreover, the best performance in terms of recovery rates occurs when rebuilding decisions are based on a relatively high probability of recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

37,Increasing Potential Risk of a Global Aquatic Invader in Europe in Contrast to Other Continents under Future Climate Change,"Background: Anthropogenically-induced climate change can alter the current climatic habitat of non-native species and can have complex effects on potentially invasive species. Predictions of the potential distributions of invasive species under climate change will provide critical information for future conservation and management strategies. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to invasive species and climate change, but the effect of climate change on invasive species distributions has been rather neglected, especially for notorious global invaders. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used ecological niche models (ENMs) to assess the risks and opportunities that climate change presents for the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which is a worldwide aquatic invasive species. Linking the factors of climate, topography, habitat and human influence, we developed predictive models incorporating both native and non-native distribution data of the crayfish to identify present areas of potential distribution and project the effects of future climate change based on a consensus-forecast approach combining the CCCMA and HADCM3 climate models under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) by 2050. The minimum temperature from the coldest month, the human footprint and precipitation of the driest quarter contributed most to the species distribution models. Under both the A2a and B2a scenarios, P. clarkii shifted to higher latitudes in continents of both the northern and southern hemispheres. However, the effect of climate change varied considerately among continents with an expanding potential in Europe and contracting changes in others. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings are the first to predict the impact of climate change on the future distribution of a globally invasive aquatic species. We confirmed the complexities of the likely effects of climate change on the potential distribution of globally invasive species, and it is extremely important to develop wide-ranging and effective control measures according to predicted geographical shifts and changes.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018429,"Liu, XA; Guo, ZW; Ke, ZW; Wang, SP; Li, YM",2011,Article,PLoS One,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
382,State prediction of algae reproduction based on learning algorithm of fuzzy nearest neighbor clustering,"In order to forecast the occurrence of red tide in the ocean, it is necessary to observe the state of algae reproduction in seawater. A method was proposed for forecasting the state of algae reproduction indirectly by modeling to predict the concentration of chlorophyll-a. Data-driven learning algorithm of fuzzy nearest neighbor clustering was used for pretreatment of sampling data. State prediction model for concentration of chlorophyll-a in seawater was built based on the optimal fuzzy logic system. Considering the character of sampling data and the demand of decreasing the rank of the model, a kind of improved learning algorithm of fuzzy nearest neighbor clustering was designed, and it was used in the state prediction for concentration of chlorophyll-a. The experiment indicates that the improved method can effectively extract the character of sampling data, reduce the dimension of the data, and improve the convergence speed of algorithm learning. The improved fuzzy nearest neighbor clustering algorithm reduces the complexity of modeling for prediction, and this kind of model has fine performance of generalization. It can effectively predict the state of algae reproduction in seawater.",https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.356-360.929,"Zhang, Y",2012,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,modeling,NA
385,"Dynamic versus static neural network model for rainfall forecasting at Klang River Basin, Malaysia","Rainfall is considered as one of the major components of the hydrological process; it takes significant part in evaluating drought and flooding events. Therefore, it is important to have an accurate model for rainfall forecasting. Recently, several data-driven modeling approaches have been investigated to perform such forecasting tasks as multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP-NN). In fact, the rainfall time series modeling involves an important temporal dimension. On the other hand, the classical MLP-NN is a static and has a memoryless network architecture that is effective for complex nonlinear static mapping. This research focuses on investigating the potential of introducing a neural network that could address the temporal relationships of the rainfall series. Two different static neural networks and one dynamic neural network, namely the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and input delay neural network (IDNN), respectively, have been examined in this study. Those models had been developed for the two time horizons for monthly and weekly rainfall forecasting at Klang River, Malaysia. Data collected over 12 yr (1997-2008) on a weekly basis and 22 yr (1987-2008) on a monthly basis were used to develop and examine the performance of the proposed models. Comprehensive comparison analyses were carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed static and dynamic neural networks. Results showed that the MLP-NN neural network model is able to follow trends of the actual rainfall, however, not very accurately. RBFNN model achieved better accuracy than the MLP-NN model. Moreover, the forecasting accuracy of the IDNN model was better than that of static network during both training and testing stages, which proves a consistent level of accuracy with seen and unseen data.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-16-1151-2012,"El-Shafie, A; Noureldin, A; Taha, M; Hussain, A; Mukhlisin, M",2012,Article,Hydrol.

148,"Hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model for short-term forecasts of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu, China","Phytoplankton biomass is an important factor for short-term forecasts of algal blooms. Our new hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model is primarily intended for simulating the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu within a time frame of 1-5 days. The model combines two modules: a simple phytoplankton kinetics module for growth and loss; and a mass-transport module, which defines phytoplankton transport horizontally with a two dimensional hydrodynamic model. To adapt field data for model input and calibration, we introduce two simplifications: (a) exclusion of some processes related to phytoplankton dynamics like nutrient dynamics, sediment resuspension, mineralization and nitrification, and (b) use of monthly measured data of the nutrient state. Chlorophyll-a concentration, representing phytoplankton biomass, is the only state variable in the model. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the most sensitive parameter set in the phytoplankton kinetics module. The model was calibrated with field data collected in 2008 and validated with additional data obtained in 2009. A comparison of simulated and observed chlorophyll-a concentration for 33 grid cells achieved an accuracy of 78.7%. However, mean percent error and mean absolute percent error were 13.4% and 58.2%, respectively, which implies that further improvement is necessary, e.g. by reducing uncertainty of the model input and by an improved parameter calibration.

124,Satellite microwave remote sensing for environmental modeling of mosquito population dynamics,"Environmental variability has important influences on mosquito life cycles and understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of mosquito populations is critical for mosquito control and vector-borne disease prevention. Meteorological data used for model-based predictions of mosquito abundance and life cycle dynamics are typically acquired from ground-based weather stations: however, data availability and completeness are often limited by sparse networks and resource availability. In contrast, environmental measurements from satellite remote sensing are more spatially continuous and can be retrieved automatically. This study compared environmental measurements from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and in situ weather station data to examine their ability to predict the abundance of two important mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex tarsalis) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA from 2005 to 2010. The AMSR-E land parameters included daily surface water inundation fraction, surface air temperature, soil moisture, and microwave vegetation opacity. The AMSR-E derived models had better fits and higher forecasting accuracy than models based on weather station data despite the relatively coarse (25-km) spatial resolution of the satellite data. In the AMSR-E models, air temperature and surface water fraction were the best predictors of Aedes vexans, whereas air temperature and vegetation opacity were the best predictors of Cx. tarsalis abundance. The models were used to extrapolate spatial, seasonal, and interannual patterns of climatic suitability for mosquitoes across eastern South Dakota. Our findings demonstrate that environmental metrics derived from satellite passive microwave radiometry are suitable for predicting mosquito population dynamics and can potentially improve the effectiveness of mosquito-borne disease early warning systems.

407,Forecasting the number of extreme daily events on seasonal timescales,"We investigate the potential for skillfully predicting the number of daily temperature extremes over 3 month (seasonal) periods. We use retrospective forecasts from the Met Office seasonal forecasting system, GloSea4, nominally initialized 1 month ahead of the target season. Initially, we define daily extremes to be events outside either the upper or lower deciles of the daily temperature distribution from the relevant season. This definition provides a threshold that is sufficiently ""extreme"" to be of interest to many users but moderate enough to allow a sufficient sample for verification and to be of regular use to users. We show that skill reduces slightly at more extreme thresholds. Correlations of predicted and observed numbers of upper or lower decile extreme days over a season are significantly greater than zero over much of the globe and, in general, are better than a persistence forecast. Forecast skill for seasonal mean temperature is similar to, but generally greater than, the skill of predictions of the number of extreme days. Observations have a strong relationship between the seasonal mean and the number of extreme days. We show that the skill in predicting the number of extreme days is largely a consequence of this relationship and occurs primarily through a shift in the distribution of the daily data rather than a change of its shape. The ability to predict the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and climate change are both significant contributors to the skill in predicting temperature extremes. In summer, significant skill also comes from initializing soil moisture.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016541,"Hamilton, E; Eade, R; Graham, RJ; Scaife, AA; Smith, DM; Maidens, A; MacLachlan, C",2012,Article,J.

225,Machine Learning for Predictive Management: Short and Long term Prediction of Phytoplankton Biomass using Genetic Algorithm Based Recurrent Neural Networks,"In the regulated Nakdong River, algal proliferations are annually observed in some seasons, with cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) appearing in summer and diatom blooms (Stephanodiscus hantzschii) in winter. This study aims to develop two ecological models forecasting future chlorophyll a at two time-steps (one-week and one-year forecasts), using recurrent neural networks tuned by genetic algorithm (GA-RNN). A moving average (MA) method pre-processes the data for both short- and long-term forecasting to evaluate the effect of noise downscaling on model predictability and to estimate its usefulness and trend prediction for management purposes. Twenty-five physicochemical and biological components (e.g. water temperature, DO, pH, dams discharge, river flow, rainfall, zooplankton abundance, nutrient concentration, etc. from 1994 to 2006) are used as input variables to predict chlorophyll a. GA-RNN models show a satisfactory level of performance for both predictions. Using genetic operations in the network training enables us to avoid numerous trial-and-error model constructions. MA-smoothed data improves the predictivity of models by removing residuals in the data prediction and enhancing the trend of time-series patterns. The results demonstrate efficient development of ecological models through selecting appropriate network structures. Data pre-processing with MA helps in forecasting long-term seasonality and trend of chlorophyll a, an important outcome for decision makers because it provides more reaction time to establish and control management strategies.",NA,"Kim, DK; Jeong, KS; McKay, RIB; Chon, TS; Joo, GJ",2012,Article,Int.

269,A Bayesian Approach to Estimating Agricultural Yield Based on Multiple Repeated Surveys,"Forecasting the end-of-year crop yield is critical for agricultural decision-making and inherently difficult. Historically, a panel of commodity specialists known as the Agricultural Statistics Board convene regularly to set estimates based on expert review of a combination of survey data and administrative/auxiliary information. To make this process less subjective and more repeatable, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that produces superior yield forecasts/estimates, while quantifying different sources of uncertainty. The proposed hierarchical model naturally combines information from multiple monthly surveys measured on different temporal supports, including a field measurement survey and two farmer interview surveys. The dependence between the monthly updated surveys and the serial dependence of the annual yield are incorporated at different levels of the hierarchy. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an application from the US Department of Agriculture. Empirical results indicate that the hierarchical model produces superior forecasts to both the panel of experts and the composite estimator developed by Keller and Olkin (Technical Report, National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2002), while providing an accurate measure of uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-011-0067-5,"Wang, JQC; Holan, SH; Nandram, B; Barboza, W; Toto, C; Anderson, E",2012,Article,J.

144,Modeling the dispersion of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. pollen with the model system COSMO-ART,"Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is a highly allergenic plant that is spreading throughout Europe. Ragweed pollen can be transported over large distances by the wind. Even low pollen concentrations of less than 10 pollen m(-3) can lead to health problems in sensitive persons. Therefore, forecasting the airborne concentrations of ragweed pollen is becoming more and more important for public health. The question remains whether distant pollen sources need to be considered in reliable forecasts. We used the extended numerical weather prediction system COSMO-ART to simulate the release and transport of ragweed pollen in central Europe. A pollen episode (September 12-16, 2006) in north-eastern Germany was modeled in order to find out where the pollen originated. For this purpose, several different source regions were taken into account and their individual impact on the daily mean pollen concentration and the performance of the forecast were studied with the means of a 2 x 2 contingency table and skill scores. It was found that the majority of the pollen originated in local areas, but up to 20% of the total pollen load came from distant sources in Hungary.

In the management of Hyriopsis Cumingii ponds, dissolved oxygen (DO) is the key point to measure, predict and control. In this study, we analyzes the important factors for predicting dissolved oxygen of Hyriopsis Cumingii ponds, and finally chooses solar radiation(SR), water temperature(WT), wind speed(WS), PH and oxygen(DO) as six input parameters. In this paper, Elman neural networks were used to predict and forecast quantitative characteristics of water. As the dissolved oxygen in the outdoor pond is low controllability and scalability, this paper proposes a predicting model for dissolved oxygen. The true power and advantage of this method lie in its ability to (1) represent both linear and non-linear relationships and (2) learn these relationships directly from the data being modeled. The study focuses on Singapore coastal waters. The Elman NN model is built for quick assessment and forecasting of selected water quality variables at any location in the domain of interest.

In a temperate, humid grassland, we examined the seasonal impacts of climate variability on 27 y of grass productivity. Drought and high-intensity precipitation reduced grass productivity only during a 110-d period, whereas high temperatures reduced productivity only during 25 d in July. The effects of drought and heat waves declined over the season and had no detectable impact on grass productivity in August.

Seven input variables, including four important meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and solar radiation) and the ambient concentrations of three gaseous pollutants (methane, carbon monoxide and ozone) were fuzzified using a sytem with a graphical user interface (GUI) and an artificial intelligence-based approach. Trapezoidal membership functions with ten and fifteen levels were employed for the fuzzy subsets of each model variable. A Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system (FIS) was developed to introduce a total of 146 rules in the IF-THEN format. The product (prod) and the centre of gravity (centroid) methods were performed as the inference operator and defuzzification methods, respectively, for the proposed FIS. The results obtained using uzzy-logic were compared with the outputs of an exponential regression model. The predictive performances of the models were compared based on various descriptive statistical indicators, and the proposed method was tested against additional observed data.

223,Application of receptor models on water quality data in source apportionment in Kuantan River Basin,"Recent techniques in the management of surface river water have been expanding the demand on the method that can provide more representative of multivariate data set. A proper technique of the architecture of artificial neural network (ANN) model and multiple linear regression (MLR) provides an advance tool for surface water modeling and forecasting. The development of receptor model was applied in order to determine the major sources of pollutants at Kuantan River Basin, Malaysia. Thirteen water quality parameters were used in principal component analysis (PCA) and new variables of fertilizer waste, surface runoff, anthropogenic input, chemical and mineral changes and erosion are successfully developed for modeling purposes. Two models were compared in terms of efficiency and goodness-of-fit for water quality index (WQI) prediction. The results show that APCS-ANN model gives better performance with high R-2 value (0.9680) and small root mean square error (RMSE) value (2.6409) compared to APCS-MLR model.

198,A cold oceanographic regime with high exploitation rates in the Northeast Pacific forecasts a collapse of the sardine stock,"The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1113806109,"Zwolinski, JP; Demer, DA",2012,Article,Proc.

460,Fuzzy-logic modeling of Fenton's oxidation of anaerobically pretreated poultry manure wastewater,"A multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) fuzzy-logic-based model was proposed to estimate color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies in the post-treatment of anaerobically pretreated poultry manure wastewater effluent using Fenton's oxidation process. Three main input variables including initial pH, Fe+2, and H2O2 dosages were fuzzified in a new numerical modeling scheme by the use of an artificial intelligence-based approach. Trapezoidal membership functions with eight levels were conducted for the fuzzy subsets, and a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system was used to implement a total of 70 rules in the IF-THEN format. The product (prod) and the center of gravity (centroid) methods were applied as the inference operator and defuzzification methods, respectively. Fuzzy-logic predicted results were compared with the outputs of two first-order polynomial regression models derived in the scope of this study. Estimated results were also compared to the multiple regression approach by means of various descriptive statistical indicators, such as root mean-squared error, index of agreement, fractional variance, proportion of systematic error, etc. Results of the statistical analysis clearly revealed that, compared to conventional regression models, the proposed MIMO fuzzy-logic model produced very smaller deviations and demonstrated a superior predictive performance on forecasting of color and COD removal efficiencies with satisfactory determination coefficients over 0.98. Due to high capability of the fuzzy-logic methodology in capturing the non-linear interactions, it was demonstrated that a complex dynamic system, such as Fenton's oxidation, could be easily modeled.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0726-7,"Yetilmezsoy, K",2012,Article,Environ.

424,Estimating regional wheat yield from the shape of decreasing curves of green area index temporal profiles retrieved from MODIS data,"Earth observation data, owing to their synoptic, timely and repetitive coverage, have been recognized as a valuable tool for crop monitoring at different levels. At the field level, the close correlation between green leaf area (GLA) during maturation and grain yield in wheat revealed that the onset and rate of senescence appeared to be important factors for determining wheat grain yield. Our study sought to explore a simple approach for wheat yield forecasting at the regional level, based on metrics derived from the senescence phase of the green area index (GAI) retrieved from remote sensing data. This study took advantage of recent methodological improvements in which imagery with high revisit frequency but coarse spatial resolution can be exploited to derive crop-specific GAI time series by selecting pixels whose ground-projected instantaneous field of view is dominated by the target crop: winter wheat. A logistic function was used to characterize the GAI senescence phase and derive the metrics of this phase. Four regression-based models involving these metrics (i.e., the maximum GAI value, the senescence rate and the thermal time taken to reach 50% of the green surface in the senescent phase) were related to official wheat yield data. The performances of such models at this regional scale showed that final yield could be estimated with an RMSE of 0.57 ton ha(-1), representing about 7% as relative RMSE. Such an approach may be considered as a first yield estimate that could be performed in order to provide better integrated yield assessments in operational systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AIRPACT-3 column densities showed high correlation (R > 0.9) but were significantly biased (similar to 25%) with consistent under-predictions for spring months when there is significant transport from Asia. The AIRPACT-3 CO bias relative to AIRS was eliminated by incorporating dynamic boundary conditions derived from NCAR's MOZART forecasts with assimilated MOPITT carbon monoxide.

363,Modeling Water-in-Oil Emulsion Formation Using Fuzzy Logic,"Several compositional factors including density, viscosity, asphaltene, aromatic, saturate and resin contents play an important role to compute a class index (Stability C) which yields either an unstable or entrained water-in-oil state or a meso-stable or stable emulsion. Considering the complex structure and tedious determination procedures of water-in-oil emulsions-based problems, old regression models are not able to capture the nonlinear relationships existing between variables in a complex water-in-oil emulsion system. To undertake these tasks, derivation of a motivation for developing a robust and reliable model has become a particular field of investigation to predict a proper stability index due the involved uncertainties and their poor generalization performance. Recently, it has become apparent that alternative artificial intelligence-based methods, such as fuzzy logic methodology, have been successfully used to deal with subjects having ambiguities and uncertainties. In this study, a MISO (multiple inputs and single output) fuzzy-logic-based model was proposed as a new numerical modeling scheme for the prediction of water-in-oil emulsions formation. The fuzzy-logic predictions were compared to the actual data from some common oils and against a 15-term old regression model. Statistical results clearly indicated that, compared to the regression approach, the proposed MISO fuzzy-logic-based model showed a superior predictive performance on forecasting of water-in-oil emulsions stability with a satisfactory determination coefficient over 0.98.",NA,"Yetilmezsoy, K; Fingas, M; Fieldhouse, B",2012,Article,J.

The models used the comprehensive 8 years' monthly water quality data for training, and the most recent 3 years' monthly data for testing. Twenty four water quality variables including physical, chemical and biological parameters were involved. The nonlinear process with measurement noise was regressed by RVM that is based on Bayesian framework, and the near-optimal set points maximizing the objective function were sought by GA.

133,Prediction of Aquaculture Water Quality Based on Combining Principal Component Analysis and Least Square Support Vector Regression,"The traditional methods about the water quality prediction in the aquaculture can't resolve the data redundancy and complex characters, which makes the accuracy of forecast precision low. In order to improve the accuracy of model prediction and the response time, this study demonstrates a new prediction method based on combing principal component analysis and least square support vector regression (PCA-LSSVR). The principal component analysis (PCA) method is applied to dimension reduction which reduces redundant data between various factors and extracting the principal components, then the data pre-processing is finished. The least square support vector regression (LSSVR) method is for modelling and forecasting to the principal components. Comparative experiment of the water quality is conducted on the base of river crab aquaculture ponds in Yixing. The experimental results show that the model of PCA-LSSVR outperforms standard LSSVR in performance on average, and the dimension of the sample set not only can be reduced and the water quality prediction accuracy can also be improved effectively.

81,Ecological forecasting in Chesapeake Bay: Using a mechanistic-empirical modeling approach,"The Chesapeake Bay Ecological Prediction System (CBEPS) automatically generates daily nowcasts and three-day forecasts of several environmental variables, such as sea-surface temperature and salinity, the concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen, and the likelihood of encountering several noxious species, including harmful algal blooms and water-borne pathogens, for the purpose of monitoring the Bay's ecosystem. While the physical and biogeochemical variables are forecast mechanistically using the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the Chesapeake Bay, the species predictions are generated using a novel mechanistic-empirical approach, whereby real-time output from the coupled physical-biogeochemical model drives multivariate empirical habitat models of the target species. The predictions, in the form of digital images, are available via the World Wide Web to interested groups to guide recreational, management, and research activities. Though full validation of the integrated forecasts for all species is still a work in progress, we argue that the mechanistic-empirical approach can be used to generate a wide variety of short-term ecological forecasts, and that it can be applied in any marine system where sufficient data exist to develop empirical habitat models. This paper provides an overview of this system, its predictions, and the approach taken.

311,Assimilating Remotely Sensed Information with the WheatGrow Model Based on the Ensemble Square Root Filter for Improving Regional Wheat Yield Forecasts,"In this study, a deterministic algorithm named Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF), an algorithm significantly improved from the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), was used to integrate remotely sensed information (ASD spectral data, HJ-1 A/B CCD and Landsat-5 TM data) with a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth model (WheatGrow). The analyzed values of model variables, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), were calculated based on EnSRF without perturbed measurements. Independent datasets were used to test EnSRF and the root mean square error (RASE) values were 0.81 and 0.82 g m(-2), with relative error (RE) values of 0.15 and 0.13, for LAI and LNA, respectively. RMSE values for IAI and LNA were 1.39 and 1.70 g m(-2) respectively (RE, 0.28 and 0.34) based on EnKF, 1.17 and 1.80 g m(-2) (RE, 0.24 and 0.35), respectively, based on the WheatGrow model alone, and 0.97 and 1.25 g m(-2) (RE, 0.21 and 0.24), respectively, based on the remote sensing models. These results indicated that the LAI and LNA values based on EnSRF matched the measured values well compared with the EnKF, WheatGrow and remote sensing models. In addition, the predicted results are consistent with the temporal and spatial distribution of winter wheat growth status and grain yields in the study area, with RE values of less than 0.2 and 0.1 for LAI and LNA, respectively. These results provide an important approach for simulating winter wheat growth status based on combining remote sensing and crop growth models.",https://doi.org/10.1626/pps.16.352,"Huang, Y; Zhu, Y; Li, WL; Cao, WX; Tian, YC",2013,Article,Plant.

384,Improving the accuracy and utility of harmful algal bloom forecasting systems,"One of the goals of harmful algal bloom (HAB) research has been to develop predictive capabilities for blooms. Major steps have been made towards this goal, including the development of physical-biological models of HAB species that simulate bloom dynamics in specific regions. In the Gulf of Maine region of the northeastern US, models have been developed that have considerable skill in simulating blooms of Alexandrium fundyense, the causative organism for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks in the region. This model is now being used for both short-term and long-term forecasts. This paper describes several ongoing activities that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the model and forecasts. These include efforts to streamline or minimize the sampling and analysis requirements of annual A. fundyense cyst surveys, efforts to quantitatively describe or characterize the severity of predicted outbreaks and plans to obtain real-time data on Alexandrium cell abundance and toxicity that can be assimilated into the models.

352,An operational model for forecasting ragweed pollen release and dispersion in Europe,"The paper considers the possibilities of modelling the release and dispersion of the pollen of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L), a highly allergenic invasive weed, which is spreading through southern and central Europe. In order to provide timely warnings for the allergy sufferers, a model was developed for forecasting ragweed pollen concentrations in the air. The development was based on the system for integrated modelling of atmospheric composition (SILAM) and concentrated on spatio-temporal modelling of ragweed flowering season and pollen release, which constitutes the emission term. Evaluation of the new model against multi-annual ragweed pollen observations demonstrated that the model reproduces well the main ragweed pollen season in the areas with major plant presence, such as the Pannonian Plain, the Lyon area in France, the Milan region in Italy, Ukraine and southern Russia. The predicted start of the season is mostly within 3 days of the observed for the majority of stations in these areas. The temporal correlation between modelled and observed concentrations exceeds 0.6 for the bulk of the stations. Model application to the seasons of 2005-2011 indicated the regions with high ragweed pollen concentrations, in particular the areas where allergenic thresholds are exceeded. It is demonstrated that, due to long-range transport of pollen, high-concentration areas are substantially more extensive than the heavily infested territories. (C) 2013 The Authors.

442,Evolution of a cyanobacterial bloom forecast system in western Lake Erie: Development and initial evaluation,"In the summer of 2008 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began monitoring cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Erie using high temporal resolution satellite imagery. In 2009, a forecast of bloom transport was also developed using a hydrodynamic model to forecast the trajectory of the bloom. These forecasts have been disseminated from 2008 to the present in the form of a bulletin which is emailed to local managers, health departments, researchers and other stakeholders. The number of bulletins issued each year, as well as the number of subscribers that receive the weekly bulletins, has increased significantly every year that the system has been in place. This manuscript discusses results from the first 3 years that the forecasts were distributed (2008-2010), describes the components of the forecasts, and will conclude with possible improvements that could be made to the forecast system. Harmful algal blooms of the genus Microcystis were found in all 3 years, and the development of these blooms was associated with water temperatures >18 degrees C and wind stresses <0.04 Pa. Wind stresses >0.1 Pa were associated with bloom dispersement as were temperatures <18 degrees C. The present forecasting system was deemed adequate, but improvements in the use of additional remote sensing products and post-processing would yield a more accurate forecast.

The WSE encapsulated external functions, boundary conditions, and parameter settings of the EcoTaihu model and the water-quality data and satellite remote sensing data assimilation modules. The outputs of the WSE prediction were generally consistent with the observations. The user-friendly graphic user interface of WSE was direct-viewing and convenient to operate.

282,Hybrid ANN-GA model for predicting turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentrations,"The transport and fate of admixtures at coastal zones are driven, or at least modulated, by currents. In particular, in tide-dominated areas due to higher near-bottom shear stress at strong currents, sediment concentration and turbidity are expected to be at maximum during spring tide, while algal growth rate likely is peaking up at slack currents during neap tide. Varying weather and atmospheric conditions might modulate the said dependencies, but the water quality pattern still is expected to follow the dominant tidal cycle. As tidal cycling could be predicted well ahead, there is a possibility to use water quality and hydrodynamic high-resolution data to learn past dependencies, and then use tidal hydrodynamic model for nowcasting and forecasting of selected water quality parameters. This paper develops data driven models for nowcasting and forecasting turbidity and chlorophyll-a using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with Genetic Algorithm (GA). The use of GA aims to automate and enhance ANN designing process. The training of the ANN model is done by constructing input-output mapping, where hydrodynamic parameters act as an input for the network, while turbidity and chlorophyll-a are the corresponding outputs (desired target). Afterward, the prediction is carried out only by employing computed water surface elevation as an input for the trained ANN model. The proposed data driven model has successfully revealed complex relationships and utilized its experiential knowledge acquired from the training process for facilitating the subsequent use of the data driven model to yield an accurate prediction.

122,Forecasting animal migration using SARIMAX: an efficient means of reducing silver eel mortality caused by turbines,"Hydroelectric power plants are often considered a major cause of mortality for migratory fish. The endangered status of European eels Anguilla anguilla forces managers to make efforts to reduce this mortality. Among the mitigation measures used, turbine shutdowns appear to be an efficient method, but they involve a substantial financial loss for hydropower producers. To optimise the use of turbine shutdowns, the present study aimed to provide a precise but simple forecast of the migration peaks of migrant silver eels. We first developed a model to forecast silver eel migration using SARIMAX models and real biological data of silver eel migration from 2 fishing sites in Brittany (north-western France). This model combines exogenous covariates and past biological data to forecast future migrations. We then evaluated this model with several years of biological data from the same trap sites, based on the decision criterion that turbines should be shut down when the number of silver eels forecasted by our model represents >10% of the mean annual number of migrants. This model would have served to save 90 and 70% of eels on the Oir and Scorff Rivers, respectively, with only 3.3 to 5.6 turbine shutdowns per year on average. Initial shutdowns would have lasted 1 wk, but this study also showed that the duration of turbine shutdowns could be reduced to 2 d without a significant decrease in efficiency. SARIMAX models reduce the influence of exogenous factors in forecasting outcomes, these being the most variable factors in the current context of climate change. This model appears to be a powerful tool for ecological forecasting of endangered species in the context of global warming.",https://doi.org/10.3354/esr00517,"Trancart, T; Acou, A; De Oliveira, E; Feunteun, E",2013,Article,Endanger.

141,"Impact of bio-optical data assimilation on short-term coupled physical, bio-optical model predictions","Data assimilation experiments with the coupled physical, bio-optical model of Monterey Bay are presented. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the assimilation of satellite-derived bio-optical properties can improve the model predictions (phytoplankton population, chlorophyll) in a coastal ocean on time scales of 1-5 days. The Monterey Bay model consists of a physical model based on the Navy Coastal Ocean Model and a biochemical model which includes three nutrients, two phytoplankton groups (diatoms and small phytoplankton), two groups of zooplankton grazers, and two detrital pools. The Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation system is used for the assimilation of physical observations. For the assimilation of bio-optical observations, we used reduced-order Kalman filter with a stationary forecast error covariance. The forecast error covariance is specified in the subspace of the multivariate (bio-optical, physical) empirical orthogonal functions estimated from a monthlong model run. With the assimilation of satellite-derived bio-optical properties (chlorophyll a or absorption due to phytoplankton), the model was able to reproduce intensity and tendencies in subsurface chlorophyll distributions observed at water sample locations in the Monterey Bay, CA. Data assimilation also improved agreement between the observed and model-predicted ratios between diatoms and small phytoplankton populations. Model runs with or without assimilation of satellite-derived bio-optical observations show underestimated values of nitrate as compared to the water sample observations. We found that an instantaneous update of nitrate based on statistical relations between temperature and nitrate corrected the model underestimation of the nitrate fields during the multivariate update.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrc.20177,"Shulman, I; Frolov, S; Anderson, S; Penta, B; Gould, R; Sakalaukus, P; Ladner, S",2013,Article,J.

342,Spatio-temporal modeling for real-time ozone forecasting,"Accurate assessment of exposure to ambient ozone concentrations is important for informing the public and pollution monitoring agencies about ozone levels that may lead to adverse health effects. A practical challenge facing the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is to provide real-time forecasting of current 8 h average ozone exposure over the entire conterminous United States. Such real-time forecasting is now provided as spatial forecast maps of current 8 h average ozone defined as the average of the previous four hours, current hour, and predictions for the next three hours. Current patterns are updated hourly throughout the day on the EPA-AIRNow web site. Our contribution is to show how we can substantially improve upon current real-time forecasting systems. We introduce a down-scaler fusion model based on first differences of real- time monitoring data and numerical model output. The model has a flexible coefficient structure with an efficient computational strategy to fit model parameters. This strategy can be viewed as hybrid in that it blends offline model fitting with online predictions followed by fast spatial interpolation to produce the desired real- time forecast maps. Model validation for the eastern US shows consequential improvement of our fully inferential approach compared with the existing implementations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

454,Forecasting crop yield using remotely sensed vegetation indices and crop phenology metrics,"We used data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in association with county-level data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop empirical models predicting maize and soybean yield in the Central United States. As part of our analysis we also tested the ability of MODIS to capture inter-annual variability in yields. Our results show that the MODIS two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) provides a better basis for predicting maize yields relative to the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of information related to crop phenology derived from MODIS significantly improved model performance within and across years. Surprisingly, using moderate spatial resolution data from the MODIS Land Cover Type product to identify agricultural areas did not degrade model results relative to using higher-spatial resolution crop-type maps developed by the USDA. Correlations between vegetation indices and yield were highest 65-75 days after greenup for maize and 80 days after greenup for soybeans. EVI2 was the best index for predicting maize yield in non-semi-arid counties (R-2 = 0.67), but the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed better in semi-arid counties (R-2 = 0.69), probably because the NDWI is sensitive to irrigation in semi-arid areas with low-density agriculture. NDVI and EVI2 performed equally well predicting soybean yield (R-2 = 0.69 and 0.70, respectively). In addition, EVI2 was best able to capture large negative anomalies in maize yield in 2005 (R-2 = 0.73). Overall, our results show that using crop phenology and a combination of EVI2 and NDWI have significant benefit for remote sensing-based maize and soybean yield models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research findings enable deep architectures training, opening a new interesting research area called deep learning. This paper presents a study of deep learning techniques applied to time-series forecasting in a real indoor temperature forecasting task, studying performance due to different hyper-parameter configurations. When using deep models, better generalization performance at test set and an over-fitting reduction has been observed.",NA,"Romeu, P; Zamora-Martinez, F; Botella-Rocamora, P; Pardo, J",2013,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,0,1,NA,,,1
338,A numerical model of birch pollen emission and dispersion in the atmosphere. Description of the emission module,"A birch pollen emission model is described and its main features are discussed. The development of the model is based on a double-threshold temperature sum model that describes the propagation of the flowering season and naturally links to the thermal time models to predict the onset and duration of flowering. For the flowering season, the emission model considers ambient humidity and precipitation rate, both of which suppress the pollen release, as well as wind speed and turbulence intensity, which promote it. These dependencies are qualitatively evaluated using the aerobiological observations. Reflecting the probabilistic character of the flowering of an individual tree in a population, the model introduces relaxation functions at the start and end of the season. The physical basis of the suggested birch pollen emission model is compared with another comprehensive emission module reported in literature. The emission model has been implemented in the SILAM dispersion modelling system, the results of which are evaluated in a companion paper.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-012-0532-z,"Sofiev, M; Siljamo, P; Ranta, H; Linkosalo, T; Jaeger, S; Rasmussen, A; Rantio-Lehtimaki, A; Severova, E; Kukkonen, J",2013,Article,Int.

27,"Forecasting of the selected features of Poaceae (R. Br.) Barnh., Artemisia L. and Ambrosia L. pollen season in Szczecin, north-western Poland, using Gumbel's distribution","Introduction and objectives. The allergenic pollen content of the atmosphere varies according to climate, biogeography and vegetation. Minimisation of the pollen allergy symptoms is related to the possibility of avoidance of large doses of the allergen. Measurements performed in Szczecin over a period of 13 years (2000-2012 inclusive) permitted prediction of theoretical maximum concentrations of pollen grains and their probability for the pollen season of Poaceae,Artemisia and Ambrosia. Moreover, the probabilities were determined of a given date as the beginning of the pollen season, the date of the maximum pollen count, Seasonal Pollen Index value and the number of days with pollen count above threshold values. Materials and methods. Aerobiological monitoring was conducted using a Hirst volumetric trap (Lanzoni VPPS). Linear trend with determination coefficient (R-2) was calculated. Model for long-term forecasting was performed by the method based on Gumbel's distribution. Results. A statistically significant negative correlation was determined between the duration of pollen season of Poaceae and Artemisia and the Seasonal Pollen Index value. Seasonal, total pollen counts of Artemisia and Ambrosia showed a strong and statistically significant decreasing tendency. On the basis of Gumbel's distribution, a model was proposed for Szczecin, allowing prediction of the probabilities of the maximum pollen count values that can appear once in e.g. 5, 10 or 100 years. Conclusions. Short pollen seasons are characterised by a higher intensity of pollination than long ones. Prediction of the maximum pollen count values, dates of the pollen season beginning, and the number of days with pollen count above the threshold, on the basis of Gumbel's distribution, is expected to lead to improvement in the prophylaxis and therapy of persons allergic to pollen.",NA,"Puc, M; Wolski, T",2013,Article,Ann.

168,Geospatial interpolation of MODIS-derived salinity and temperature in the Chesapeake Bay,"In dynamic coastal systems such as the Chesapeake Bay, limited coverage and frequency of in situ measurements often makes generalizability of regional forecasting systems difficult Satellite-derived environmental variables have the potential to address this problem, but satellite datasets suffer from incomplete coverage as well: atmospheric conditions-most notably cloud cover-lead to data gaps that significantly hinder the broad application of satellite-informed predictions. In this study, the Chesapeake Bay estuary was used as a model ""test bed"" to which we applied the power of near real-time satellite-derived observations to the issue of water quality monitoring. To use remote sensing in support of spatially complete estimates of salinity and temperature in the Bay, we tested geospatial interpolation techniques as a method for filling gaps and minimizing errors in the satellite record. These interpolated values were then compared to the output of a regional hydrodynamic model in order to assess the relative value of each method for generating inputs into various modeling applications. Results show that MODIS-derived salinity and temperature can be interpolated with acceptable accuracy in the Bay, with a mean absolute error of 1.88 psu and 0.60 degrees C. These errors differed systematically from ChesROMS errors both spatially and seasonally, with higher errors for salinity and lower errors for temperature at most sampling stations throughout the year. This suggests that the two techniques offer complementary information that can be applied to ecological monitoring systems in complex estuaries like Chesapeake Bay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

406,Forecasting potential bark beetle outbreaks based on spruce forest vitality using hyperspectral remote-sensing techniques at different scales,"The bark beetle Ups typographus L) is known for the detrimental impact it can have on Europe's mature spruce forests with bark beetle outbreaks already having devastated thousands of hectares of spruce forests in Germany. This study analysed the hypothesis that the vitality of spruce vegetation is already susceptible from factors such as climate change or emissions to a certain extent before infestation, so that the role of the subsequent bark beetle infestation is only secondary. Hyperspectral remote-sensing techniques were used to detect changes in biochemical-biophysical vegetation characteristics in the spruce forest of the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. For this study, several spectral bands, vegetation indices and specific spectral band combinations of hyperspectral HyMAP remote-sensing data with a 4 m and a 7 m ground resolution were analysed and compared in terms of their classification accuracy, generating an ID3 decision tree. The vitality classes and thus also the attack stages of the spruce vegetation could be estimated with moderate to good accuracy using hyperspectral remote-sensing data. Clear spectral differences between the class with spruce trees that were still green but with reduced vitality (possibly the first stages of green-attack) and the class with healthy spruce trees could be ascertained. The best spectral characteristics, spectral indicators and spectral derivatives related to vitality classes and thus attack stages were typically based on wavebands related to prominent chlorophyll absorption features in the VI within the spectral range of 450-890 nm. Only limited spectral information and derivatives could be found in the short-wave infrared region 1 (SWIR) within the spectral range of 1400-1800 nm, which reflects the water content of the spruce needles. The class of spruce trees that were still green but with reduced vitality (possibly the first stages of green-attack) showed a trend towards detectability and differentiation with spectral indicators and index derivatives. However, the prediction of observed effects with 64% accuracy as observed here is regarded as insufficient in forestry practises. Hyperspectral data with a ground resolution of 4 m were found to contain more information relevant to estimating the vitality class of spruce vegetation compared to hyperspectral data with a ground resolution of 7 m.

397,FLOWERING DATE OF TAXONOMIC FAMILIES PREDICTS PHENOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY TO TEMPERATURE: IMPLICATIONS FOR FORECASTING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON UNSTUDIED TAXA,"Premise of the study: Numerous long-term studies in seasonal habitats have tracked interannual variation in first flowering date (FFD) in relation to climate, documenting the effect of warming on the FFD of many species. Despite these efforts, long-term phenological observations are still lacking for many species. If we could forecast responses based on taxonomic affinity, however, then we could leverage existing data to predict the climate-related phenological shifts of many taxa not yet studied. Methods: We examined phenological time series of 1226 species occurrences (1031 unique species in 119 families) across seven sites in North America and England to determine whether family membership (or family mean FFD) predicts the sensitivity of FFD to standardized interannual changes in temperature and precipitation during seasonal periods before flowering and whether families differ significantly in the direction of their phenological shifts. Key results: Patterns observed among species within and across sites are mirrored among family means across sites; early-flowering families advance their FFD in response to warming more than late-flowering families. By contrast, we found no consistent relationships among taxa between mean FFD and sensitivity to precipitation as measured here. Conclusions: Family membership can be used to identify taxa of high and low sensitivity to temperature within the seasonal, temperate zone plant communities analyzed here. The high sensitivity of early-flowering families (and the absence of early-flowering families not sensitive to temperature) may reflect plasticity in flowering time, which may be adaptive in environments where early-season conditions are highly variable among years.",https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1200455,"Mazer, SJ; Travers, SE; Cook, BI; Davies, TJ; Bolmgren, K; Kraft, NJB; Salamin, N; Inouye, DW",2013,Article,Am.

24,Prediction Skill and Bias of Tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures in the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2,"The prediction skill and bias of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) in the retrospective forecasts of the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction were examined. The CFSv2 was initialized from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) over 1982-2010. There was a systematic cold bias in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific during summer/fall. The cold bias in the Nino-3.4 index was about -2.5 degrees C in summer/fall before 1999 but suddenly changed to -1 degrees C around 1999, related to a sudden shift in the trade winds and equatorial subsurface temperature in the CFSR.The SST anomaly (SSTA) was computed by removing model climatology for the periods 1982-98 and 1999-2010 separately. The standard deviation (STD) of forecast SSTA agreed well with that of observations in 1982-98, but in 1999-2010 it was about 200% too strong in the eastern Pacific and 50% too weak near the date line during winter/spring. The shift in STD bias was partially related to change of ENSO characteristics: central Pacific (CP) El Ninos were more frequent than eastern Pacific (EP) El Ninos after 2000. The composites analysis shows that the CFSv2 had a tendency to delay the onset phase of the EP El Ninos in the 1980s and 1990s but predicted their decay phases well. In contrast, the CFSv2 predicted the onset phase of the CP El Ninos well but prolonged their decay phase. The hit rate for both El Nino and La Nina was lower in the later period than in the early period, and the false alarm for La Nina increased appreciably from the early to the later period.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00600.1,"Xue, Y; Chen, MY; Kumar, A; Hu, ZZ; Wang, WQ",2013,Article,J.

135,Evaluation of numerical weather prediction model precipitation forecasts for short-term streamflow forecasting purpose,"The quality of precipitation forecasts from four Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models is evaluated over the Ovens catchment in Southeast Australia. Precipitation forecasts are compared with observed precipitation at point and catchment scales and at different temporal resolutions. The four models evaluated are the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS) including ACCESS-G with a 80 km resolution, ACCESS-R 37.5 km, ACCESS-A 12 km, and ACCESS-VT 5 km. The skill of the NWP precipitation forecasts varies considerably between rain gauging stations. In general, high spatial resolution (ACCESS-A and ACCESS-VT) and regional (ACCESS-R) NWP models overestimate precipitation in dry, low elevation areas and underestimate in wet, high elevation areas. The global model (ACCESS-G) consistently underestimates the precipitation at all stations and the bias increases with station elevation. The skill varies with forecast lead time and, in general, it decreases with the increasing lead time. When evaluated at finer spatial and temporal resolution (e. g. 5 km, hourly), the precipitation forecasts appear to have very little skill. There is moderate skill at short lead times when the forecasts are averaged up to daily and/or catchment scale. The precipitation forecasts fail to produce a diurnal cycle shown in observed precipitation. Significant sampling uncertainty in the skill scores suggests that more data are required to get a reliable evaluation of the forecasts. The non-smooth decay of skill with forecast lead time can be attributed to diurnal cycle in the observation and sampling uncertainty. Future work is planned to assess the benefits of using the NWP rainfall forecasts for short-term streamflow forecasting. Our findings here suggest that it is necessary to remove the systematic biases in rainfall forecasts, particularly those from low resolution models, before the rainfall forecasts can be used for streamflow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-17-1913-2013,"Shrestha, DL; Robertson, DE; Wang, QJ; Pagano, TC; Hapuarachchi, HAP",2013,Article,Hydrol.

Planning for ACCESS development commenced in 2005 and significant progress has been made subsequently.

262,Model-free forecasting outperforms the correct mechanistic model for simulated and experimental data,"Accurate predictions of species abundance remain one of the most vexing challenges in ecology. This observation is perhaps unsurprising, because population dynamics are often strongly forced and highly nonlinear. Recently, however, numerous statistical techniques have been proposed for fitting highly parameterized mechanistic models to complex time series, potentially providing the machinery necessary for generating useful predictions. Alternatively, there is a wide variety of comparatively simple model-free forecasting methods that could be used to predict abundance. Here wepose a rather conservative challenge and ask whether a correctly specified mechanistic model, fit with commonly used statistical techniques, can provide better forecasts than simple model-free methods for ecological systems with noisy nonlinear dynamics. Using four different control models and seven experimental time series of flour beetles, we found that Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for fitting mechanistic models often converged on best-fit parameterizations far different from the known parameters. As a result, the correctly specified models provided inaccurate forecasts and incorrect inferences. In contrast, a model-free method based on state-space reconstruction gave the most accurate short-term forecasts, even while using only a single time series from the multivariate system. Considering the recent push for ecosystem-based management and the increasing call for ecological predictions, our results suggest that a flexible model-free approach may be the most promising way forward.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216076110,"Perretti, CT; Munch, SB; Sugihara, G",2013,Article,Proc.

28,"Spatio-temporal infestation patterns of Ips typographus (L.) in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany","The Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany has experienced infestations of bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) since the 1980s, resulting in considerable ecological loss due to the destruction of almost 5800 ha of spruce forests. Although there have been numerous investigations on the physiology and ecology of the bark beetle, until now the spatio-temporal infestation and dispersal dynamics of the bark beetle over a longer period have still not been satisfactorily understood. The understanding of the structure and the dispersal of bark beetle infestations is however of significant importance for forest management systems in order to predict the risk of outbreaks, especially in the face of climate change. The aim of this investigation was therefore (I) to analyse and describe the long term spatio-temporal infestation patterns of I. typographus in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany on the landscape scale, (II) to conduct investigations on spatio-temporal shifts of the focal points of bark beetle infestations from 1988 to 2010 and (III) to compare the quantitative spatio-temporal infestation patterns obtained at the landscape level with the dispersal patterns of the spatially explicit agent-based simulation model (SAMBIA) for L typographus (Fahse and Heurich, 2011). The results of the study show that a shift in the infestation pattern of I. typographus from 1988 to 2010 occurs at different time intervals both undirectionally as well as directionally. Furthermore, the dispersal pattern of the bark beetle was recorded quantitatively and described extensively over a period of 23 years on the landscape scale. The quantification of the presence and dispersion pattern of I. typographus in the Bavarian Forest National Park allows us to gain a better understanding of the distribution pattern of the bark beetle on the landscape scale. In this way, both the pattern and structure of infestation patterns obtained for I. typographus serve as: (a) a basis for the criteria to improve the parameters of spatio-temporal simulation models, (b) a better understanding of the bark beetle pattern and existing processes such as disturbance patterns or damage patterns in the food web of spruces due to climate change, (c) a test for the hypotheses on the relationships between the presence of bark beetle and relevant habitat variables as well as (d) the compilation of forecast models on the dispersal of bark beetle. These predictions can help with the implementation of specific management strategies to prevent the dispersal of bark beetle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

336,Legitimising data-driven models: exemplification of a new data-driven mechanistic modelling framework,"In this paper the difficult problem of how to legitimise data-driven hydrological models is addressed using an example of a simple artificial neural network modelling problem. Many data-driven models in hydrology have been criticised for their black-box characteristics, which prohibit adequate understanding of their mechanistic behaviour and restrict their wider heuristic value. In response, presented here is a new generic data-driven mechanistic modelling framework. The framework is significant because it incorporates an evaluation of the legitimacy of a data-driven model's internal modelling mechanism as a core element in the modelling process. The framework's value is demonstrated by two simple artificial neural network river forecasting scenarios. We develop a novel adaptation of first-order partial derivative, relative sensitivity analysis to enable each model's mechanistic legitimacy to be evaluated within the framework. The results demonstrate the limitations of standard, goodness-of-fit validation procedures by highlighting how the internal mechanisms of complex models that produce the best fit scores can have lower mechanistic legitimacy than simpler counterparts whose scores are only slightly inferior. Thus, our study directly tackles one of the key debates in data-driven, hydrological modelling: is it acceptable for our ends (i.e. model fit) to justify our means (i.e. the numerical basis by which that fit is achieved)?",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-17-2827-2013,"Mount, NJ; Dawson, CW; Abrahart, RJ",2013,Article,Hydrol.

304,Pla a_1 aeroallergen immunodetection related to the airborne Platanus pollen content,"Platanus hispanica pollen is considered an important source of aeroallergens in many Southern European cities. This tree is frequently used in urban green spaces as ornamental specie. The flowering period is greatly influenced by the meteorological conditions, which directly affect its allergenic load in the atmosphere. The purpose of this study is to develop equations to predict the Platanus allergy risk periods as a function of the airborne pollen, the allergen concentration and the main meteorological parameters. The study was conducted by means two volumetric pollen samplers; a Lanzoni VPPS 2000 for the Platanus pollen sampling and a Burkard multivial Cyclone Sampler to collect the aeroallergen particles (Pla a_1). In addiction the Dot-Blot and the Raman spectroscopy methods were used to corroborate the results. The Pla a_l protein is recorded in the atmosphere after the presence of the Platanus pollen, which extend the Platanus pollen allergy risk periods. The Platanus pollen and the Pla al allergens concentration are associated with statistical significant variations of some meteorological variables: in a positive way with the mean and maximum temperature whereas the sign of the correlation coefficient is negative with the relative humidity. The lineal regression equation elaborated in order to forecast the Platanus pollen content in the air explain the 64.5% of variance of the pollen presence in the environment, whereas the lineal regression equation elaborated in order to forecast the aeroallergen a 54.1% of the Pla a_1 presence variance. The combination of pollen count and the allergen quantification must be assessed in the epidemiologic study of allergic respiratory diseases to prevent the allergy risk periods.

319,Hierarchical Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Conway-Maxwell Poisson Models with Dynamic Dispersion,"Modeling spatio-temporal count processes is often a challenging endeavor. That is, in many real-world applications the complexity and high-dimensionality of the data and/or process do not allow for routine model specification. For example, spatio-temporal count data often exhibit temporally varying over/underdispersion within the spatial domain. In order to accommodate such structure, while quantifying different sources of uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) model with dynamic dispersion. Motivated by the problem of predicting migratory bird settling patterns, we propose a threshold vector-autoregressive model for the CMP intensity parameter that allows for regime switching based on climate conditions. Additionally, to reduce the inherent high-dimensionality of the underlying process, we consider nonlinear dimension reduction through kernel principal component analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through out-of-sample one-year-ahead prediction of waterfowl migratory patterns across the United States and Canada. The proposed approach is of independent interest and illustrates the potential benefits of dynamic dispersion in terms of superior forecasting.

52,Assimilation of MODIS-LAI into the WOFOST model for forecasting regional winter wheat yield,"Crop growth models have been applied successfully in forecasting crop yield at a local scale, while satellite remote sensing has the advantage of retrieving regional crop parameters. The new assimilation method of integrating the crop growth model with remote sensing has presented great potential in regional crop yield assessment. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) data product was assimilated into the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop growth model. Using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) global sensitivity analysis approach, several local and regional crop parameters were identified to be recalibrated. The Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) optimization algorithm was used to estimate the emergence date, initial biomass and initial available soil water by minimizing the differences between the corrected MODIS-LAI and simulated LAI. Results indicated that the accuracy of water-limited crop yield was improved significantly after the assimilation. The root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 983 kg/ha to 474 kg/ha and 667 kg/ha respectively in two different optimization schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

367,Reducing uncertainty and risk through forest management planning in British Columbia,"The Alex Fraser Research Forest is 10,000 ha of provincial land managed for research and teaching by the University of British Columbia in central British Columbia. Experience shows us that weather is already a driving influence in forest management as extreme-weather events cause substantial damage. Biotic and abiotic disturbances create significant uncertainty for managers, and present a significant risk of loss to the growing stock. Forecasts of climate change indicate increasing average temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. These forecasts also suggest more extreme-weather events. Changing weather patterns mean changing interactions between forests and disturbance agents, likely resulting in unprecedented levels of damage. Research forest managers have developed an approach to managing this uncertainty and risk through forest management planning. If climate change will lead to more extreme weather, it is expected that adapting to climate change will equate to managing risk. A retrospective examination of the response to the mountain pine beetle outbreak (1991-2005) has enabled us to document our approach to managing the risk of damage and loss. Forest management planning provides a framework to establish priorities, set objectives and devise strategies to maintain the values that are important on research forests as they adapt to climate change.

203,Prediction of seasonal climate-induced variations in global food production,"Consumers, including the poor in many countries, are increasingly dependent on food imports(1) and are thus exposed to variations in yields, production and export prices in the major food-producing regions of the world. National governments and commercial entities are therefore paying increased attention to the cropping forecasts of important food-exporting countries as well as to their own domestic food production. Given the increased volatility of food markets and the rising incidence of climatic extremes affecting food production, food price spikes may increase in prevalence in future years(2-4). Here we present a global assessment of the reliability of crop failure hindcasts for major crops at two lead times derived by linking ensemble seasonal climatic forecasts with statistical crop models. We found that moderate-to-marked yield loss over a substantial percentage (26-33%) of the harvested area of these crops is reliably predictable if climatic forecasts are near perfect. However, only rice and wheat production are reliably predictable at three months before the harvest using within-season hindcasts. The reliabilities of estimates varied substantially by crop-rice and wheat yields were the most predictable, followed by soybean and maize. The reasons for variation in the reliability of the estimates included the differences in crop sensitivity to the climate and the technology used by the crop-producing regions. Our findings reveal that the use of seasonal climatic forecasts to predict crop failures will be useful for monitoring global food production and will encourage the adaptation of food systems to climatic extremes.",https://doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE1945,"Iizumi, T; Sakuma, H; Yokozawa, M; Luo, JJ; Challinor, AJ; Brown, ME; Sakurai, G; Yamagata, T",2013,Article,Nat.

354,Constructed Analogs and Linear Regression,"The constructed analog procedure produces a statistical forecast that is a linear combination of past predictand values. The weights used to form the linear combination depend on the current predictor value and are chosen so that the linear combination of past predictor values approximates the current predictor value. The properties of the constructed analog method have previously been described as being distinct from those of linear regression. However, here the authors show that standard implementations of the constructed analog method give forecasts that are identical to linear regression forecasts. A consequence of this equivalence is that constructed analog forecasts based on many predictors tend to suffer from overfitting just as in linear regression. Differences between linear regression and constructed analog forecasts only result from implementation choices, especially ones related to the preparation and truncation of data. Two particular constructed analog implementations are shown to correspond to principal component regression and ridge regression. The equality of linear regression and constructed analog forecasts is illustrated in a Nino-3.4 prediction example, which also shows that increasing the number of predictors results in low-skill, high-variance forecasts, even at long leads, behavior typical of overfitting. Alternative definitions of the analog weights lead naturally to nonlinear extensions of linear regression such as local linear regression.",https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-12-00223.1,"Tippett, MK; Delsole, T",2013,Article,Mon.

194,Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction of the Asian Summer Monsoon in the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2,"The NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) is an important source of information for seasonal climate prediction in many Asian countries affected by monsoon climate. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the prediction of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) by the new CFS version 2 (CFSv2) using the hindcast for 1983-2010, focusing on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. Many ASM features are well predicted by the CFSv2, including heavy monsoon rainfall centers, large-scale monsoon circulation patterns, and monsoon onset and retreat features. Several commonly used dynamical monsoon indices and their associated precipitation and circulation patterns can be predicted several months in advance. The CFSv2 has better skill in predicting the Southeast Asian monsoon than predicting the South Asian monsoon. Compared to CFS version 1 (CFSv1), the CFSv2 has increased skill in predicting large-scale monsoon circulation and precipitation features but decreased skill for the South Asian monsoon, although some biases in the CFSv1 still exist in the CFSv2, especially the weaker-than-observed western Pacific subtropical high and the exaggerated strong link of the ASM to ENSO. Comparison of CFSv2 hindcast with output from Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) simulations indicates that exclusion of ocean-atmosphere coupling leads to a weaker ASM. Compared to AMIP, both hindcast and CMIP show a more realistic annual cycle of precipitation, and the interannual variability of the ASM is better in hindcast. However, CMIP does not show any advantage in depicting the processes associated with the interannual variability of major dynamical monsoon indices compared to AMIP.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00437.1,"Jiang, XW; Yang, S; Li, YQ; Kumar, A; Liu, XW; Zuo, ZY; Jha, B",2013,Article,J.

132,Prediction of global patterns of dominant quasi-biweekly oscillation by the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2,"Daily output from the hindcasts by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) is analyzed to understand the skill of forecasting atmospheric variability on quasi-biweekly (QBW) time scale. Eight dominant quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) modes identified by the extended empirical orthogonal function analysis are focused. In the CFSv2, QBW variability exhibits a significant weakening tendency with lead time for all seasons. For most QBWO modes, the variance drops to only 50 % of the initial value at lead time of 11-15 days. QBW variability has better prediction skill in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere. Skillful forecast can reach about 10-15 days for most modes but those in the winter hemisphere have better forecast skills. Among the eight QBWO modes, the North Pacific mode and the South Pacific (SP) mode have the highest forecast skills while the Asia-Pacific mode and the Central American mode have the lowest skills. For the Asia-Pacific and Central American modes, the forecasted QBWO phase shows an obvious eastward shift with increase in lead time compared to observations, indicating a smaller propagating speed. However, the predicted feature for the SP mode is more realistic. Air-sea coupling on the QBW time scale is perhaps responsible for the different prediction skills for different QBWO modes. In addition, most QBWO modes have better forecasting skills in El Nio years than in La Nia years. Different dynamical mechanisms for various QBWO modes may be partially responsible for the differences in prediction skill among different QBWO modes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1877-7,"Jia, XL; Yang, S; Li, X; Liu, YY; Wang, H; Liu, XW; Weaver, S",2013,Article,Clim.

344,Nonlinear and nonparametric modeling approaches for probabilistic forecasting of the US gross national product,"Numerous time series models are available for forecasting economic output. Autoregressive models were initially applied to US gross national product (GNP), and have been extended to nonlinear structures, such as the self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) models. We show that while these nonlinear models fit the in-sample data better than linear models, the out-of-sample forecast performance of extremely simple methods, such as the unconditional mean is competitive compared with both previously published linear and nonlinear models for GNP time series. Motivated by Occam's razor and the forecasting competitiveness of the unconditional mean, we seek parsimonious models which are based on simple assumptions, incorporate few parameters, and can generate accurate forecasts. We propose nonlinear and nonparametric models based on nearest neighbor and kernel regression by forming a state-space of time delayed GNP observations. The rationale of the proposed methodology lies in identification of local regions of state-space known as nearest neighbor sub-spaces, whereby we utilize future trajectories of the neighboring states and weight them using a double kernel estimator to generate density forecasts. The models proposed in this work incorporate only one or two parameters, and the model estimation framework relies on optimizing the performance of in-sample density forecasts. The proposed modeling approach does not require prior assumptions regarding the form of the error distribution, and can provide transition between regimes of growth and contraction. We compare the forecasts from proposed models with classical time series models for GNP and a range of benchmarks, and validate our results on two post-war GNP time series using different performance scores, such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). We find that proposed models consistently outperformed previously published models for point and density forecasts of GNP at varying horizons.",https://doi.org/10.1515/snde-2012-0029,"Arora, S; Little, MA; McSharry, PE",2013,Article,Stud.

462,"THE USE OF REMOTE SENSING DATA FOR EPIDEMIC (SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL) RISK ASSESSMENT IN COASTAL REGIONS (CASE STUDY: CHOLERA OUTBREAK IN MARIUPOL, 2011)","We consider the use of satellite observations and meteorological data for the analysis of epidemic and socio-ecological risks. We propose an approach to the assessment of the integrated risk which is based on the estimation of probabilities of the epidemic genesis and spread. Our procedure for the analysis of the risk of causative agent penetration to an ecosystem is based on the modified Pareto equation with taking into account of precipitation variations and the water absorption capability of local ecosystems. To increase the forecasting efficiency, a procedure for the calculation of most expected distributions of investigated values (instead of mean distributions) is proposed. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDVI and NDWI) arc used as the remote indicators. Some approaches to the analysis of development risk for the epidemic in the land and sea ecosystems are proposed. A problem oriented advanced method of spatial-temporal regularization of multispectral satellite observations (including spectral reflectance indexes analysis) is given. Corresponding values of scale factors, weight coefficients, and fitness functions are calculated for used satellite sensors and regional data. Using the algorithms proposed, the separate and integrated probabilities of the epidemic genesis and spread in the region under study are calculated for 2009-2012.

401,In search of greener pastures: Using satellite images to predict the effects of environmental change on zebra migration,"Historically, ungulate migrations occurred in most grassland and boreal woodland ecosystems, but many have been lost due to increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. With the rate of environmental change increasing, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on a new urgency. Understanding the cues that drive long-distance animal movements is critical to predicting the fate of migrations under different environmental change scenarios and how large migratory herbivores will respond to increasing resource heterogeneity and anthropogenic influences. We used an individual-based modeling approach to investigate the influence of environmental conditions, monitored using satellite data, on departure date and movement speed of migrating zebras in Botswana. Daily zebra movements between dry and rainy season ranges were annotated with coincident observations of precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data set and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). An array of increasingly complex movement models representing alternative hypotheses regarding the environmental cues and controls for movement was parameterized and tested. The best and most justified model predicted daily zebra movement as two linear functions of precipitation rate and NDVI and included a modeled departure date as a function of cumulative precipitation. The model was highly successful at replicating both the timing and pace of seven actual migrations observed using GPS telemetry (R-2=0.914). It shows how zebras rapidly adjust their movement to changing environmental conditions during migration and are able to reverse migration to avoid adverse conditions or exploit renewed resource availability, a nomadic behavior which should lend them a degree of resilience to climate and environmental change. Our results demonstrate how competing individual-based migration models, informed by freely available satellite data, can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence for multiple hypotheses regarding the use of environmental cues in animal movement. This modeling framework can be applied to quantify how animals adapt the timing and pace of their movements to prevailing environmental conditions and to forecast migrations in near real time or under alternative environmental scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrg.20096,"Bartlam-Brooks, HLA; Beck, PSA; Bohrer, G; Harris, S",2013,Article,J.

271,On improving the communication between models and data,"The potential for model-data synthesis is growing in importance as we enter an era of 'big data', greater connectivity and faster computation. Realizing this potential requires that the research community broaden its perspective about how and why they interact with models. Models can be viewed as scaffolds that allow data at different scales to inform each other through our understanding of underlying processes. Perceptions of relevance, accessibility and informatics are presented as the primary barriers to broader adoption of models by the community, while an inability to fully utilize the breadth of expertise and data from the community is a primary barrier to model improvement. Overall, we promote a community-based paradigm to model-data synthesis and highlight some of the tools and techniques that facilitate this approach. Scientific workflows address critical informatics issues in transparency, repeatability and automation, while intuitive, flexible web-based interfaces make running and visualizing models more accessible. Bayesian statistics provides powerful tools for assimilating a diversity of data types and for the analysis of uncertainty. Uncertainty analyses enable new measurements to target those processes most limiting our predictive ability. Moving forward, tools for information management and data assimilation need to be improved and made more accessible.",https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.12043,"Dietze, MC; Lebauer, DS; Kooper, R",2013,Article,Plant Cell Environ.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA

323,Predicting climate effects on Pacific sardine,"For many marine species and habitats, climate change and overfishing present a double threat. To manage marine resources effectively, it is necessary to adapt management to changes in the physical environment. Simple relationships between environmental conditions and fish abundance have long been used in both fisheries and fishery management. In many cases, however, physical, biological, and human variables feed back on each other. For these systems, associations between variables can change as the system evolves in time. This can obscure relationships between population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes. Here we present a methodology for identifying physical forcing variables based on nonlinear forecasting and show how the method provides a predictive understanding of the influence of physical forcing on Pacific sardine.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215506110,"Deyle, ER; Fogarty, M; Hsieh, CH; Kaufman, L; MacCall, AD; Munch, SB; Perretti, CT; Ye, H; Sugihara, G",2013,Article,Proc.

248,Modeling the Potential Spread of the Recently Identified Non-Native Panther Grouper (Chromileptes altivelis) in the Atlantic Using a Cellular Automaton Approach,"The Indo-pacific panther grouper (Chromileptes altiveli) is a predatory fish species and popular imported aquarium fish in the United States which has been recently documented residing in western Atlantic waters. To date, the most successful marine invasive species in the Atlantic is the lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles), which, as for the panther grouper, is assumed to have been introduced to the wild through aquarium releases. However, unlike lionfish, the panther grouper is not yet thought to have an established breeding population in the Atlantic. Using a proven modeling technique developed to track the lionfish invasion, presented is the first known estimation of the potential spread of panther grouper in the Atlantic. The employed cellular automaton-based computer model examines the life history of the subject species including fecundity, mortality, and reproductive potential and combines this with habitat preferences and physical oceanic parameters to forecast the distribution and periodicity of spread of this potential new invasive species. Simulations were examined for origination points within one degree of capture locations of panther grouper from the United States Geological Survey Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database to eliminate introduction location bias, and two detailed case studies were scrutinized. The model indicates three primary locations where settlement is likely given the inputs and limits of the model; Jupiter Florida/Vero Beach, the Cape Hatteras Tropical Limit/Myrtle Beach South Carolina, and Florida Keys/Ten Thousand Islands locations. Of these locations, Jupiter Florida/Vero Beach has the highest settlement rate in the model and is indicated as the area in which the panther grouper is most likely to become established. This insight is valuable if attempts are to be made to halt this potential marine invasive species.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073023,"Johnston, MW; Purkis, SJ",2013,Article,PLoS One,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
345,Inductive reasoning and forecasting of population dynamics of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in three sub-tropical reservoirs by evolutionary computation,"Seven-day-ahead forecasting models of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in three warm-monomictic and mesotrophic reservoirs in south-east Queensland have been developed by means of water quality data from 1999 to 2010 and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. Resulting models using all measured variables as inputs as well as models using electronically measurable variables only as inputs forecasted accurately timing of overgrowth of C raciborskii and matched well high and low magnitudes of observed bloom events with 0.45 <= r(2) > 0.61 and 0.4 <= r(2) > 0.57, respectively. The models also revealed relationships and thresholds triggering bloom events that provide valuable information on synergism between water quality conditions and population dynamics of C. raciborskii. Best performing models based on using all measured variables as inputs indicated electrical conductivity (EC) within the range of 206-280 mS m(-1) as threshold above which fast growth and high abundances of C raciborskii have been observed for the three lakes. Best models based on electronically measurable variables for the Lakes Wivenhoe and Somerset indicated a water temperature (WT) range of 25.5-32.7 degrees C within which fast growth and high abundances of C raciborskii can be expected. By contrast the model for Lake Samsonvale highlighted a turbidity (TURB) level of 4.8 NTU as indicator for mass developments of C raciborskii. Experiments with online measured water quality data of the Lake Wivenhoe from 2007 to 2010 resulted in predictive models with 0.61 <= r(2) > 0.65 whereby again similar levels of EC and WT have been discovered as thresholds for outgrowth of C raciborskii. The highest validity of r(2) = 0.75 for an in situ data-based model has been achieved after considering time lags for EC by 7 days and dissolved oxygen by 1 day. These time lags have been discovered by a systematic screening of all possible combinations of time lags between 0 and 10 days for all electronically measurable variables. The so-developed model performs seven-day-ahead forecasts and is currently implemented and tested for early warning of C raciborskii blooms in the Wivenhoe reservoir. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

350,Models for identifying significant environmental factors associated with cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and for predicting cyanobacterial blooms,"Compared with microscopic indices such as biomass, inverted satellite images can reflect cyanobacterial blooms from a macroscopic perspective, can provide planar information for blooms, and can more definitely reflect the occurrence of visible cyanobacterial blooms. We therefore adopted inverted images (from MODIS imagery) to judge whether cyanobacterial blooms had occurred in a water area at a given-time. We constructed two probit models for identifying significant environmental factors related to cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and for short-term forecasts of bloom occurrence. The models used the index of cyanobacterial bloom occurrence as the dependent variable and the predicted variable, respectively, and used three categories (water quality, hydrology, and weather) of monitoring variables as the independent variables (or predictive variables). We used the Hill Dagong water area of Lake Tai in China as a case study of the new methods. The results produced by the identification model are consistent with the general conclusions in this research field indicating the validity of the model. The mean relative error of the forecast model is 13.5%, which is close to or lower than that of two previous models. Compared with the previous models, our forecast model also has advantages in terms of spatial and temporal precision. The new models have both practical applicability and the ability to be generalized and can, therefore, be easily adapted for the prevention, control, and prediction of cyanobacterial blooms in other bodies of water.

99,"Ambrosia pollen in Tulsa, Oklahoma: aerobiology, trends, and forecasting model development","Background: Ambrosia pollen is an important aeroallergen in North America; the ability to predict daily pollen levels may provide an important benefit for sensitive individuals. Objective: To analyze the long-term Ambrosia pollen counts and develop a forecasting model to predict the next day's pollen concentration. Methods: Airborne pollen has been collected since December 1986 with a Burkard spore trap at the University of Tulsa. Summary statistics and season metrics were calculated for the 27 years of data. Concentration and previous-day meteorologic data from 1987 to 2011 were used to develop a multiple regression model to predict pollen levels for the following day. Model output was compared to 2012 and 2013 ragweed pollen data. Results: The Tulsa ragweed season extends from the middle of August to late October. The mean start date is August 22, the mean peak date is September 10, and the mean end date is October 20. The mean cumulative season total is 11,599 pollen/m(3), and the mean daily concentration is 197 pollen/m(3). Previous-day meteorologic and phenologic data were positively related to pollen concentration (P < .001). Precipitation was modeled as a dichotomous variable. The final model included minimum temperature, dichotomous precipitation, dew point, and phenology variable (R = 0.7146, P < .001). Analysis of the model's accuracy revealed that the model was highly representative of the 2012 and 2013 seasons (R = 0.680, P < .001). Conclusion: Multiple regression models may be useful in explaining the variability of Ambrosia pollen levels. Further testing of the modeling parameters in different geographical areas is needed.

369,Modeling and forecasting the distribution of Vibrio vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay,"AimTo construct statistical models to predict the presence, abundance and potential virulence of Vibrio vulnificus in surface waters of Chesapeake Bay for implementation in ecological forecasting systems. Methods and ResultsWe evaluated and applied previously published qPCR assays to water samples (n=1636) collected from Chesapeake Bay from 2007-2010 in conjunction with State water quality monitoring programmes. A variety of statistical techniques were used in concert to identify water quality parameters associated with V.vulnificus presence, abundance and virulence markers in the interest of developing strong predictive models for use in regional oceanographic modeling systems. A suite of models are provided to represent the best model fit and alternatives using environmental variables that allow them to be put to immediate use in current ecological forecasting efforts. ConclusionsEnvironmental parameters such as temperature, salinity and turbidity are capable of accurately predicting abundance and distribution of V.vulnificus in Chesapeake Bay. Forcing these empirical models with output from ocean modeling systems allows for spatially explicit forecasts for up to 48h in the future.

138,Short-term forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration using the Hargreaves-Samani model and temperature forecasts,"Accurate daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) forecasting is necessary for real-time irrigation forecasting. We proposed a method for short-term forecasting of ET0 using the locally calibrated Hargreaves-Samani model and temperature forecasts. Daily meteorological data from four stations in China for the period 2001-2013 were collected to calibrate and validate the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model against the Penman-Monteith (PM) model, and the temperature forecasts for a 7-day horizon in 2012-2013 were collected and entered into the calibrated HS model to forecast the ET0. The proposed method was tested through comparisons between ET0 forecasts and ET0 calculated from observed meteorological data and the PM model. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.94, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within +/- 2 C) ranged from 60.48% to 76.29% and the accuracy of the maximum temperature forecast ranged from 50.18% to 62.94%. The accuracy of the ET0 forecast (error within +/- 1.5 mm day(-1)) ranged from 77.43% to 90.81%, the average values of the mean absolute error ranged from 0.64 to 1.02 mm day(-1), the average values of the root mean square error ranged from 0.87 to 1.36 mm day(-1), and the average values of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.64 to 0.86. The sources of errors were the error in the temperature forecasts and the fact that the effects of wind speed and relative humidity were not considered in the HS model. The applications illustrated that the proposed method could provide daily ET0 forecasts with a certain degree of accuracy for real-time irrigation forecasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

88,An assessment of pre- and within-season remotely sensed variables for forecasting corn and soybean yields in the United States,"Four timely and broadly available remotely sensed datasets were assessed for inclusion into county-level corn and soybean yield forecasting efforts focused on the Corn Belt region of the central United States (US). Those datasets were the (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as derived from the Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), (2) daytime and (3) nighttime land surface temperature (LST) as derived from Aqua satellite's MODIS, and (4) precipitation from the National Weather Service (NWS) Nexrad-based gridded data product. The originating MODIS data utilized were the globally produced 8-day, clear sky composited science products (MOD09Q1 and MYD11A2), while the US-wide NWS data were manipulated to mesh with the MODIS imagery both spatially and temporally by regridding and summing the otherwise daily measurements. The crop growing seasons of 2006-2011 were analyzed with each year bounded by 32 8-day periods from mid-February through late October. Land cover classifications known as the Cropland Data Layer as produced annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were used to isolate the input dataset pixels as to corn and soybeans for each of the corresponding years. The relevant pixels were then averaged by crop and time period to produce a county-level estimate of NDVI, the LSTs, and precipitation. They in turn were related to official annual NASS county level yield statistics. For the Corn Belt region as a whole, both corn and soybean yields were found to be positively correlated with NDVI in the middle of the summer and negatively correlated to daytime LST at that same time. Nighttime LST and precipitation showed no correlations to yield, regardless of the time prior or during the growing season. There was also slight suggestion of low NDVI and high daytime LST in the spring being positively related to final yields, again for both crops. Taking only NDVI and daytime LST as inputs from the 2006-2011 dataset, regression tree-based models were built and county-level, within-sample coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.93 were found for both crops. Limiting the models by systematically removing late season data showed the model performance to remain strong even at mid-season and still viable even earlier. Finally, the derived models were used to predict out-of-sample for the 2012 season, which ended up having an anomalous drought Yet, the county-level results compared reasonably well against official statistics with R-2 = 0.77 for corn and 0.71 for soybeans. The root-mean-square errors were 1.26 and 0.42 metric tons per hectare, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

151,The Estimation of Regional Crop Yield Using Ensemble-Based Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation,"To improve crop model performance for regional crop yield estimates, a new four-dimensional variational algorithm (POD4DVar) merging the Monte Carlo and proper orthogonal decomposition techniques was introduced to develop a data assimilation strategy using the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat model. Two winter wheat yield estimation procedures were conducted on a field plot and regional scale to test the feasibility and potential of the POD4DVar-based strategy. Winter wheat yield forecasts for the field plots showed a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.73, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 319 kg/ha, and a relative error (RE) of 3.49%. An acceptable yield at the regional scale was estimated with an R-2 of 0.997, RMSE of 7346 tons, and RE of 3.81%. The POD4DVar-based strategy was more accurate and efficient than the EnKF-based strategy. In addition to crop yield, other critical crop variables such as the biomass, harvest index, evapotranspiration, and soil organic carbon may also be estimated. The present study thus introduces a promising approach for operationally monitoring regional crop growth and predicting yield. Successful application of this assimilation model at regional scales must focus on uncertainties derived from the crop model, model inputs, data assimilation algorithm, and assimilated observations.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs6042664,"Jiang, ZW; Chen, ZX; Chen, J; Ren, JQ; Li, ZN; Sun, L",2014,Article,Remote Sens.,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
42,Statistical approach to the analysis of olive long-term pollen season trends in southern Spain,"Analysis of long-term airborne pollen counts makes it possible not only to chart pollen-season trends but also to track changing patterns in flowering phenology. Changes in higher plant response over a long interval are considered among the most valuable bioindicators of climate change impact. Phenological-trend models can also provide information regarding crop production and pollen-allergen emission. The interest of this information makes essential the election of the statistical analysis for time series study. We analysed trends and variations in the olive flowering season over a 30-year period (1982-2011) in southern Europe (Cordoba, Spain), focussing on: annual Pollen Index (PI); Pollen Season Start (PSS), Peak Date (PD), Pollen Season End (PSE) and Pollen Season Duration (PSD). Apart from the traditional Linear Regression analysis, a Seasonal-Trend Decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) and an ARIMA model were performed. Linear regression results indicated a trend toward delayed PSE and earlier PSS and PD, probably influenced by the rise in temperature. These changes are provoking longer flowering periods in the study area. The use of the STL technique provided a clearer picture of phenological behaviour. Data decomposition on pollination dynamics enabled the trend toward an alternate beating cycle to be distinguished from the influence of other stochastic fluctuations. Results pointed to show a rising trend in pollen production. With a view toward forecasting future phenological trends, ARIMA models were constructed to predict PSD, PSS and PI until 2016. Projections displayed a better goodness of fit than those derived from linear regression. Findings suggest that olive reproductive cycle is changing considerably over the last 30 years due to climate change. Further conclusions are that STL improves the effectiveness of traditional linear regression in trend analysis, and ARIMA models can provide reliable trend projections for future years taking into account the internal fluctuations in time series.

145,An integrated catchment-coastal modelling system for real-time water quality forecasts,"This paper presents a new marine water quality forecasting system for real-time and short-term predictions. The forecasting system comprises an integrated catchment-coastal model and a database management system. The integrated model is validated in an Irish catchment-coastal system using hydrodynamic and water quality data. The forecasting system was then used to provide short-term and real-time forecasts of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Intestinal Enterococci concentrations (IE) in the near-shore coastal waters of Bray, Ireland. Two hind-cast scenarios were simulated: 5F in which predictions were based on rainfall forecasts only; and I-5F where forecasts of 5F were improved by incorporating real-time data. Results indicate that predictions of E. coli of scenario I-5F are improved. Also predicted IE concentrations by Scenario 5F were comparably higher than the I-5F predications, but due to the wide scatter of observed IE concentrations, the superiority of one scenario over the second could not be definitively determined.

355,Complex dynamics may limit prediction in marine fisheries,"Complex nonlinear dynamics in marine fisheries create challenges for prediction and management, yet the extent to which they occur in fisheries is not well known. Using nonlinear forecasting models, we analysed over 200 time series of survey abundance and landings from two distinct ecosystems for patterns of dynamic complexity (dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics) and predictability. Differences in system dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics were associated with time series that reflected human intervention via fishing effort, implying the coupling between human and natural systems generated dynamics distinct from those detected in the natural resource subsystem alone. Estimated dimensionality was highest for landings and higher in abundance indices of unfished species than fished species. Fished species were more likely to display nonlinear dynamics than unfished species, and landings were significantly less predictable than abundance indices. Results were robust to variation in life history characteristics. Dynamics were predictable over a 1-year time horizon in seventy percent of time series, but predictability declined exponentially over a 5-year horizon. The ability to make predictions in fisheries systems is therefore extremely limited. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-system comparative study, and the first at the scale of individual species, to analyse empirically the dynamic complexity observed in fisheries data and to quantify predictability broadly. We outline one application of shortterm forecasts to a precautionary approach to fisheries management that could improve how uncertainty and forecast error are incorporated into assessment through catch limit buffers.",https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12037,"Glaser, SM; Fogarty, MJ; Liu, H; Altman, I; Hsieh, CH; Kaufman, L; MacCall, AD; Rosenberg, AA; Ye, H; Sugihara, G",2014,Article,Fish.

295,A Comparison of Three Approaches to Predict Phytoplankton Biomass in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu,"Algal blooms have caused severe problems in Lake Taihu, China. Early warning of phytoplankton accumulation can support decision-making against harmful algal bloom events. To investigate the performance of different models in forecasting high phytoplankton biomass, we developed a mechanistic, a regression and three artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict short-term (3 days) changes of phytoplankton biomass (expressed as chlorophyll-a concentration) in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu. We determined the input variables of the ANN models with a sensitivity analysis, and optimized their parameters with a trial-and-error approach. The sensitivity analysis revealed the effects of the input variables on phytoplankton biomass. To calibrate and validate the models, we collected two data sets of Lake Taihu in 2009: hourly-averaged data collected by an automatic monitoring system and field data with a sampling interval of twice a week. Although the sensitivity analysis results vary among the five models, there is a general consensus that phytoplankton changes are significantly affected by water temperature in Gonghu Bay. The ANN models obtained good model fit indicating their practical values in predicting non-linear phytoplankton dynamics for water management purpose. The mechanistic model predicted the phytoplanIcton distribution dynamically and described the variable interactions explicitly. The regression model is characterized by its easy development. This comparison study assists the modelers in selecting an approximate model for their specific purposes.",https://doi.org/10.3808/jei.201400258,"Huang, JC; Gao, JF; Mooij, WM; Hormann, G; Fohrer, N",2014,Article,J.

45,Application of Crop Model Data Assimilation With a Particle Filter for Estimating Regional Winter Wheat Yields,"To improve the performance of cropmodels for regional crop yield estimates, a particle filter (PF) was introduced to develop a data assimilation strategy using the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheatmodel. Two experiments involving winter wheat yield estimations were conducted at a field plot and on a regional scale to test the feasibility of the PF-based data assimilation strategy and to analyze the effects of the PF parameters and spatiotemporal scales of assimilating observations on the performance of the crop model data assimilation. The significant improvements in the yield estimation suggest that PF-based crop model data assimilation is feasible. Winter wheat yields from the field plots were forecasted with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.87, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 251 kg/ha, and a relative error (RE) of 2.95%. An acceptable yield at the county scale was estimated with a R-2 of 0.998, a RMSE of 9734 t, and a RE of 4.29%. The optimal yield estimates may be highly dependent on the reasonable spatiotemporal resolution of assimilating observations. A configuration using a particle size of 50, LAI maps with a moderate spatial resolution (e.g., 1 km), and an assimilation interval of 20 d results in a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy and effectiveness in regional applications.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2316012,"Jiang, ZW; Chen, ZX; Chen, J; Liu, J; Ren, JQ; Li, ZN; Sun, L; Li, H",2014,Article,IEEE J.

143,Fisheries management under climate and environmental uncertainty: control rules and performance simulation,"The ability of management strategies to achieve the fishery management goals are impacted by environmental variation and, therefore, also by global climate change. Management strategies can be modified to use environmental data using the ""dynamic B-0"" concept, and changing the set of years used to define biomass reference points. Two approaches have been developed to apply management strategy evaluation to evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the performance of management strategies. The ""mechanistic approach"" estimates the relationship between the environment and elements of the population dynamics of the fished species and makes predictions for population trends using the outputs from global climate models. In contrast, the ""empirical approach"" examines possible broad scenarios without explicitly identifying mechanisms. Many reviewed studies have found that modifying management strategies to include environmental factors does not improve the ability to achieve management goals much, if at all, and only if the manner in which these factors drive the system is well known. As such, until the skill of stock projection models improves, it seems more appropriate to consider the implications of plausible broad forecasts related to how biological parameters may change in the future as a way to assess the robustness of management strategies, rather than attempting specific predictions per se.",https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fst057,"Punt, AE; A'mar, T; Bond, NA; Butterworth, DS; de Moor, CL; Oliveira, JAA; Haltuch, MA; Hollowed, AB; Szuwalski, C",2014,Article,ICES J.

377,A review of data assimilation of crop growth simulation based on remote sensing information,"It is of great strategic importance of agricultural sustainable development for obtaining in timely the agricultural information, such as crop growing and yield. Data assimilation of remote sensing based on crop growth simulation becomes an effective means of monitoring regional agriculture information, which provides significant advantages in terms of economic cost, effectiveness, precision and suitability on regional scales. Data assimilation based crop growth process models can be defined as the methodology of improving process and precision of simulation which integrates simulated forecast with multi-source observation in the framework of dynamic models. According to mathematic principles of integrating model forecast with observation, three approaches of assimilating remote sensing information into crop models are concluded in this review, such as forcing, calibration and updating. Some critical issues and trends in the operation system of remote sensing data assimilation based on crop models on regional or global scales has been discussed, such as remotely sensed observation, uncertainty in assimilating process, data assimilation schemes. It is the significant and valuable research work for data assimilation of crop growth simulation based on remote sensing information.

286,An EOF-Based Algorithm to Estimate Chlorophyll a Concentrations in Taihu Lake from MODIS Land-Band Measurements: Implications for Near Real-Time Applications and Forecasting Models,"For near real-time water applications, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua are currently the only satellite instruments that can provide well-calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data over the global aquatic environments. However, TOA radiance data in the MODIS ocean bands over turbid atmosphere in east China often saturate, leaving only four land bands to use. In this study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been developed and validated to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla, mu g/L) in surface waters of Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China. The EOF approach analyzed the spectral variance of normalized Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) data at 469, 555, 645, and 859 nm, and subsequently related that variance to Chla using 28 concurrent MODIS and field measurements. This empirical algorithm was then validated using another 30 independent concurrent MODIS and field measurements. Image analysis and radiative transfer simulations indicated that the algorithm appeared to be tolerant to aerosol perturbations, with unbiased RMS uncertainties of <80% for Chla ranging between 3 and 100 mu g/L. Application of the algorithm to a total of 853 MODIS images between 2000 and 2013 under cloud-free conditions revealed spatial distribution patterns and seasonal changes that are consistent to previous findings based on floating algae mats. The current study can provide additional quantitative estimates of Chla that can be assimilated in an existing forecast model, which showed improved performance over the use of a previous Chla algorithm. However, the empirical nature, relatively large uncertainties, and limited number of spectral bands all point to the need of further improvement in data availability and accuracy with future satellite sensors.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs61110694,"Qi, L; Hu, CM; Duan, HT; Barnes, BB; Ma, RH",2014,Article,Remote Sens.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA

368,On the reliability of seasonal climate forecasts,"Seasonal climate forecasts are being used increasingly across a range of application sectors. A recent UK governmental report asked: how good are seasonal forecasts on a scale of 1-5 (where 5 is very good), and how good can we expect them to be in 30 years time? Seasonal forecasts are made from ensembles of integrations of numerical models of climate. We argue that 'goodness' should be assessed first and foremost in terms of the probabilistic reliability of these ensemble-based forecasts; reliable inputs are essential for any forecast-based decision-making. We propose that a '5' should be reserved for systems that are not only reliable overall, but where, in particular, small ensemble spread is a reliable indicator of low ensemble forecast error. We study the reliability of regional temperature and precipitation forecasts of the current operational seasonal forecast system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, universally regarded as one of the world-leading operational institutes producing seasonal climate forecasts. A wide range of 'goodness' rankings, depending on region and variable (with summer forecasts of rainfall over Northern Europe performing exceptionally poorly) is found. Finally, we discuss the prospects of reaching '5' across all regions and variables in 30 years time.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2013.1162,"Weisheimer, A; Palmer, TN",2014,Article,J. R. Soc.

265,Using Forecast and Observed Weather Data to Assess Performance of Forecast Products in Identifying Heat Waves and Estimating Heat Wave Effects on Mortality,"BACKGROUND: Heat wave and health warning systems are activated based on forecasts of health-threatening hot weather. OBJECTIVE: We estimated heat-mortality associations based on forecast and observed weather data in Detroit, Michigan, and compared the accuracy of forecast products for predicting heat waves. METHODS: We derived and compared apparent temperature (AT) and heat wave days (with heat waves defined as >= 2 days of daily mean AT >= 95th percentile of warm-season average) from weather observations and six different forecast products. We used Poisson regression with and without adjustment for ozone and/or PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) to estimate and compare associations of daily all-cause mortality with observed and predicted AT and heat wave days. RESULTS : The 1-day-ahead forecast of a local operational product, Revised Digital Forecast, had about half the number of false positives compared with all other forecasts. On average, controlling for heat waves, days with observed AT = 25.3 degrees C were associated with 3.5% higher mortality (95% CI: -1.6, 8.8%) than days with AT = 8.5 degrees C. Observed heat wave days were associated with 6.2% higher mortality (95% CI: -0.4, 13.2%) than non-heat wave days. The accuracy of predictions varied, but associations between mortality and forecast heat generally tended to overestimate heat effects, whereas associations with forecast heat waves tended to underestimate heat wave effects, relative to associations based on observed weather metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that incorporating knowledge of local conditions may improve the accuracy of predictions used to activate heat wave and health warning systems.",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1306858,"Zhang, K; Chen, YH; Schwartz, JD; Rood, RB; O'Neill, MS",2014,Article,Environ.

67,"Modelling hourly dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) using dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS)-based approach: case study of Klamath River at Miller Island Boat Ramp, OR, USA","In this study, we present application of an artificial intelligence (AI) technique model called dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) based on an evolving clustering method (ECM), for modelling dissolved oxygen concentration in a river. To demonstrate the forecasting capability of DENFIS, a one year period from 1 January 2009 to 30 December 2009, of hourly experimental water quality data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS Station No: 420853121505500) station at Klamath River at Miller Island Boat Ramp, OR, USA, were used for model development. Two DENFIS-based models are presented and compared. The two DENFIS systems are: (1) offline-based system named DENFIS-OF, and (2) online-based system, named DENFIS-ON. The input variables used for the two models are water pH, temperature, specific conductance, and sensor depth. The performances of the models are evaluated using root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott index of agreement (d) and correlation coefficient (CC) statistics. The lowest root mean square error and highest correlation coefficient values were obtained with the DENFIS-ON method. The results obtained with DENFIS models are compared with linear (multiple linear regression, MLR) and nonlinear (multi-layer perceptron neural networks, MLPNN) methods.

The competition involved a hierarchical load forecasting problem for a US utility with 20 geographical zones. The data available consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity loads for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the locations of either the zones or stations. We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand.

320,Subseasonal forecast skills and biases of global summer monsoons in the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2,"Subseasonal forecast skills and biases of global summer monsoons are diagnosed using daily data from the hindcasts of 45-day integrations by the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2. Predictions for subseasonal variability of zonal wind and precipitation are generally more skillful over the Asian and Australian monsoon regions than other monsoon regions. Climatologically, forecasts for the variations of dynamical monsoon indices have high skills at leads of about 2 weeks. However, apparent interannual differences exist, with high skills up to 5 weeks in exceptional cases. Comparisons for the relationships of monsoon indices with atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns between skillful and unskillful forecasts indicate that skills for subseasonal variability of a monsoon index depend partially on the degree to which the observed variability of the index attributes to the variation of large-scale circulation. Thus, predictions are often more skillful when the index is closely linked to atmospheric circulation over a broad region than over a regional and narrow range. It is also revealed that, the subseasonal variations of biases of winds, precipitation, and surface temperature over various monsoon regions are captured by a first mode with seasonally independent biases and a second mode with apparent phase transition of biases during summer. The first mode indicates the dominance of overall weaker-than-observed summer monsoons over major monsoon regions. However, at certain stages of monsoon evolution, these underestimations are regionally offset or intensified by the time evolving biases portrayed by the second mode. This feature may be partially related to factors such as the shifts of subtropical highs and intertropical convergence zones, the reversal of biases of surface temperature over some monsoon regions, and the transition of regional circulation system. The significant geographical differences in bias growth with increasing lead time reflect the distinctions of initial memory capability of the climate system over different monsoon regions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1831-8,"Liu, XW; Yang, S; Li, QP; Kumar, A; Weaver, S; Liu, S",2014,Article,Clim.

260,Standardized phenology monitoring methods to track plant and animal activity for science and resource management applications,"Phenology offers critical insights into the responses of species to climate change; shifts in species' phenologies can result in disruptions to the ecosystem processes and services upon which human livelihood depends. To better detect such shifts, scientists need long-term phenological records covering many taxa and across a broad geographic distribution. To date, phenological observation efforts across the USA have been geographically limited and have used different methods, making comparisons across sites and species difficult. To facilitate coordinated cross-site, cross-species, and geographically extensive phenological monitoring across the nation, the USA National Phenology Network has developed in situ monitoring protocols standardized across taxonomic groups and ecosystem types for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine plant and animal taxa. The protocols include elements that allow enhanced detection and description of phenological responses, including assessment of phenological ""status"", or the ability to track presence-absence of a particular phenophase, as well as standards for documenting the degree to which phenological activity is expressed in terms of intensity or abundance. Data collected by this method can be integrated with historical phenology data sets, enabling the development of databases for spatial and temporal assessment of changes in status and trends of disparate organisms. To build a common, spatially, and temporally extensive multi-taxa phenological data set available for a variety of research and science applications, we encourage scientists, resources managers, and others conducting ecological monitoring or research to consider utilization of these standardized protocols for tracking the seasonal activity of plants and animals.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-014-0789-5,"Denny, EG; Gerst, KL; Miller-Rushing, AJ; Tierney, GL; Crimmins, TM; Enquist, CAF; Guertin, P; Rosemartin, AH; Schwartz, MD; Thomas, KA; Weltzin, JF",2014,Article,Int.

140,"Interannual variability of the South Pacific Ocean in observations and simulated by the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2","The mechanism of the South Pacific Ocean Dipole (SPOD) mode is examined, using a 50-year simulation of the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2) and 50-year observation-based ocean-atmosphere analyses (1961-2010). It is shown that the SPOD, a sea surface temperatures (SST) seesaw between the subtropics and extratropics, is the dominant mode of the interannual variability in the South Pacific in both observations and CFSv2 simulation. CFSv2 also reproduces the seasonal phase-locking of the observed SPOD, with the anomaly pattern developing in austral spring, peaking in summer, and decaying in autumn. Composite analyses based on both observational and model data suggest that in the warm phase of SPOD, positive SST anomaly (SSTA) is initiated by weakened westerly winds over the central South Pacific in austral spring, which suppress the surface evaporative heat loss and reduce the oceanic mixed layer depth, both contributing to the SST warming. The wind-SST-mixed layer anomalies then evolve coherently over the next two seasons while the cold SSTA develops to the north. The wind perturbations are in turn a response to El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which forces an atmospheric planetary wave train, the Pacific-South American pattern, emanating from an anomalous heat source in the tropical western Pacific. Moreover, SPOD is significantly correlated with the southern annular mode (SAM) while the latter is also significantly correlated with the ENSO index. This suggests that ENSO's influence on the SPOD may be partially conveyed through SAM.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2148-y,"Guan, YH; Huang, BH; Zhu, JS; Hu, ZZ; Kinter, JL",2014,Article,Clim.

206,Model ensemble for the simulation of plankton community dynamics of Lake Kinneret (Israel) induced from in situ predictor variables by evolutionary computation,"This study addresses the need for operational models in view of rapidly advancing in situ sensor technology that puts lakes into online surveillance mode. A model ensemble for simulating plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret (Israel) from 1988 to 1999 has been induced from electronically-measurable predictor variables (EMPV) such as water temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. It cascade wise predicts the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios TN/TP, concentrations of chlorophyta, baccilariophyta, cyanophyta and dinophyta, as well as densities of rotifera, cladocera and copepoda solely from EMPV. The best coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been achieved with 0.6 by the dinophyta model, 0.45 by the rotifera model and 0.44 by the bacillariophyta model. The worst coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been produced by the cladocera model with 0.24 and by the TN/TP model with 0.28. Despite the differences in the r(2) values and apart from the cladocera model, the remaining models matched reasonably well seasonal and interannual plankton dynamics observed over 11 years in Lake Kinneret. The model ensemble developed by HEA also revealed ecological thresholds and relationships determining plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret solely based on in situ predictor variables.

96,The NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2,"The second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979-2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982-2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00823.1,"Saha, S; Moorthi, S; Wu, XR; Wang, J; Nadiga, S; Tripp, P; Behringer, D; Hou, YT; Chuang, HY; Iredell, M; Ek, M; Meng, J; Yang, RQ; Mendez, MP; Van Den Dool, H; Zhang, Q; Wang, WQ; Chen, MY; Becker, E",2014,Article,J.

25,Earlier-Season Vegetation Has Greater Temperature Sensitivity of Spring Phenology in Northern Hemisphere,"In recent decades, satellite-derived start of vegetation growing season (SOS) has advanced in many northern temperate and boreal regions. Both the magnitude of temperature increase and the sensitivity of the greenness phenology to temperature-the phenological change per unit temperature-can contribute the advancement. To determine the temperature-sensitivity, we examined the satellite-derived SOS and the potentially effective pre-season temperature (T-eff) from 1982 to 2008 for vegetated land between 30 degrees N and 80 degrees N. Earlier season vegetation types, i.e., the vegetation types with earlier SOSmean (mean SOS for 1982-2008), showed greater advancement of SOS during 1982-2008. The advancing rate of SOS against year was also greater in the vegetation with earlier SOSmean even the T-eff increase was the same. These results suggest that the spring phenology of vegetation may have high temperature sensitivity in a warmer area. Therefore it is important to consider temperature-sensitivity in assessing broad-scale phenological responses to climatic warming. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms and ecological consequences of the temperature-sensitivity of start of growing season in a warming climate.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0088178,"Shen, MG; Tang, YH; Chen, J; Yang, X; Wang, C; Cui, XY; Yang, YP; Han, LJ; Li, L; Du, JH; Zhang, GX; Cong, N",2014,Article,PLoS One,English,abby lewis,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
205,Phenology research for natural resource management in the United States,"Natural resource professionals in the United States recognize that climate-induced changes in phenology can substantially affect resource management. This is reflected in national climate change response plans recently released by major resource agencies. However, managers on-the-ground are often unclear about how to use phenological information to inform their management practices. Until recently, this was at least partially due to the lack of broad-based, standardized phenology data collection across taxa and geographic regions. Such efforts are now underway, albeit in very early stages. Nonetheless, a major hurdle still exists: phenology-linked climate change research has focused more on describing broad ecological changes rather than making direct connections to local to regional management concerns. To help researchers better design relevant research for use in conservation and management decision-making processes, we describe phenology-related research topics that facilitate ""actionable"" science. Examples include research on evolution and phenotypic plasticity related to vulnerability, the demographic consequences of trophic mismatch, the role of invasive species, and building robust ecological forecast models. Such efforts will increase phenology literacy among on-the-ground resource managers and provide information relevant for short- and long-term decision-making, particularly as related to climate response planning and implementing climate-informed monitoring in the context of adaptive management. In sum, we argue that phenological information is a crucial component of the resource management toolbox that facilitates identification and evaluation of strategies that will reduce the vulnerability of natural systems to climate change. Management-savvy researchers can play an important role in reaching this goal.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-013-0772-6,"Enquist, CAF; Kellermann, JL; Gerst, KL; Miller-Rushing, AJ",2014,Article,Int.

86,"The role of tropical cyclones in stimulating cyanobacterial (Microcystis spp.) blooms in hypertrophic Lake Taihu, China","Weather-related disturbances, such as wind-generated waves, major rainfall events and large temperature shifts associated with frontal passages, are important drivers of ecological processes in shallow lakes. The influence of Pacific tropical cyclones on cyanobacterial blooms in China's third largest lake, Taihu, was studied during the passage of two typhoons using a continuous monitoring as part of an on-lake high-frequency recording platform, coupled to satellite-based remote sensing data. Short-term (on the order of hours) nutrient pulsing resulting from the passage of typhoons played a key role in bloom initiation and maintenance. Decreasing wind speeds and increasing air and water temperatures in the aftermath of cyclones were accompanied by elevated phytoplankton biomass concentrations. The synergistic effects of nutrient pulsing, elevated water temperatures and increased water column stratification after the passage of the cyclones stimulated blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. There were short-term successions of blooms following typhoons, and as blooms ""crashed"" they provided nutrient inocula for future blooms. Trends determined from historical in situ data indicated higher frequencies and intensities of blooms in ""cyclone years"". Typhoons are an important driver of biogeochemical and water quality perturbations at the ecosystem-level in this hypertrophic lake. These events play a key role in our ability to forecast blooms over both short (days) and longer-term (weeks) periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

219,On the Seasonal Forecasting of Regional Tropical Cyclone Activity,"Tropical cyclones (TCs) are a hazard to life and property and a prominent element of the global climate system; therefore, understanding and predicting TC location, intensity, and frequency is of both societal and scientific significance. Methodologies exist to predict basinwide, seasonally aggregated TC activity months, seasons, and even years in advance. It is shown that a newly developed high-resolution global climate model can produce skillful forecasts of seasonal TC activity on spatial scales finer than basinwide, from months and seasons in advance of the TC season. The climate model used here is targeted at predicting regional climate and the statistics of weather extremes on seasonal to decadal time scales, and comprises high-resolution (50 km x 50 km) atmosphere and land components as well as more moderate-resolution (similar to 100 km) sea ice and ocean components. The simulation of TC climatology and interannual variations in this climate model is substantially improved by correcting systematic ocean biases through ""flux adjustment."" A suite of 12-month duration retrospective forecasts is performed over the 1981-2012 period, after initializing the climate model to observationally constrained conditions at the start of each forecast period, using both the standard and flux-adjusted versions of the model. The standard and flux-adjusted forecasts exhibit equivalent skill at predicting Northern Hemisphere TC season sea surface temperature, but the flux-adjusted model exhibits substantially improved basinwide and regional TC activity forecasts, highlighting the role of systematic biases in limiting the quality of TC forecasts. These results suggest that dynamical forecasts of seasonally aggregated regional TC activity months in advance are feasible.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00158.1,"Vecchi, GA; Delworth, T; Gudgel, R; Kapnick, S; Rosati, A; Wittenberg, AT; Zeng, F; Anderson, W; Balaji, V; Dixon, K; Jia, L; Kim, HS; Krishnamurthy, L; Msadek, R; Stern, WF; Underwood, SD; Villarini, G; Yang, X; Zhang, S",2014,Article,J.

421,MJO prediction in the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2,"The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the primary mode of tropical intraseasonal climate variability and has significant modulation of global climate variations and attendant societal impacts. Advancing prediction of the MJO using state of the art observational data and modeling systems is thus a necessary goal for improving global intraseasonal climate prediction. MJO prediction is assessed in the NOAA Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) based on its hindcasts initialized daily for 1999-2010. The analysis focuses on MJO indices taken as the principal components of the two leading EOFs of combined 15 degrees S-15 degrees N average of 200-hPa zonal wind, 850-hPa zonal wind and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The CFSv2 has useful MJO prediction skill out to 20 days at which the bivariate anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) drops to 0.5 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) increases to the level of the prediction with climatology. The prediction skill also shows a seasonal variation with the lowest ACC during the boreal summer and highest ACC during boreal winter. The prediction skills are evaluated according to the target as well as initial phases. Within the lead time of 10 days the ACC is generally greater than 0.8 and RMSE is less than 1 for all initial and target phases. At longer lead time, the model shows lower skills for predicting enhanced convection over the Maritime Continent and from the eastern Pacific to western Indian Ocean. The prediction skills are relatively higher for target phases when enhanced convection is in the central Indian Ocean and the central Pacific. While the MJO prediction skills are improved in CFSv2 compared to its previous version, systematic errors still exist in the CFSv2 in the maintenance and propagation of the MJO including (1) the MJO amplitude in the CFSv2 drops dramatically at the beginning of the prediction and remains weaker than the observed during the target period and (2) the propagation in the CFSv2 is too slow. Reducing these errors will be necessary for further improvement of the MJO prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1806-9,"Wang, WQ; Hung, MP; Weaver, SJ; Kumar, A; Fu, XH",2014,Article,Clim.

414,A model using marginal efficiency of investment to analyze carbon and nitrogen interactions in terrestrial ecosystems (ACONITE Version 1),"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles are coupled in terrestrial ecosystems through multiple processes including photosynthesis, tissue allocation, respiration, N fixation, N uptake, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. Capturing the constraint of N on terrestrial C uptake and storage has been a focus of the Earth System Modeling community. However, there is little understanding of the trade-offs and sensitivities of allocating C and N to different tissues in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Here we describe a new, simple model of ecosystem C-N cycling and interactions (ACONITE), that builds on theory related to plant economics in order to predict key ecosystem properties (leaf area index, leaf C: N, N fixation, and plant C use efficiency) based on the outcome of assessments of the marginal change in net C or N uptake associated with a change in allocation of C or N to plant tissues. We simulated and evaluated steady-state ecosystem stocks and fluxes in three different forest ecosystems types (tropical evergreen, temperate deciduous, and temperate evergreen). Leaf C : N differed among the three ecosystem types (temperate deciduous< tropical evergreen< temperature evergreen), a result that compared well to observations from a global database describing plant traits. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) estimates compared well to observed fluxes at the simulation sites. Simulated N fixation at steady-state, calculated based on relative demand for N and the marginal return on C investment to acquire N, was an order of magnitude higher in the tropical forest than in the temperate forest, consistent with observations. A sensitivity analysis revealed that parameterization of the relationship between leaf N and leaf respiration had the largest influence on leaf area index and leaf C : N. A parameter governing how photosynthesis scales with day length had the largest influence on total vegetation C, GPP, and NPP. Multiple parameters associated with photosynthesis, respiration, and N uptake influenced the rate of N fixation. Overall, our ability to constrain leaf area index and allow spatially and temporally variable leaf C : N can help address challenges simulating these properties in ecosystem and Earth System models. Furthermore, the simple approach with emergent properties based on coupled C-N dynamics has potential for use in research that uses data-assimilation methods to integrate data on both the C and N cycles to improve C flux forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-2015-2014,"Thomas, RQ; Williams, M",2014,Article,Geosci.

298,Probabilistic prediction of cyanobacteria abundance in a Korean reservoir using a Bayesian Poisson model,"There have been increasing reports of harmful algal blooms (HABs) worldwide. However, the factors that influence cyanobacteria dominance and HAB formation can be site-specific and idiosyncratic, making prediction challenging. The drivers of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Paldang, South Korea, the summer climate of which is strongly affected by the East Asian monsoon, may differ from those in well-studied North American lakes. Using the observational data sampled during the growing season in 2007-2011, a Bayesian hurdle Poisson model was developed to predict cyanobacteria abundance in the lake. The model allowed cyanobacteria absence (zero count) and nonzero cyanobacteria counts to be modeled as functions of different environmental factors. The model predictions demonstrated that the principal factor that determines the success of cyanobacteria was temperature. Combined with high temperature, increased residence time indicated by low outflow rates appeared to increase the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence. A stable water column, represented by low suspended solids, and high temperature were the requirements for high abundance of cyanobacteria. Our model results had management implications; the model can be used to forecast cyanobacteria watch or alert levels probabilistically and develop mitigation strategies of cyanobacteria blooms.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2013WR014372,"Cha, Y; Park, SS; Kim, K; Byeon, M; Stow, CA",2014,Article,Water Resour.

153,Inter-annual variability influences the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range-shifting,"Understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species under rapid climate change is vital for both accurate forecasting of biodiversity responses and for developing effective management strategies. Using an individual-based model we demonstrate that the presence and form (colour) of inter-annual variability in environmental conditions can impact the evolution of dispersal during range shifts. Under stable climate, temporal variability typically results in higher dispersal. However, at expanding margins, inter-annual variability actually inhibits the evolution of higher emigration propensities by disrupting the spatial sorting and natural selection processes. These results emphasize the need for future theoretical studies, as well as predictive modelling, to account for the potential impacts of inter-annual variability.",https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.228,"Henry, RC; Bocedi, G; Dytham, C; Travis, JMJ",2014,Article,PeerJ,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
102,EFFECTS OF LAND USE AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON STREAM TEMPERATURE I: DAILY FLOW AND STREAM TEMPERATURE PROJECTIONS,"Freshwater mussels (order Unionida) are a highly imperiled group of organisms that are at risk from rising stream temperatures (T). There is a need to understand the potential effects of land use (LU) and climate change (CC) on stream T and have a measure of uncertainty. We used available downscaled climate projections and LU change simulations to simulate the potential effects on average daily stream T from 2020 to 2060. Monte Carlo simulations were run, and a novel technique to analyze results was used to assess changes in hydrologic and stream T response. Simulations of daily mean T were used as input to our stochastic hourly T model. CC effects were on average two orders of magnitude greater than LU impacts on mean daily stream T. LU change affected stream T primarily in headwater streams, on average up to 2.1 degrees C over short durations, and projected CC affected stream T, on average 2.1-3.3 degrees C by 2060. Daily mean flow and T ratios from Monte Carlo simulations indicated greater variance in the response of streamflow (up to 55%) to LU change than in the response of stream T (up to 9%), and greater variance in headwater stream segments compared to higher order stream segments for both streamflow and T response. Simulations indicated that combined effects of climate and LU change were not additive, suggesting a complex interaction and that forecasting long-term stream T response requires simulating CC and LU change simultaneously.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12179,"Daraio, JA; Bales, JD",2014,Article,J.

38,A model to forecast the risk periods of Plantago pollen allergy by using the ANN methodology,"Some biological particles present in the atmosphere, such as pollen grains, give rise to human health problems, allergies, and infections. In view of the recognized special allergenic ability of Plantago pollen grains, a model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed in this work in order to forecast the Plantago airborne pollen concentration. The proposed model uses data from Plantago pollen and the main meteorological variables recorded during 16 years (1993-2008) in the city of Ourense (northwest Spain). Its accuracy was tested during the years 2009 and 2010 with a prediction horizon of 2 days in advance. The model was applied in the atmosphere of the city of Ourense (Spain). Obtained results show that ANN model provides good results against other classical mathematical methodologies, which do not convergence so well.

402,Forecasting future estuarine hypoxia using a wavelet based neural network model,"Ecosystem based modeling and predictions of hypoxia in estuaries and their adjacent coastal areas have become increasingly of interest to researchers and coastal zone managers. Although progress has been made in modeling oxygen dynamics and short-term predictions, there is still a lack of long-term forecasts that incorporate multiple inputs including climatological effects such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In this study, we first develop a hypoxic volume index (HV1) using 26-years of hypoxic volume (<62.5 mu m gl(-1)) measurements from the main-stem of the Chesapeake Bay. Then a cross-wavelet analysis is used to identify and weight input parameters in order to build a neural network model of future hypoxic volume. The time-forward dynamic model uses cross-bay winds along with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), and Susquehanna River flow indexes to predict a hypoxic volume index over the next several years. Wavelet analysis indicates an anti-phase relationship between southwesterly winds and hypoxic volume index, and an 18-month phase lag between Susquehanna River index and hypoxic volume index. The neural network model results yield R-values of 0.99, and 0.91 for training, and validation and an R-2 of 0.68 for predictions illustrating the usefulness and promise of these types of models for long-term predictions of hypoxic volume. Model results could be used as a climatologically based hypoxic volume baseline for comparing actual hypoxic volume response to nutrient load reductions.

316,Forecasting for Recreational Fisheries Management: What's the Catch?,"The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 required regional fishery management councils to implement annual catch limits (ACLs) for nearly all stocks under U.S. federal management. Since 2011, the number of stocks requiring ACLs (and monitoring) has increased nearly 10-fold, with strict accountability measures requiring either in-season quota closures or shortening of subsequent seasons to avoid ACL overages. Robust forecasts of landings can also provide a projected baseline for evaluation of proposed management alternatives. We compared generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models in terms of fit, accuracy, and ability to forecast landings of four representative fish stocks that support recreational fisheries in the southeastern United States. All models were useful in developing reliable forecasts to inform management. The GAMs provided the best fit to the observed data; however, the modeling approaches of the SARIMA model and GLM provided the best forecasts for most scenarios. The SARIMA model and GLM also provided the best predictions of the seasonal trend in landings, a desirable feature for in-season quota monitoring. The SARIMA model was more sensitive and the GLM was less sensitive to recent trends, providing a useful ""bookend"" for forecasts. The time span of input data affected forecast accuracy from all model types considered. This study suggests multiple forecasting models should be investigated and performance metrics carefully selected and evaluated, as no single model is likely to perform best for all stocks of interest.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.1044628,"Farmer, NA; Froeschke, JT",2015,Article,North Am.

379,Medium Range Daily Reference Evapotranspiration Forecasting by Using ANN and Public Weather Forecasts,"Medium range daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts are very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators for improving their irrigation scheduling. We tested four artificial neural networks (ANNs) for ETo forecasting using forecasted temperatures data retrieved from public weather forecasts. Daily meteorological data were collected to train and validate the ANNs against the Penman-Monteith (PM) model. And then, the temperature forecasts for 7-day ahead were entered into the validated ANNs to produce ETo forecast outputs. The forecasting performances of models were evaluated through comparisons between the ETo forecasted by ANNs and ETo calculated by PM from the observed meteorological data. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.91, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within +/- 2 A degrees C) ranged from 68.34 to 91.61 %, whereas for the maximum temperature it ranged from 51.78 to 57.44 %. The accuracy of the ETo forecast (error within +/- 1.5 mm day(-1)) ranged from 75.53 to 78.14 %, the average values of the mean absolute error ranged from 0.99 to 1.09 mm day(-1), the average values of the root mean square error ranged from 0.87 to 1.36 mm day(-1), and the average values of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.70 to 0.75. The results suggested that ANNs can be considered as a promising ETo forecasting tool.

123,Development of a Oak Pollen Emission and Transport Modeling Framework in South Korea,"Pollen is closely related to health issues such as allergenic rhinitis and asthma as well as intensifying atopic syndrome. Information on current and future spatio-temporal distribution of allergenic pollen is needed to address such issues. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling (CMAQ) was utilized as a base modeling system to forecast pollen dispersal from oak trees. Pollen emission is one of the most important parts in the dispersal modeling system. Areal emission factor was determined from gridded areal fraction of oak trees, which was produced by the analysis of the tree type maps (1: 5000) obtained from the Korea Forest Service. Daily total pollen production was estimated by a robust multiple regression model of weather conditions and pollen concentration. Hourly emission factor was determined from wind speed and friction velocity. Hourly pollen emission was then calculated by multiplying areal emission factor, daily total pollen production, and hourly emission factor. Forecast data from the KMA UM LDAPS (Korea Meteorological Administration Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System) was utilized as input. For the verification of the model, daily observed pollen concentration from 12 sites in Korea during the pollen season of 2014. Although the model showed a tendency of over-estimation in terms of the seasonal and daily mean concentrations, overall concentration was similar to the observation. Comparison at the hourly output showed distinctive delay of the peak hours by the model at the 'Pocheon' site. It was speculated that the constant release of hourly number of pollen in the modeling framework caused the delay.",https://doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2015.25.2.221,"Lim, YK; Kim, KR; Cho, C; Kim, M; Choi, HS; Han, MJ; Oh, I; Kim, BJ",2015,Article,Atmos.-Korea,Korean,mary lofton,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,paper is in korean,1
33,Crop Model Data Assimilation with Particle Filter for Yield Prediction Using Leaf Area Index of Different Temporal Scales,"Crop yield prediction is a significant component of national food security assessment and food policy making. The data assimilation method which combined crop growth model and multi-source observed data has been proven to be the most effective method to simulate the crop growth process and predict crop yields. Based on the observed LAI, the time-series LAI data sets were obtained by using the smooth unequally spaced interpolation. With the support of amount of related data, the crop model of Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)Wheat can be used to simulate the growth of the winter wheat, and the particle filtering-based data assimilation strategy also could be implemented to improve the CERES-Wheat simulation process. Through the assimilation strategy, the incorporation between the observed and modeled LAIs was performed under the dynamic framework of the winter wheat growth process such that the LAI simulation was sequentially optimized, which led to optimal yield estimation. Comparing the measured the data with the assimilation and no assimilation results, it obvious showed that the yield estimations were dramatically improved after assimilation. Then considering the influence of the observed leaf area index on the assimilation process at multi-temporal scale, this paper try to analysis the uncertainty of the assimilation results from three aspects of temporal scale: First, Assimilating the observed LAI data at five kinds of temporal resolution (2day, 4-day, 8-day, 16-day, 32-day), the results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation tended to significantly improve as the temporal resolution of assimilating LAI increased from 32day to 2-day. In addition, as the increasing of the temporal resolution, the computing time increased dramatically. Second, the observed LAI data was applied to assimilation with the four different stages of crop growth (green-jointing, jointing-heading, heading-mature, green-mature). The results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation by assimilating the LAI at the stages of the green-mature (the whole growth phase) is the highest, while the accuracy during the stages from the greenjointing is the lowest. And also the accuracy during the stages from jointing-heading is the second highest. Third, the observed LAI data was used to assimilation with synthesizing the temporal resolution and the stages of crop growth (three kinds of temporal resolution (2, 4, 8 day) and four stages of crop growth). The results showed that on the premise of the optimal efficiency and accuracy, the optimal plan is to select observed LAI by using the temporal resolution of 8 day during the stages from jointingheading. This study will be a better influence on decreasing the calculation time and improving the effect for the crop model data assimilation.",NA,"Li, H; Chen, ZX; Wu, WB; Jiang, ZW; Liu, B; Hasi, T",2015,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,"Modeling, not forecasting",NA
93,Forecasting the Effects of Fertility Control on Overabundant Ungulates: White-Tailed Deer in the National Capital Region,"Overabundant populations of ungulates have caused environmental degradation and loss of biological diversity in ecosystems throughout the world. Culling or regulated harvest is often used to control overabundant species. These methods are difficult to implement in national parks, other types of conservation reserves, or in residential areas where public hunting may be forbidden by policy. As a result, fertility control has been recommended as a non-lethal alternative for regulating ungulate populations. We evaluate this alternative using white-tailed deer in national parks in the vicinity of Washington, D.C., USA as a model system. Managers seek to reduce densities of white-tailed deer from the current average (50 deer per km(2)) to decrease harm to native plant communities caused by deer. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model using 13 years of population estimates from 8 national parks in the National Capital Region Network. We offer a novel way to evaluate management actions relative to goals using short term forecasts. Our approach confirms past analyses that fertility control is incapable of rapidly reducing deer abundance. Fertility control can be combined with culling to maintain a population below carrying capacity with a high probability of success. This gives managers confronted with problematic overabundance a framework for implementing management actions with a realistic assessment of uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143122,"Raiho, AM; Hooten, MB; Bates, S; Hobbs, NT",2015,Article,PLoS One,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
204,Modelling and forecasting the heterogeneous distribution of picocyanobacteria in the tropical Lajes Reservoir (Brazil) by evolutionary computation,"Five years of water quality data from six stations across the mesotrophic and oligomictic Lajes Reservoir (Brazil) were utilized to develop 7-day ahead forecasting models for the picocyanobacteria Cyanodictyon imperfectum, Cyanogranis ferruginea and Synechococcus sp. by means of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. The data included physical and chemical water quality parameters as well as abundance data of the three picocyanobacteria. Models based on site-specific data of six monitoring stations forecasted population dynamics of Synechococcus with coefficients of determination (r (2)) between 0.58 for and 0.88, of Cyanodictyon with r (2) between 0.5 and 0.89 and of Cyanogranis with r (2) between 0.53 and 0.77. Despite phosphorus limiting conditions the sensitivity analysis revealed that the three picocyanobacteria responded much stronger to nitrate rather than to phosphate concentrations throughout the Lajes Reservoir suggesting that cyanobacteria may have adopted the sulphur-for-phosphorus strategy by utilizing sulfolipids instead. Cyanogranis displayed a negative relationship with increasing water temperature indicating its higher competitiveness at internal nutrient supply and low light levels during winter turnover. The resulting models will inform operational intervention and prevention of fast growth and dispersal of picocyanobacteria in Lajes Reservoir, and reveal environmental thresholds for outbreaks of such events.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2144-6,"Recknagel, F; Branco, CWC; Cao, HQ; Huszar, VLM; Sousa, IF",2015,Article,Hydrobiologia,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
226,Forecasting of chlorophyll-a concentrations in South San Francisco Bay using five different models,"Accurate and reliable eutrophication level forecasting models are necessary for characterizing complicated water quality processes in bays. In this study, the ability of coupled discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with artificial neural network (ANN) and multi linear regression (MLR) (WANN and WMLR), ANN, MLR and genetic algorithm-support vector regression (GA-SVR) models for chlorophyll-a level forecasting applications were considered. The data used to develop and validate the models were monthly chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data recorded from January 1994 to December 2013 were obtained from the NO.36 station located in the South San Francisco bay, USA. In the proposed WANN and WMLR models, the observed time series of Chl-a were decomposed to sub time series at different scales by DWT. Afterwards, the sub time series were used as input data to the ANN and MLR systems to predict the 1 month ahead Chl-a. Also the genetic algorithm was linked to SVR models to search for the optimal SVR parameters. The relative performance of the proposed models was compared together and the results showed that the WANN models were found to provide more accurate monthly Chl-a forecasts compared to the other models. The determination coefficient was 0.87, -0.04, 0.31, -2.36 and 0.24 for the WANN, WMLR, ANN, MLR and GA-SVR models, respectively. In addition, the WANN model predicted extreme Chl-a values precisely.

20,Expected future performance of salmon abundance forecast models with varying complexity,"We evaluated the scope for improving abundance forecasts for fishery management using Sacramento River fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) as a case study. A range of forecast models that related the Sacramento Index (SI; an index of adult ocean abundance) to jack (estimated age 2) spawning escapement the previous year were considered. Alternative models incorporated effects of density dependence, local environmental conditions, the abundance of the previous cohort, and trends or autocorrelation in the jack-to-SI relationship. Forecast performance was assessed in terms of bias, accuracy, ability to track trends in the SI, and management objectives. Several models achieved higher accuracy than the model used for management, but no single model performed best across all criteria, and substantial forecast error remained across all approaches considered. Environmental models generally performed better than the management model, but there were differences in the relative importance of individual environmental variables over time and among model formulations. Accounting for model selection uncertainty in environmental models decreased their forecast performance. Simpler models often had similar or better performance than environmental models. In particular, the model incorporating temporally autocorrelated errors demonstrated potential for modest forecast improvement with relatively little additional model complexity.",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0247,"Winship, AJ; O'Farrell, MR; Satterthwaite, WH; Wells, BK; Mohr, MS",2015,Article,Can.

200,Equation-free mechanistic ecosystem forecasting using empirical dynamic modeling,"It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner-recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1417063112,"Ye, H; Beamish, RJ; Glaser, SM; Grant, SCH; Hsieh, CH; Richards, LJ; Schnute, JT; Sugihara, G",2015,Article,Proc.

257,Cyanobacterial bloom management through integrated monitoring and forecasting in large shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu (China),"The large shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu in China has long suffered from eutrophication and toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Despite considerable efforts to divert effluents from the watershed, the cyanobacterial blooms still reoccur and persist throughout summer. To mitigate cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, a large scale integrated monitoring and forecasting system was developed, and a series of emergency response measures were instigated based on early warning. This system has been in place for 2009-2012. With this integrated monitoring system, it was found that the detectable maximum and average cyanobacterial bloom area were similar to that-before drinking water crisis, indicating that poor eutrophic status and cyanobacterial bloom had persisted without significant alleviation. It also revealed that cyanobacterial bloom would occur after the intense storm, which may be associated with the increase in buoyance of cyanobacterial colonies. Although the cyanobacterial blooms had persisted during the monitoring period, there had been a reduction in frequency and intensity of the cyanobacterial bloom induced black water agglomerates (a phenomenon of algal bloom death decay to release a large amount black dissolved organic matter), and there have been no further drinking water crises. This monitoring and response strategy can reduce the cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, but cannot reduce eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms, problems which will take decades to resolve.

337,Seasonal forecasting of tuna habitat in the Great Australian Bight,"Commercial fishing involves locating fish in a variable environment, and a fisher's historical experience with environmental conditions and the influence on fish distribution underpins their economic efficiency. However, in many regions, changing environments are reducing the utility of this experience. In the Great Australian Bight, recent environmental changes have modified the summer distribution of southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii). This has affected the timing and location of fishing activity and contributed to economic impacts, at the same time as international competition is lowering value of the catch. The SBT purse-seine fishery is managed under a strict quota, so catching more fish is not an option to reduce fixed costs; instead fish must be caught more efficiently in a changing environment. Following discussion with industry stakeholders, we developed a seasonal forecast system based on a three stage process. We first assessed needs through discussions with industry. We then developed a SBT habitat forecast system based on a seasonal environmental forecasting model (POAMA: the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia) coupled with a habitat preference model for SBT (developed using data from tagged fish). Based on a historical evaluation of the environmental forecasting model and the habitat model, we expect temperature-based habitat forecasts to have useful skill up to two months into the future during the months of interest. The final stage involved forecast delivery via an industry-specific website and engagement with stakeholders, which led to improved presentation and contextualization of the forecasts. The forecasts, which are updated daily, are now being used by SBT fishers and have proven a useful aid in their decision-making. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

114,Eutrophication forecasting and management by artificial neural network: a case study at Yuqiao Reservoir in North China,"Yuqiao Reservoir is the potable water supply source for a city with a population of more than 14 million. Eutrophication has threatened the reliability of drinking water supplies and, therefore, the forecasting systems for eutrophication and sound management become urgent needs. Water temperature and total phosphorus have long been considered as the major influencing factors to eutrophication. This study used the artificial neural network (ANN) model to forecast three water quality variables including water temperature, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a in Yuqiao Reservoir. Two weeks in advance for forecasting was chosen to ensure a sufficient preparation response time for algae outbreak. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (R-2) was between 0.84 and 0.99 for the training and over-fitting test data sets, while it was between 0.59 and 0.99 for the validation data set. To better respond to the algae outbreak, a number of management scenarios formed by orthogonal experimental design were modeled to assess the responses of chlorophyll-a and an optimal management scenario was identified, which can reduce chlorophyll-a by 23.8%. This study demonstrates that ANN model is potentially useful for forecasting eutrophication up to 2 weeks in advance. It also provides valuable information for the sound management of nutrient loads to reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2015.115,"Zhang, Y; Huang, JJ; Chen, L; Qi, L",2015,Article,J.

409,Quality of the Governing Temperature Variables in WRF in relation to Simulation of Primary Biological Aerosols,"We have evaluated three prognostic variables in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, mean daily temperature, daily maximum temperature, and daily minimum temperature using 9 months of model simulations at 36 and 12 km resolution, and compared the results with 1182 observational sites in north and central Europe. The quality of the results is then determined in the context of the governing variables used in crop science, forestry, and aerobiological models. We use the results to simulate the peak of the birch pollen season (aerobiology), growth of barley (crop science), and development of the invasive plant pathogen Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (the cause of ash-dieback). The results show that the crop and aerobiological models are particularly sensitive to grid resolution and much higher quality is obtained from the 12 km simulations compared to 36 km. The results also show that the summer months have a bias, in particular for maximum and minimum temperatures, and that the low/high bias is clustered in two areas: continental and coastal influenced areas. It is suggested that the use of results from meteorological models as an input into biological models needs particular attention in the quality of the modelled surface data as well as the applied land surface modules.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/412658,"Skjoth, CA; Werner, M; Kryza, M; Adams-Groom, B; Wakeham, A; Lewis, M; Kennedy, R",2015,Article,Adv.

105,Coupled Data-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm for Toxic Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae) Forecasting in Lake Kinneret,"Cyanobacteria blooming in surface waters have become a major concern worldwide, as they are unsightly, and cause a variety of toxins, undesirable tastes, and odors. Approaches of mathematical process-based (deterministic), statistically based, rule-based (heuristic), and artificial neural networks have been the subject of extensive research for cyanobacteria forecasting. This study suggests a new framework of linking an evolutionary computational method (a genetic algorithm) with a data driven modeling engine (model trees) for external loading, physical, chemical, and biological parameters selection, all coupled with their associated time lags as decision variables for cyanobacteria prediction in surface waters. The methodology is demonstrated through trial runs and sensitivity analyses on Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee), Israel. Model trials produced good matching as depicted through the results correlation coefficient on verification data sets. Temperature was reconfirmed as a predominant parameter for cyanobacteria prediction. Model optimal input variables and forecast horizons differed in various solutions. Those in turn raised the problem of best variables selection, pointing towards the need of a multiobjective optimization model in future extensions of the proposed methodology.

246,Climate forcing datasets for agricultural modeling: Merged products for gap-filling and historical climate series estimation,"The AgMERRA and AgCFSR climate forcing datasets provide daily, high-resolution, continuous, meteorological series over the 1980-2010 period designed for applications examining the agricultural impacts of climate variability and climate change. These datasets combine daily resolution data from retrospective analyses (the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA, and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, CFSR) with in situ and remotely-sensed observational datasets for temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, leading to substantial reductions in bias in comparison to a network of 2324 agricultural-region stations from the Hadley Integrated Surface Dataset (HadISD). Results compare favorably against the original reanalyses as well as the leading climate forcing datasets (Princeton, WFD, WFD-EI, and GRASP), and AgMERRA distinguishes itself with substantially improved representation of daily precipitation distributions and extreme events owing to its use of the MERRA-Land dataset. These datasets also peg relative humidity to the maximum temperature time of day, allowing for more accurate representation of the diurnal cycle of near-surface moisture in agricultural models. AgMERRA and AgCFSR enable a number of ongoing investigations in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and related research networks, and may be used to fill gaps in historical observations as well as a basis for the generation of future climate scenarios.

216,Stochastic partial differential equation based modelling of large space-time data sets,"Increasingly larger data sets of processes in space and time ask for statistical models and methods that can cope with such data. We show that the solution of a stochastic advection-diffusion partial differential equation provides a flexible model class for spatiotemporal processes which is computationally feasible also for large data sets. The Gaussian process defined through the stochastic partial differential equation has, in general, a non-separable covariance structure. Its parameters can be physically interpreted as explicitly modelling phenomena such as transport and diffusion that occur in many natural processes in diverse fields ranging from environmental sciences to ecology. To obtain computationally efficient statistical algorithms, we use spectral methods to solve the stochastic partial differential equation. This has the advantage that approximation errors do not accumulate over time, and that in the spectral space the computational cost grows linearly with the dimension, the total computational cost of Bayesian or frequentist inference being dominated by the fast Fourier transform. The model proposed is applied to post-processing of precipitation forecasts from a numerical weather prediction model for northern Switzerland. In contrast with the raw forecasts from the numerical model, the post-processed forecasts are calibrated and quantify prediction uncertainty. Moreover, they outperform the raw forecasts, in the sense that they have a lower mean absolute error.",https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12061,"Sigrist, F; Kunsch, HR; Stahel, WA",2015,Article,J. R. Stat.

117,Combining Forecast of Electricity Price with Adaptive Weights Selected by SOM Clustering,"This paper proposes an efficient method of combining modelling to forecast day-ahead electricity price. The basic idea of this method is to develop a robust technique to select the proper combining weights of individual models according to their historical performance on similar circumstances. Firstly individuals were trained and validated separately, and then self-organising map neural network (SOM) was applied to cluster the circumstance into multiple categories. For day-ahead price forecasting, the circumstances of the coming day were compared with those of past days and then clustered into the same category by SOM. The combining weights of individual models for next-day price forecasting were determined by their performances in same category in the past. The final forecast was a weighted sum of the individual predictions with the time-varying weights obtained above. An experimental study indicated that the proposed method outperforms other price-forecasting techniques with high efficiency more robustness.",NA,"Feng, Y",2015,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,1,0,1,NA,,,NA
270,Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: An update of research,"Many years have passed since Baesens et al. published their benchmarking study of classification algorithms in credit scoring [Baesens, B., Van Gestel, T., Viaene, S., Stepanova, M., Suykens, J., & Vanthienen, J. (2003). Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring.journal of the Operational Research Society, 54(6), 627-635.]. The interest in prediction methods for scorecard development is unbroken. However, there have been several advancements including novel learning methods, performance measures and techniques to reliably compare different classifiers, which the credit scoring literature does not reflect. To close these research gaps, we update the study of Baesens et al. and compare several novel classification algorithms to the state-of-the-art in credit scoring. In addition, we examine the extent to which the assessment of alternative scorecards differs across established and novel indicators of predictive accuracy. Finally, we explore whether more accurate classifiers are managerial meaningful. Our study provides valuable insight for professionals and academics in credit scoring. It helps practitioners to stay abreast of technical advancements in predictive modeling. From an academic point of view, the study provides an independent assessment of recent scoring methods and offers a new baseline to which future approaches can be compared.

456,The pitfalls of ecological forecasting,"Ecological forecasting is difficult but essential, because reactive management results in corrective actions that are often too late to avert significant environmental damage. Here, we appraise different forecasting methods with a particular focus on the modelling of species populations. We show how simple extrapolation of current trends in state is often inadequate because environmental drivers change in intensity over time and new drivers emerge. However, statistical models, incorporating relationships with drivers, simply offset the prediction problem, requiring us to forecast how the drivers will themselves change over time. Some authors approach this problem by focusing in detail on a single driver, whilst others use storyline' scenarios, which consider projected changes in a wide range of different drivers. We explain why both approaches are problematic and identify a compromise to model key drivers and interactions along with possible response options to help inform environmental management. We also highlight the crucial role of validation of forecasts using independent data. Although these issues are relevant for all types of ecological forecasting, we provide examples based on forecasts for populations of UK butterflies. We show how a high goodness-of-fit for models used to calibrate data is not sufficient for good forecasting. Long-term biological recording schemes rather than experiments will often provide data for ecological forecasting and validation because these schemes allow capture of landscape-scale land-use effects and their interactions with other drivers.",https://doi.org/10.1111/bij.12579,"Oliver, TH; Roy, DB",2015,Article,Biol.

A number of airborne pollen metrics were obtained through the rate of changes of logistic model adjusted to the time series of airborne pollen. In both regions, the mean absolute differences between observed phenology and model-predicted values for start, peak and final of flowering phenophases were always lower than 5 days and the slope of the regression through the origin is close to one. These metrics can be used to accurately and precisely predict the dynamic of Vitis flowering observed at field level.

17,Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Seasonal Distribution of Toxic Cyanobacteria in Western Lake Erie from 2002-2014,"Lake Erie, the world's tenth largest freshwater lake by area, has had recurring blooms of toxic cyanobacteria for the past two decades. These blooms pose potential health risks for recreation, and impact the treatment of drinking water. Understanding the timing and distribution of the blooms may aid in planning by local communities and resources managers. Satellite data provides a means of examining spatial patterns of the blooms. Data sets from MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS (2012-2014) were analyzed to evaluate bloom patterns and frequencies. The blooms were identified using previously published algorithms to detect cyanobacteria (~25,000 cells mL(-1)), as well as a variation of these algorithms to account for the saturation of the MODIS ocean color bands. Images were binned into 10-day composites to reduce cloud and mixing artifacts. The 13 years of composites were used to determine frequency of presence of both detectable cyanobacteria and high risk (>100,000 cells mL(-1)) blooms. The bloom season according to the satellite observations falls within June 1 and October 31. Maps show the pattern of development and areas most commonly impacted during all years (with minor and severe blooms). Frequencies during years with just severe blooms (minor bloom years were not included in the analysis) were examined in the same fashion. With the annual forecasts of bloom severity, these frequency maps can provide public water suppliers and health departments with guidance on the timing of potential risk.",https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins7051649,"Wynne, TT; Stumpf, RP",2015,Article,Toxins,English,abby lewis,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
183,Building the capacity for forecasting marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems: recent advances and future developments,"Building the capacity for monitoring and forecasting marine biogeochemistry and ecosystem dynamics is a scientific challenge of strategic importance in the context of rapid environmental change and growing public awareness of its potential impacts on marine ecosystems and resources. National Operational Oceanography centres have started to take up this challenge by integrating biogeochemistry in operational systems. Ongoing activities are illustrated in this paper by presenting examples of (pre-) operational biogeochemical systems active in Europe and North America for global to regional applications. First-order principles underlying biogeochemical modelling are briefly introduced along with the description of biogeochemical components implemented in these systems. Applications are illustrated with examples from the fields of hindcasting and monitoring ocean primary production, the assessment of the ocean carbon cycle and the management of living resources. Despite significant progress over the past 5 years in integrating biogeochemistry into (pre-) operational data-assimilation systems, a sustained research effort is still needed to assess these systems and their products with respect to their usefulness to the management of marine systems.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1755876X.2015.1022350,"Gehlen, M; Barciela, R; Bertino, L; Brasseur, P; Butenschon, M; Chai, F; Crise, A; Drillet, Y; Ford, D; Lavoie, D; Lehodey, P; Perruche, C; Samuelsen, A; Simon, E",2015,Article,J.

177,A better measure of relative prediction accuracy for model selection and model estimation,"Surveys show that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is the most widely used measure of prediction accuracy in businesses and organizations. It is, however, biased: when used to select among competing prediction methods it systematically selects those whose predictions are too low. This has not been widely discussed and so is not generally known among practitioners. We explain why this happens. We investigate an alternative relative accuracy measure which avoids this bias: the log of the accuracy ratio, that is, log (prediction/actual). Relative accuracy is particularly relevant if the scatter in the data grows as the value of the variable grows (heteroscedasticity). We demonstrate using simulations that for heteroscedastic data (modelled by a multiplicative error factor) the proposed metric is far superior to MAPE for model selection. Another use for accuracy measures is in fitting parameters to prediction models Minimum MAPE models do not predict a simple statistic and so theoretical analysis is limited. We prove that when the proposed metric is used instead, the resulting least squares regression model predicts the geometric mean. This important property allows its theoretical properties to be understood.",https://doi.org/10.1057/jors.2014.103,"Tofallis, C",2015,Article,J. Oper. Res. Soc.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,0,0,NA,,,NA
78,Improvements in the representation of the Indian summer monsoon in the NCEP climate forecast system version 2,"A new triggering mechanism for deep convection based on the heated condensation framework (HCF) is implemented into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction climate forecast system version 2 (CFSv2). The new trigger is added as an additional criterion in the simplified Arakawa-Schubert scheme for deep convection. Seasonal forecasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the new triggering mechanism in the representation of the Indian summer monsoon in the CFSv2. The HCF trigger improves the seasonal representation of precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. The new triggering mechanism leads to a significant, albeit relatively small, improvement in the bias of seasonal precipitation totals. In addition, the new trigger improves the representation of the seasonal precipitation cycle including the monsoon onset, and the probability distribution of precipitation intensities. The mechanism whereby the HCF improves convection over India seems to be related not only to a better representation of the background state of atmospheric convection but also to an increase in the frequency in which SAS is triggered. As a result, there was an increase in convective precipitation over India favored by the availability of moist convective instability. The increase in precipitation intensity leads to a reduction in the dry bias.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2484-6,"Bombardi, RJ; Schneider, EK; Marx, L; Halder, S; Singh, B; Tawfik, AB; Dirmeyer, PA; Kinter, JL",2015,Article,Clim.

201,Online forecasting chlorophyll a concentrations by an auto-regressive integrated moving average model: Feasibilities and potentials,"Algal blooms are commonly observed in freshwater and coastal areas, causing significant damage to drinking water and aquaculture production. Predictive models are effective for algal bloom forecasting and management. In this paper, an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was developed to predict daily chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations, using data from Taihu Lake in China. For comparison, a multivariate linear regression (MVLR) model was also established to predict daily Chl a concentrations using the same data. Results showed that the ARIMA model generally performed better than the MVLR model with respect to the absolute error of peak value, root mean square error and index of agreement. Because the ARIMA model needs only one input variable, it shows greater applicability as an algal bloom early warning system using online sensors of Chl a. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

213,Towards regional grain yield forecasting with 1 km-resolution EO biophysical products: Strengths and limitations at pan-European level,"This study addresses the role of satellite Earth Observation (EO) indicators within an operational crop yield forecasting system for the European Union (EU) and neighbouring countries, by exploring the correlation between official yield statistics and indicators derived from fAPAR time-series at sub-national level for the period 1999-2012, and by identifying possible differences across agro-climatic conditions in Europe. A significant correlation between fAPAR and official yields (R-2 > 0.6) was found in water-limited yield agro-climatic conditions (e.g. the Black Sea region and the Mediterranean basin) for all three crops studied. In regions where crops experience frequent water stress, most of the yield inter-annual variability is explained by substantial changes in leaf area from one year to another, and can be well captured by regional fAPAR time-series. By contrast, in regions characterized by high yields (e.g. northern Europe) - where water constraints are generally not frequent and, therefore, fAPAR inter-annual variability is low - the correlation between fAPAR and yield is weaker (R-2 < 0.5) as yield variations tend to be explained by multiple factors other than green leaf area. These results confirm the reliability of EO time-series for operational crop yield forecasting at regional level, but also suggest that additional meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration) need to be taken into account to interpret EO products meaningfully. Moreover, specific issues related to the spatial resolution of the EO-products, and the absence of dynamic crop masks, currently impede access to crop-specific time-series in the fragmented agricultural landscapes of Europe, and restrict the use of 1-km biophysical products to major crops.

4,Temperature sensitivity of spring vegetation phenology correlates to within-spring warming speed over the Northern Hemisphere,"The inter-annual shift of spring vegetation phenology relative to per unit change of preseason temperature, referred to as temperature sensitivity (days degrees C-1), quantifies the response of spring phenology to temperature change. Temperature sensitivity was found to differ greatly among vegetation from different environmental conditions. Understanding the large-scale spatial pattern of temperature sensitivity and its underlying determinant will greatly improve our ability to predict spring phenology. In this study, we investigated the temperature sensitivity for natural ecosystems over the North Hemisphere (north of 30 degrees N), based on the vegetation phenological date estimated from NDVI time-series data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the corresponding climate dataset. We found a notable longitudinal change pattern with considerable increases of temperature sensitivity from inlands to most coastal areas and a less obvious latitudinal pattern with larger sensitivity in low latitude area. This general spatial variation in temperature sensitivity is most strongly associated with the within-spring warming speed (WWS; r = 0.35, p < 0.01), a variable describing the increase speed of daily mean temperature during spring within a year, compared with other factors including the mean spring temperature, spring precipitation and mean winter temperature. These findings suggest that the same magnitude of warming will less affect spring vegetation phenology in regions with higher WWS, which might partially reflect plants' adaption to local climate that prevents plants from frost risk caused by the advance of spring phenology. WWS accounts for the spatial variation in temperature sensitivity and should be taken into account in forecasting spring phenology and in assessing carbon cycle under the projected climate warming.

95,"Deciduous forest responses to temperature, precipitation, and drought imply complex climate change impacts","Changes in spring and autumn phenology of temperate plants in recent decades have become iconic bio-indicators of rapid climate change. These changes have substantial ecological and economic impacts. However, autumn phenology remains surprisingly little studied. Although the effects of unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., frost, heat, wetness, and drought) on autumn phenology have been observed for over 60 y, how these factors interact to influence autumn phenological events remain poorly understood. Using remotely sensed phenology data from 2001 to 2012, this study identified and quantified significant effects of a suite of environmental factors on the timing of fall dormancy of deciduous forest communities in New England, United States. Cold, frost, and wet conditions, and high heat-stress tended to induce earlier dormancy of deciduous forests, whereas moderate heat- and drought-stress delayed dormancy. Deciduous forests in two eco-regions showed contrasting, nonlinear responses to variation in these explanatory factors. Based on future climate projection over two periods (2041-2050 and 2090-2099), later dormancy dates were predicted in northern areas. However, in coastal areas earlier dormancy dates were predicted. Our models suggest that besides warming in climate change, changes in frost and moisture conditions as well as extreme weather events (e.g., drought- and heat-stress, and flooding), should also be considered in future predictions of autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forests. This study improves our understanding of how multiple environmental variables interact to affect autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems, and points the way to building more mechanistic and predictive models.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1509991112,"Xie, YY; Wang, XJ; Silander, JA",2015,Article,Proc.

400,Forecasting the Impacts of Silver and Bighead Carp on the Lake Erie Food Web,"Nonindigenous bigheaded carps (Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix; hereafter, ""Asian carps"" [AC]) threaten to invade and disrupt food webs and fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes through their high consumption of plankton. To quantify the potential effects of AC on the food web in Lake Erie, we developed an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) food web model and simulated four AC diet composition scenarios (high, low, and no detritus and low detritus with Walleye Sander vitreus and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens larvae) and two nutrient load scenarios (the 1999 baseline load and 2X the baseline [HP]). We quantified the uncertainty of the potential AC effects by coupling the EwE model with estimates of parameter uncertainty in AC production, consumption, and predator diets obtained using structured expert judgment. Our model projected mean +/- SD AC equilibrium biomass ranging from 52 +/- 34 to 104 +/- 75 kg/ha under the different scenarios. Relative to baseline simulations without AC, AC invasion under all detrital diet scenarios decreased the biomass of most fish and zooplankton groups. The effects of AC in the HP scenario were similar to those in the detrital diet scenarios except that the biomasses of most Walleye and Yellow Perch groups were greater under HP because these fishes were buffered from competition with AC by increased productivity at lower trophic levels. Asian carp predation on Walleye and Yellow Perch larvae caused biomass declines among all Walleye and Yellow Perch groups. Large food web impacts of AC occurred in only 2% of the simulations, where AC biomass exceeded 200 kg/ha, resulting in biomass declines of zooplankton and planktivorous fish near the levels observed in the Illinois River. Our findings suggest that AC would affect Lake Erie's food web by competing with other planktivorous fishes and by providing additional prey for piscivores. Our methods provide a novel approach for including uncertainty into forecasts of invasive species' impacts on aquatic food webs.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1069211,"Zhang, HY; Rutherford, ES; Mason, DM; Breck, JT; Wittmann, ME; Cooke, RM; Lodge, DM; Rothlisberger, JD; Zhu, XH; Johnson, TB",2016,Article,Trans.

415,"Use of Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM) in Forecasting Dissolved Oxygen Concentration (DO) Several Hours in Advance: a Case Study from the Klamath River, Oregon, USA","This study presents a new method called optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) for forecasting dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) several hours in advance. The forecast time horizon ranges from 24-h ahead (one day) to 168-h ahead (seven days). The proposed OP-ELM model is compared to the standard multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with respect to their capabilities of forecasting DO in the Klamath River at Miller Island Boat Ramp, Oregon, USA. To demonstrate the forecasting capability of OP-ELM and MLPNN models, we used a long-term data set of hourly DO data for a ten-year period, from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2013, collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS Stations No: 420,853,121,505,500 [Top] and 420,853,121,505,501 [Bottom]). For developing the models, we split the data set into a training subset (from 2004 to 2010) that corresponded to 70 %, and a validation (from 2011 to 2013) that corresponded to 30 % of the total data set. We investigated the performance and accuracy of the proposed two models for three different horizons, i.e., short-term, medium-term and long-term forecasting; a total of six different models (FM1 to FM6), having the same data sets as inputs, were developed for short-term (24 h to 48 h), medium-term (72 h to 96 h) and long-term (120 h to 168 h) horizons. Input variables used in the six models were the six antecedent DO concentrations at (t-5), (t-4), (t-3), (t-2), (t-1) and (t). The performance of the OP-ELM and MLPNN models in training and validation sets were compared with the observed data. To get more accurate evaluation of the results of the two models, the following seven statistical performance indices were used: the coefficient of correlation (R), the Willmott index of agreement (d), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the bias error (Bias), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The study reveals that OP-ELM and MLPN provided good results and they were successful in forecasting DO at a high level of accuracy. The reliability of forecasting decreased with increasing the step ahead. The measures of model performance fell within the acceptable ranges for the two stations. Regarding the fact that researches on medium and long-term forecasting are relatively limited, the present work aims to build and provide a good early warning system capable of preventing DO depletion and the associated problems of anoxia and hypoxia in river. Furthermore, the proposed forecasting models, when implemented appropriately, could be reliably used in detecting future change in DO concentration in rivers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40710-016-0172-0,"Heddam, S",2016,Article,Environ.

This study aims to investigate airborne Olea pollen data from a city on the SW Iberian Peninsula, to analyse the trends in these data and their relationships with meteorological parameters using time series analysis. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from 1994 to 2013 in Badajoz (SW Spain) using a 7-day Hirst-type volumetric sampler.

Due to the allergenic characteristics of this pollen type, it should be necessary to forecast its short-term prevalence using a long record of data in a city with a Mediterranean climate.

30,Vertical distribution of buoyant Microcystis blooms in a Lagrangian particle tracking model for short-term forecasts in Lake Erie,"Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) are a problem in western Lake Erie, and in eutrophic fresh waters worldwide. Western Lake Erie is a large (3000 km(2)), shallow (8 m mean depth), freshwater system. CHABs occur from July to October, when stratification is intermittent in response to wind and surface heating or cooling (polymictic). Existing forecast models give the present location and extent of CHABs from satellite imagery, then predict two-dimensional (surface) CHAB movement in response to meteorology. In this study, we simulated vertical distribution of buoyant Microcystis colonies, and 3-D advection, using a Lagrangian particle model forced by currents and turbulent diffusivity from the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). We estimated the frequency distribution of Microcystis colony buoyant velocity from measured size distributions and buoyant velocities. We evaluated several random-walk numerical schemes to efficiently minimize particle accumulation artifacts. We selected the Milstein scheme, with linear interpolation of the diffusivity profile in place of cubic splines, and varied the time step at each particle and step based on the curvature of the local diffusivity profile to ensure that the Visser time step criterion was satisfied. Inclusion of vertical mixing with buoyancy significantly improved model skill statistics compared to an advection-only model, and showed greater skill than a persistence forecast through simulation day 6, in a series of 26 hindcast simulations from 2011. The simulations and in situ observations show the importance of subtle thermal structure, typical of a polymictic lake, along with buoyancy in determining vertical and horizontal distribution of Microcystis.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JC011720,"Rowe, MD; Anderson, EJ; Wynne, TT; Stumpf, RP; Fanslow, DL; Kijanka, K; Vanderploeg, HA; Strickler, JR; Davis, TW",2016,Article,J.

210,A framework based on hidden Markov model with adaptive weighting for microcystin forecasting and early-warning,"Harmful algal blooms during the eutrophication process produce toxins, such as microcystins (MCs), which endanger the ecosystems and human health. Accurate forecasting and early-warning of MCs can provide theoretical guidance for quick identification of risk in water management systems. The variation of MC concentration is affected by not only the status quo of numerous manifest biotic and abiotic factors, but also a hidden variable that represents the uncertainty of variations of these factors. Traditional approaches focus on fitting data precisely but less consider such a hidden variable, which would experience formidable barriers when encountering fluctuations in time-serial data. In this study, to address the forecasting problem with a hidden state variable and the problem of early-warning-of-risk, we build a novel integrated framework which is consist of three parts: 1) a forecasting model based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an improved Continuous Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) with adaptive exponential weighting (AEW), where the AEW-CHMM is proposed to forecast both the single-step-ahead concentration for general points and fluctuating points, and the three-step-ahead concentration existing immediately after the fluctuating point; 2) Bayesian hierarchical modeling for a ratio estimation; and 3) revised guidelines for the risk-level grading. The case study tests a real dataset of one shallow lake with the proposed approaches and other supervised machine learning methods. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective to offer an intelligent decision support tool for MC forecasting and early warning of risk by risk-level grading.

290,A model-based approach for analog spatio-temporal dynamic forecasting,"Analog forecasting has been applied in a variety of fields for predicting future states of complex nonlinear systems that require flexible forecasting methods. Past analog methods have almost exclusively been used in an empirical framework without the structure of a model-based approach. We propose a Bayesian model framework for analog forecasting, building upon previous analog methods but accounting for parameter uncertainty. Thus, unlike traditional analog forecasting methods, the use of Bayesian modeling allows one to rigorously quantify uncertainty to obtain realistic posterior predictive distributions. The model is applied to the long-lead time forecasting of mid-May averaged soil moisture anomalies in Iowa over a high-resolution grid of spatial locations. Sea surface temperature is used to find past time periods with similar trajectories to the current pre-forecast period. The analog model is developed on projection coefficients from a basis expansion of the soil moisture and sea surface temperature fields. Separate models are constructed for locations falling in each Iowa Crop Reporting District, and the forecasting ability of the proposed model is compared against a variety of alternative methods and metrics.

427,Analysing and forecasting fisheries time series: purse seine in Indian Ocean as a case study,"Catch and fishing effort time series are used by managers to safeguard the availability of resources in the future. Fisheries organizations estimate the status of a stock and the levels for sustainable harvest. Based on these indicators, regulations are developed to guarantee the availability of food and sustain economic growth. For example, tuna stocks are important not only in terms of nutrition, but also for the welfare, culture, revenue, and employment of the countries that rely upon them. However, fisheries time-series are the result of many natural and non-natural factors and are usually difficult to predict. Here, we propose a method to aggregate fisheries time series in space and time, to detect hidden periodicities, to predict the time series in the future and to identify the most stressed locations in the fishing area. We apply our method to tuna fisheries data in the Indian Ocean and compare it with respect to other methods. We demonstrate that the method is able to highlight periodic patterns in this high fishing activity area and to forecast the fisheries time series in the future.

292,Temporal modelling and forecasting of the airborne pollen of Cupressaceae on the southwestern Iberian Peninsula,"Cupressaceae includes species cultivated as ornamentals in the urban environment. This study aims to investigate airborne pollen data for Cupressaceae on the southwestern Iberian Peninsula over a 21-year period and to analyse the trends in these data and their relationship with meteorological parameters using time series analysis. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from 1993 to 2013 in Badajoz (SW Spain). The main pollen season for Cupressaceae lasted, on average, 58 days, ranging from 55 to 112 days, from 24 January to 22 March. Furthermore, a short-term forecasting model has been developed for daily pollen concentrations. The model proposed to forecast the airborne pollen concentration is described by one equation. This expression is composed of two terms: the first term represents the pollen concentration trend in the air according to the average concentration of the previous 10 days; the second term is obtained from considering the actual pollen concentration value, which is calculated based on the most representative meteorological parameters multiplied by a fitting coefficient. Temperature was the main meteorological factor by its influence over daily pollen forecast, being the rain the second most important factor. This model represents a good approach to a continuous balance model of Cupressaceae pollen concentration and is supported by a close agreement between the observed and predicted mean concentrations. The novelty of the proposed model is the analysis of meteorological parameters that are not frequently used in Aerobiology.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-015-1026-6,"Silva-Palacios, I; Fernandez-Rodriguez, S; Duran-Barroso, P; Tormo-Molina, R; Maya-Manzano, JM; Gonzalo-Garijo, A",2016,Article,Int.

197,"Threshold quantification and short-term forecasting of Anabaena, Aphanizomenon and Microcystis in the polymictic eutrophic Lake Muggelsee (Germany) by inferential modelling using the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA","Forecasting models for Anabaena, Aphanizomenon and Microcystis have been developed for the hypertrophic phase from 1979 to 1990 and the eutrophic phase from 1997 to 2012 of the polymictic Lake Muggelsee by means of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. Comparisons of limnological parameters of the two phases revealed not only a distinct seasonal extension of N-limitation but also higher water temperatures that rose earlier and lasted longer between spring and autumn from 1997 to 2012. These differences were reflected by threshold conditions and sensitivity functions of the cyanobacteria-specific models evolved by HEA for the two phases. Seven-day-ahead forecasts matched well timings of peaking biomass observed for the three cyanobacteria but partially failed to predict accurate magnitudes, whereby coefficients of determination r (2) ranged between 0.48 and 0.76 for models in Phase I and between 0.42 and 0.69 in Phase II. The threshold conditions of the models quantified ranges of key predictor variables such as water temperature and transparency, concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P that were symptomatic for sudden outbreaks of high biomass of the three cyanobacteria. Sensitivity functions extracted from 20 best performing models for each of the three cyanobacteria in both phases indicated different abundances between N-fixing Anabaena and Aphanizomenon compared to non-N-fixing Microcystis in response to strengthened N-limitation in Phase II.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2442-7,"Recknagel, F; Adrian, R; Kohler, J; Cao, HQ",2016,Article; Proceedings Paper,Hydrobiologia,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yes,NA
255,A HAB warning system for shellfish harvesting in Portugal,"The development of sustainable shellfish aquaculture is highly dependent on the provision of reliable monitoring and predictive information on the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). The Portuguese HAB early warning system and shellfish closures presented here is a prototype, developed in the ASIMUTH project. It relies on weekly monitoring data composed of observations of HAB species and toxin concentrations within shellfish, and ocean circulation forecasts generated by an operational oceanographic model. The shellfish harvesting areas comprise coastal areas, estuaries + rias and coastal lagoons. The weekly bulletin characterizes the current shellfish closure situation and next week's forecasts for potentially impacted areas. The period analyzed ranged from 27 July 2013 to 17 March 2014, and describes the first skill assessment of the warning system. The forecast accuracy was evaluated, considering the number of forecasts that were verified to be correct the following week (85%) as well as the number of events not forecasted (false negatives, 12%) and those expected but did not occur (false positives, 3%). Variations were most visible in the first weeks of bulletin implementation and during autumn-winter months. The complementary use of field data, remote sensing and operational models led to more accurate predictions of blooms and range of the event. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To optimize model parameters, water quality data from 93 lakes in South Korea were collected and analyzed. Among the 93 lakes, 30 problematic lakes were selected as study sites. Correlation analysis using Chl-a and other water quality data were conducted, and the results indicated that electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity are important key parameters, which are less considerable than in previous research. To verify effectiveness of the selected parameters, one-month forward prediction of Chl-a concentration was performed using water quality data from the most problematic lakes in South Korea. Artificial neural networks were used as a prediction model. The results of Chl-a prediction using selected parameters showed higher accuracy compare to using general parameters based on the literature reviews. EC and turbidity are important parameters, showing high correlation with Chl-a.

224,Seasonal forecasting for decision support in marine fisheries and aquaculture,"The production of marine protein from fishing and aquaculture is influenced by environmental conditions. Ocean temperature, for example, can change the growth rate of cultured animals, or the distribution of wild stocks. In turn these impacts may require changes in fishing or farming practices. In addition to short-term environmental fluctuations, long-term climate-related trends are also resulting in new conditions, necessitating adjustment in fishing, farming and management approaches. Longer-term climate forecasts, however, are seen as less relevant by many in the seafood sector owing to more immediate concerns. Seasonal forecasts provide insight into upcoming environmental conditions, and thus allow improved decision making. Forecasts based on dynamic ocean models are now possible and offer improved performance relative to statistical forecasts, particularly given baseline shifts in the environment as a result of climate change. Seasonal forecasting is being used in marine farming and fishing operations in Australia, including wild tuna and farmed salmon and prawns, to reduce uncertainty and manage business risks. Forecast variables include water temperature, rainfall and air temperature, and are considered useful up to approximately 4months into the future, depending on the region and season of interest. Species-specific habitat forecasts can also be made by combining these environment forecasts with biological habitat preference data. Seasonal forecasts are useful when a range of options are available for implementation in response to the forecasts. The use of seasonal forecasts in supporting effective marine management may also represent a useful stepping stone to improved decision making and industry resilience at longer timescales.",https://doi.org/10.1111/fog.12083,"Hobday, AJ; Spillman, CM; Eveson, JP; Hartog, JR",2016,Article,Fish Oceanogr.,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,review,NA
115,Deployment of artificial neural network for short-term forecasting of evapotranspiration using public weather forecast restricted messages,"Near-future irrigation demand forecasting is important information for anticipating decisions on crop irrigation scheduling and planning water allocation in large irrigation command areas of Texas. The key determinant that is required for estimating irrigation demand in advance is toward the evapotranspiration forecast. Normally, in rich data environment, current reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is estimated by the well-known FAO56 PM method which requires bunch of observed climatic data. In poor data environment for either current or future estimation, this well-known method application is restricted. Indeed, the correctness of ETo forecast remains a challenging computational task, since inaccurate weather variables can alter the forecast accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to employ artificial neural network (ANN) methodology for forecasting near future ETo values by using restricted climate information messages retrieved from public weather forecast source. Four ANNs learning algorithms including the Generalized Feedforward (GFF), Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) are applied with three sets of inputs combination composed of minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) daily air temperatures, extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) and net solar radiation (Rs) to forecast ETo in Dallas. The coefficient of correlation (CC), mean square error (MSE), normalized mean square error (NMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error skill score (MSESS) were used for the models evaluation. Statistically, in comparison with FA056 PM, the performances of ANNs models using only Tmax and Tmin predictors were inferior to those of Tmax, Tmin and Ra. With Tmax, Tmin and Rs input-sets, MLP yielded the highest accuracies (CC= 0.926; MSE= 0.770 mm/day, NMSE= 0.143 mm/day; MAE= 0.708 mm/day). Tmax is an important ETo forecast predictor, and the performance improvement relies mostly on Rs accuracy. With precise weather forecast information, ANN made ETo forecast possible (Average CC= 0.860, MSESS = 0.738). These results can assist irrigation districts to accommodate in advance their crop water demand to near-future irrigation requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier ay.

306,Estimating wheat yield by integrating the WheatGrow and PROSAIL models,"Coupling remote sensing data with crop models is an important way to predict crop yield on a regional scale. Here, we developed a method for wheat yield forecasting based on integrating a wheat growth model (WheatGrow) with a radiative transfer model (PROSAIL). Based on the assimilation algorithm, the PROSAIL model was joined to the coupling model, integrating the remote sensing (RS) and growth models. Wheat VIs (vegetation indices) from different growth periods, which were obtained by fusing high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution images, were used for coupling parameters. Moreover, a LUT (look-up table) was developed between VIs and the measured management parameters (sowing date, sowing rate and nitrogen rate) based on the coupling model. Management parameters including sowing date, sowing rate and nitrogen rate, which are difficult to accurately obtain, were then inverted at the regional scale. Reducing the uncertainty from the input parameters of the WheatGrow model, such as management parameters, improved the accuracy of regional-scale yield prediction. We also used measured data from different years and different ecological sites to determine the optimum coupling VI and coupling frequency based on the integration of RS and crop models. The results show that (1) the three-band VI R-Nir/(R-Red + R-Green) and the two-band VI SAVI (R-Nir,R-Red) are the best coupling VIs; (2) the heading or anthesis stage is the best coupling stage if only one RS image is available; (3) good prediction accuracy can be achieved if three to four high spatial and temporal resolution images from the late jointing to initial filling stages are assimilated. In the study areas, the spatial and temporal distribution of winter wheat growth and productivity parameters were well simulated. The RRMSE of leaf area index and leaf nitrogen accumulation between predicted and measured values were 17.8% and 20.3%, respectively, and the RRMSE of grain yield were less than 10%. The results of this study provide an important theoretical and technical foundation for monitoring and estimating winter wheat growth status on a regional scale and can be extended to other types of crops from varied ecological regions.

185,Short-term forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith model and public weather forecasts,"Short-term daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts are required to facilitate real-time irrigation decision making. We forecasted daily 7-day-ahead ETo using the Penman-Monteith (PM) model and public weather forecasts. Public weather forecast data, including daily maximum and minimum temperatures, weather types and wind scales, for six stations located in a wide range of climate zones of China were collected. Weather types and wind scales were converted to sunshine duration and wind speed to forecast ETo. Meanwhile, daily meteorological data for the same period and locations were collected to calculate ETo, which served as reference standard for evaluating forecasting performance. The results showed that the forecasting performance for the minimum temperature was the best, followed by maximum temperature, sunshine duration and wind speed. Also, it was found that using public weather forecasts and the PM model improved the forecasting performance of daily ETo compared to those obtained when using the HS model with temperature forecasts as the only input data, and this improvement was because the weather type and wind scale forecasts also have positive influence on ETo forecasting. Further, the greatest impact on ETo forecasting error was found to be caused by the errors in sunshine duration and wind speed, followed by maximum and minimum temperature forecasts.

285,Forecast model of allergenic hazard using trends of Poaceae airborne pollen over an urban area in SW Iberian Peninsula (Europe),"Cities are becoming bigger, being necessary the knowledge of associated natural hazards from organic and inorganic aerosols. This hazard could be included in the context of urban air pollution and climate change as environmental risk factors for allergy. Overall, grass pollens are the most important cause of pollinosis in Europe due to its high allergenicity and extensive distribution. The main objective of this work was to model daily average Poaceae airborne pollen concentrations from an urban area placed in a city in the SW of the Iberian Peninsula, taking into account the temporal distribution of five different meteorological variables from 23 years of continuous recording. This was achieved using a combination with the Shuffle Complex Evolution Metropolis Algorithm using as an optimisation function the root mean square error. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from 1993 to 2015 in Badajoz (SW Spain) using a 7-day Hirst-type volumetric sampler. The Poaceae Main Pollen Season lasted, on average, 89 days, ranging from 41 to 144 days, from April 17 to July 14. The model proposed to forecast airborne pollen concentrations is described by one equation composed of two terms. The first term represents the resilience of the pollen concentration trend in the air according to the average concentration of the previous 10 days, and the second term is obtained from considering the actual pollen concentration value, which is calculated based on the most representative meteorological variables multiplied by a fitting coefficient. The fit of the model was examined for a forecast horizon of 1, 7, 15 and 30 days. The R (2) values obtained were 0.70, 0.69, 0.62 and 0.57, respectively, which show a trend in decreasing order.

23,Assessing satellite sea surface salinity from ocean color radiometric measurements for coastal hydrodynamic model data assimilation,"Improving forecasts of salinity from coastal hydrodynamic models would further our predictive capacity of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the coastal ocean. However, salinity is difficult to estimate in coastal and estuarine waters at the temporal and spatial resolution required. Retrieving sea surface salinity (SSS) using satellite ocean color radiometry may provide estimates with reasonable accuracy and resolution for coastal waters that could be assimilated into hydrodynamic models to improve SSS forecasts. We evaluated the applicability of satellite SSS retrievals from two algorithms for potential assimilation into National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS) hydrodynamic model. Of the two satellite algorithms, a generalized additive model (GAM) outperformed that of an artificial neural network (ANN), with mean bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.27 and 3.71 for the GAM and 3.44 and 5.01 for the ANN. However, the RMSE for the SSS predicted by CBOFS (2.47) was lower than that of both satellite algorithms. Given the better precision of the CBOFS model, assimilation of satellite ocean color SSS retrievals will not improve CBOFS forecasts of SSS in Chesapeake Bay. The bias in the GAM SSS retrievals suggests that adding a variable related to precipitation may improve its performance. (C) The Authors.

215,"Assessing the Role of Environmental Factors on Baltic Cod Recruitment, a Complex Adaptive System Emergent Property","For decades, fish recruitment has been a subject of intensive research with stock-recruitment models commonly used for recruitment prediction often only explaining a small fraction of the inter-annual recruitment variation. The use of environmental information to improve our ability to predict recruitment, could contribute considerably to fisheries management. However, the problem remains difficult because the mechanisms behind such complex relationships are often poorly understood; this in turn, makes it difficult to determine the forecast estimation robustness, leading to the failure of some relationships when new data become available. The utility of machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) for solving complex problems has been demonstrated in aquatic studies and has led many researchers to advocate ANNs as an attractive, non-linear alternative to traditional statistical methods. The goal of this study is to design a Baltic cod recruitment model (FishANN) that can account for complex ecosystem interactions. To this end, we (1) build a quantitative model representation of the conceptual understanding of the complex ecosystem interactions driving Baltic cod recruitment dynamics, and (2) apply the model to strengthen the current capability to project future changes in Baltic cod recruitment. FishANN is demonstrated to bring multiple stressors together into one model framework and estimate the relative importance of these stressors while interpreting the complex non-linear interactions between them.

In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to simulate the pore water salinity of a tidal floodplain in Florida. We present an approach based on embedding theory with mutual information to reconstruct ANN model input time series from one system state variable. Mutual information between system output and input was computed and the local minimum mutual information points were used to determine a time lag vector for time series embedding and reconstruction, with which the mutual information weighted average method was developed to compute the components of reconstructed time series. The optimal embedding dimension was obtained by optimizing model performance. The method was applied to simulate soil pore water salinity dynamics at 12 probe locations in the tidal floodplain influenced by saltwater intrusion using 4 years (2005-2008) data, in which adjacent river water salinity was used to reconstruct model input. The simulated electrical conductivity of the pore water showed close agreement with field observations (RMSE <= 0.031 S/m and R-2 >= 0.897), suggesting the reconstructed input by the proposed approach provided adequate input information for ANN modeling.

161,Quercus long-term pollen season trends in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula,"It is widely accepted the influence of meteorology to airborne pollen distribution, this concern is clearly affected by the issue of climate change. In the SW of Iberian Peninsula pollen from Quercus species is often the most abundant in the air and their flowering phenology show changes in seasonal pollination affected by meteorological parameters. This study aims to investigate airborne pollen data of Quercus from a city on the SW Iberian Peninsula over a 20 year period and to analyse the trends in these data and their relationship with meteorological parameters using time series analysis and propose a predictable model to forecast their concentration. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from 1994 to 2013 in Badajoz (SW Spain) using a 7-day Burkard spore trap. The main pollen season for Quercus pollen lasted, on average, 59 days, ranging from 31 to 80 days, from 28th March to 27th May. The model proposed to forecast the airborne pollen concentration is described by Eq. (1). This expression is composed of two terms: the first term represents the resilience of the pollen concentration trend in the air according to the average concentration of the previous 10 days; the second term is obtained from considerations of the actual pollen concentration value, which is calculated based on the most representative climatic variables multiplied by a fitting coefficient.

448,"Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation using the DREAM software package: Theory, concepts, and MATLAB implementation","Bayesian inference has found widespread application and use in science and engineering to reconcile Earth system models with data, including prediction in space (interpolation), prediction in time (forecasting), assimilation of observations and deterministic/stochastic model out ut, and inference of the model parameters. Bayes theorem states that the posterior probability, p(H vertical bar(Y) over tilde) of a hypothesis, H is proportional to the product of the prior probability, p(H) of this hypothesis an the likelihood, L(H vertical bar(Y) over tilde) of the same hypothesis given the new observations, (Y) over tilde, or p(H vertical bar(Y) over tilde)proportional to p(H)L(H vertical bar(Y) over tilde). In science and engineering, H often constitutes some numerical model F(x) which summarizes, in algebraic and differential equations, state variables and fluxes, all knowledge of the system of interest, and the unknown parameter values, x are subject to inference using the data vertical bar(Y)over tilde>. Unfortunately, for complex system models the posterior distribution is often high dimensional and analytically intractable, and sampling methods are required to approximate the target. In this paper I review the basic theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and introduce a MATLAB toolbox of the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm developed by Vrugt at al. (2008a, 2009a) and used for Bayesian inference in fields ranging from physics, chemistry and engineering, to ecology, hydrology, and geophysics. This MATLAB toolbox provides scientists and engineers with an arsenal of options and utilities to solve posterior sampling problems involving (among others) bimodality, high-dimensionality, summary statistics, bounded parameter spaces, dynamic simulation models, formal/informal likelihood functions (GLUE), diagnostic model evaluation, data assimilation, Bayesian model averaging, distributed computation, and informative/non-informative prior distributions. The DREAM toolbox supports parallel computing and includes tools for convergence analysis of the sampled chain trajectories and post-processing of the results. Seven different case studies illustrate the main capabilities and functionalities of the MATLAB toolbox. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

372,Development of a Coupled Spatiotemporal Algal Bloom Model for Coastal Areas: A Remote Sensing and Data Mining-Based Approach,"We developed and successfully applied data-driven models that heavily rely on readily available remote sensing datasets to investigate probabilities of algal bloom occurrences in Kuwait Bay. An artificial neural network (ANN) model, a multivariate regression (MR) model, and a spatiotemporal hybrid model were constructed, optimized, and validated. Temporal and spatial submodels were coupled in a hybrid modeling framework to improve on the predictive powers of conventional ANN and MR generic models. Sixteen variables (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll a OC3M, chlorophyll a Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP), chlorophyll a Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM), precipitation, CDOM, turbidity index, PAR, euphotic depth, Secchi depth, wind direction, wind speed, bathymetry, distance to nearest river outlet, distance to shore, and distance to aquaculture) were used as inputs for the spatial submodel; all of these, with the exception of bathymetry, distance to nearest river outlet, distance to shore, and distance to aquaculture were used for the temporal submodel as well. Findings include: 1) the ANN model performance exceeded that of the MR model and 2) the hybrid models improved the model performance significantly; 3) the temporal variables most indicative of the timing of bloom propagation are sea surface temperature, Secchi disk depth, wind direction, chlorophyll a (OC3M), and wind speed; and 4) the spatial variables most indicative of algal bloom distribution are the ocean chlorophyll from OC3M, GSM, and the GIOP products; distance to shore; and SST. The adopted methodologies are reliable, cost-effective and could be used to forecast algal bloom occurrences in data-scarce regions.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2555898,"Elkadiri, R; Manche, C; Sultan, M; Al-Dousari, A; Uddin, S; Chouinard, K; Abotalib, AZ",2016,Article,IEEE J.

330,Research on algae blooms forecasting based on the multivariate data driven method: a case study of the Chaohu Lake,"The data driven is one of the main methods for forecasting algae bloom, which requires lots of continuous and accurate monitoring data. It is an effective way to increase sample data size by combining in-situ, and remote sensing data. The Chaohu Lake was taken as the case study. Based on water quality data (TLI), meteorological data (sunshine duration, temperature, wind speed, wind direction) and bloom grade data, provided respectively by remote sensing and in-situ monitoring, an artificial neural network was employed to build empirical data-driven models. The model accuracy was evaluated by algae bloom grade recognition rate and bloom trend recognition rate. The results showed that the bloom grade recognition rate of model driven by remote sensing data was better than others. Bloom trend recognition rate of model driven by in-situ data is higher than others. These results provide some insights for algae bloom forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/46/1/012044,"Xiang, B; Zhao, YC; Wang, XY; Zong, X",2016,Proceedings Paper,IOP Conf. Ser.

392,Modeling the transport pathways of harmful algal blooms in the Iberian coast,"The prediction of the path of harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the coast can be achieved using numerical models of ocean circulation in order to reproduce the hydrodynamics of the study area. With this setting, our work aimed at the (1) study of key past events to evaluate the model ability to reproduce the transport pathways of blooms along the Iberian coast, and (2) to assess the relevance of such strictly physical approach. The simulations described here rely on the advection of lagrangian elements after a point release in a hypothetical location for bloom initiation, and the subsequent assessment of the influence of the surface currents transport on the extent of the bloom. Five events were simulated, accounting for blooms of Gymnodinium catenatum, Dinophysis acuminata and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Model results were compared with field data from the National HAB monitoring program, and were used to evaluate some hypothesis in their interpretation. The effort compiled in this paper, though focused on the transport and dispersion of HAB (after bloom detection), was a critical step toward an integrative forecasting system to determine potential HAB impacted areas, also addressed in this Special Issue.

220,Information leverage in interconnected ecosystems: Overcoming the curse of dimensionality,"In ecological analysis, complexity has been regarded as an obstacle to overcome. Here we present a straightforward approach for addressing complexity in dynamic interconnected systems. We show that complexity, in the form of multiple interacting components, can actually be an asset for studying natural systems from temporal data. The central idea is that multidimensional time series enable system dynamics to be reconstructed from multiple viewpoints, and these viewpoints can be combined into a single model. We show how our approach, multiview embedding (MVE), can improve forecasts for simulated ecosystems and a mesocosm experiment. By leveraging complexity, MVE is particularly effective for overcoming the limitations of short and noisy time series and should be highly relevant for many areas of science.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aag0863,"Ye, H; Sugihara, G",2016,Article,Science,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
240,Prediction skill and predictability of Eurasian snow cover fraction in the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2 reforecasts,"Eurasian snow cover fraction (SCF) prediction is analyzed using the recently developed National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) monthly retrospective forecasts for 1983-2009. The CFSv2 is generally capable of reproducing the observed Eurasian SCF seasonal cycle and climatology. This study focuses on the prediction skill and predictability of Eurasian SCF in snowmelt and snowfall seasons because the intensive variability occurs in the two seasons. The CFSv2 reasonably predicts the interannual variations, long-term trend and leading pattern in snowmelt season several months ahead. In comparison with the snowmelt season, the CFSv2 shows a better prediction skill in climatological values but a worse skill in the interannual variability in snowfall season. In addition, the forecasted downward trend of SCF in the snowfall season is opposite to that in the observation. The biases of Eurasian SCF in the snowmelt and snowfall seasons are significantly related with those of temperature and precipitation in the CFSv2. The forecasted cooler and wetter atmosphere is suggestive of the overestimation of the mean SCF. Meanwhile, the underestimation in the variability of both temperature and precipitation in the CFSv2 may be the important factor for the underestimated variability of SCF, especially for the damped variability of SCF in the snowfall season. Generally, the CFSv2 shows a higher and more stable prediction skill after late-1990s than before in the two seasons. The change in the initial condition in the CFSv2 and the observed SCF in late-1990s might be the plausible reason for it.",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.4618,"He, Q; Zuo, ZY; Zhang, RH; Yang, S; Wang, WQ; Zhang, RN; Riddle, EE",2016,Article,Int.

309,Detecting failure of climate predictions,"The practical consequences of climate change challenge society to formulate responses that are more suited to achieving long-term objectives, even if those responses have to be made in the face of uncertainty(1,2). Such a decision-analytic focus uses the products of climate science as probabilistic predictions about the effects of management policies(3). Here we present methods to detect when climate predictions are failing to capture the system dynamics. For a single model, we measure goodness of fit based on the empirical distribution function, and define failure when the distribution of observed values significantly diverges from the modelled distribution. For a set of models, the same statistic can be used to provide relative weights for the individual models, and we define failure when there is no linear weighting of the ensemble models that produces a satisfactory match to the observations. Early detection of failure of a set of predictions is important for improving model predictions and the decisions based on them. We show that these methods would have detected a range shift in northern pintail 20 years before it was actually discovered, and are increasingly giving more weight to those climate models that forecast a September ice-free Arctic by 2055.",https://doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE3041,"Runge, MC; Stroeve, JC; Barrett, AP; McDonald-Madden, E",2016,Article,Nat.

202,Analog forecasting with dynamics-adapted kernels,"Analog forecasting is a nonparametric technique introduced by Lorenz in 1969 which predicts the evolution of states of a dynamical system (or observables defined on the states) by following the evolution of the sample in a historical record of observations which most closely resembles the current initial data. Here, we introduce a suite of forecasting methods which improve traditional analog forecasting by combining ideas from kernel methods developed in harmonic analysis and machine learning and state-space reconstruction for dynamical systems. A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog forecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local similarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent features designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate maps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial observations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field generating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel methods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative strategies based on the Nystrom method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids technique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a low-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic metastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of a comprehensive climate model. We find that forecasts based on kernel-weighted ensembles have significantly higher skill than the conventional approach following a single analog.",https://doi.org/10.1088/0951-7715/29/9/2888,"Zhao, ZZ; Giannakis, D",2016,Article,Nonlinearity,English,mary lofton,NA,1,0,1,NA,,,NA
63,The heated condensation framework as a convective trigger in the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2,"An updated version of the Heated Condensation Framework (HCF) is implemented as a convective triggering criterion into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). The new trigger replaces the original criteria in both the deep (Simplified Arakawa-Schubert - SAS) and shallow (SAS based) convective schemes. The performance of the original and new triggering criteria is first compared against radiosonde observations. Then, a series of hindcasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the triggering criterion in the CFSv2 representation of summer precipitation, the diurnal cycle of precipitation, and hurricanes that made landfall. The observational analysis shows that the HCF trigger better captures the frequency of convection, where the original SAS trigger initiates convection too often. When implemented in CFSv2, the HCF trigger improves the seasonal forecast of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, including the representation of the onset dates of the rainy season over India. On the other hand, the HCF trigger increases error in the seasonal forecast of precipitation over the eastern United States. The HCF trigger also improves the representation of the intensity of hurricanes. Moreover, the simulation of hurricanes provides insights on the mechanism whereby the HCF trigger impacts the representation of convection.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016MS000668,"Bombardi, RJ; Tawfik, AB; Manganello, JV; Marx, L; Shin, CS; Halder, S; Schneider, EK; Dirmeyer, PA; Kinter, JL",2016,Article,J.

302,Benefits and costs of controlling three allergenic alien species under climate change and dispersal scenarios in Central Europe,"Climate change is likely to exacerbate the negative effects of invasive alien species (IAS) as it will foster their further spread. This paper analyses the potential socio-economic effects of three emerging IAS (giant ragweed, Ambrosia trifida; annual wormwood, Artemisia annua; and burweed marshelder, Iva xanthiifolia), which are known to cause substantial harm to human health and to have negative effects on agricultural production. The novelty of the study consists in an integrated approach that combines several aspects of IAS research and management. We model the future spread of the study species in Central Europe by the year 2050 under several climate change, management and spread scenarios. The costs and benefits of controlling the expansion of these IAS are based on this forecast. The results show that an early and coordinated response to the spread of these IAS yields substantial net benefits under all scenarios. Under the conditions of moderate climate change (+1.5 degrees C), discounted net benefits range from (sic)19 to (sic)582 million. Assuming more severe climate change (+2.4 degrees C), total savings over the full period are projected to add up to (sic)1063 million. These large socio-economic benefits provide compelling evidence that public authorities should act preventively to restrict the spread of these three IAS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

236,Can Recent Global Changes Explain the Dramatic Range Contraction of an Endangered Semi-Aquatic Mammal Species in the French Pyrenees?,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are the main tool to predict global change impacts on species ranges. Climate change alone is frequently considered, but in freshwater ecosystems, hydrology is a key driver of the ecology of aquatic species. At large scale, hydrology is however rarely accounted for, owing to the lack of detailed stream flow data. In this study, we developed an integrated modelling approach to simulate stream flow using the hydrological Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Simulated stream flow was subsequently included as an input variable in SDMs along with topographic, hydrographic, climatic and land-cover descriptors. SDMs were applied to two temporally-distinct surveys of the distribution of the endangered Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) in the French Pyrenees: a historical one conducted from 1985 to 1992 and a current one carried out between 2011 and 2013. The model calibrated on historical data was also forecasted onto the current period to assess its ability to describe the distributional change of the Pyrenean desman that has been modelled in the recent years. First, we found that hydrological and climatic variables were the ones influencing the most the distribution of this species for both periods, emphasizing the importance of taking into account hydrology when SDMs are applied to aquatic species. Secondly, our results highlighted a strong range contraction of the Pyrenean desman in the French Pyrenees over the last 25 years. Given that this range contraction was under-estimated when the historical model was forecasted onto current conditions, this finding suggests that other drivers may be interacting with climate, hydrology and land-use changes. Our results imply major concerns for the conservation of this endemic semi-aquatic mammal since changes in climate and hydrology are expected to become more intense in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159941,"Charbonnel, A; Laffaille, P; Biffi, M; Blanc, F; Maire, A; Nemoz, M; Sanchez-Perez, JM; Sauvage, S; Buisson, L",2016,Article,PLoS One,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
46,EVALUATING THE CONTRIBUTING ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH EUTROPHICATION IN A SHALLOW LAKE BY APPLYING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS TECHNIQUES,"Eutrophication is a serious problem that affects water quality and it may cause Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) events with many unpleasant consequences. For that purpose, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed able to forecast one month ahead the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels and by that way to act as a warning tool when a HAB event might follow. Sampling data from eleven monitoring stations were collected from Lake Pamvotis (Greece), a shallow hypereutrophic lake, affected by HABs. The created ANN managed with high accuracy to simulate the next month's Chl-a concentration, establishing it as a reliable predictor that represents well the non-linear relationships between the Chl-a and the environmental parameters. The significance of each environmental parameter associated with eutrophication was also examined. Focusing on the contribution of the environmental parameters three different methods that give the ANN model sensitivity are applied: (i) the 'Perturb' method; (ii) the 'Weights' method; (iii) the `PaD' ('Partial Derivatives') method. A combined parameter importance index was introduced, in order to overcome the computational differences resulted from the three methods.

87,Global marine biogeochemical reanalyses assimilating two different sets of merged ocean colour products,"The only observations of marine biogeochemistry with routine global coverage are satellite ocean colour, which provide measurements of ocean bio-optical properties, with coverage still incomplete and limited to the sea surface. Models are therefore required to provide full spatial coverage, and through data assimilation can be combined with observations to create a reanalysis. This can then be used to investigate both observed and non observed variables, including those relating to the carbon cycle. As part of the Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG) within the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, two global marine biogeochemical reanalyses have been produced by assimilating ocean colour-derived chlorophyll data into a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model over the period September 1997 to July 2012. One reanalysis assimilated CCI products, the other assimilated GlobColour products, with a non-assimilative hindcast run for comparison. Each has been validated against independent in situ observations of chlorophyll, nutrients and carbon cycle variables. The assimilation of either source of ocean colour data was found to improve the model's representation of chlorophyll concentration throughout the water column, including the frequency and positioning of deep chlorophyll maxima. The assimilation also resulted in a slight improvement in nutrient concentrations and surface fugacity of carbon dioxide compared with in situ observations, although the overall impact on mean fields was small. This was found to be due in part to cancelling errors within the model, with the assimilation providing information on model biases, which can be used to inform future climate model development. The reanalyses were also able to reproduce expected seasonal cycles, as well as inter-annual variability related to major climate drivers. This study concludes that both CCI and GlobColour products are suitable for assimilation purposes, and that assimilating ocean colour data is of clear benefit.

193,"Short-term forecasting of cyanobacteria blooms in Yuqiao reservoir, China","Agriculture fertilizers and untreated sewage in the catchment of freshwater bodies increase their nutrient concentrations. The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set. The calibration and validation results are presented for water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration at the measurement dates. The short-term forecast modelling is performed for temperature and cyanobacteria over a 5-day ahead period.

The entropy weight method was employed to determine the weight coefficient for each individual model depending on its predictive performance. Results showed that: (1) ANN exhibits the highest fitting capability among the four forecasting models in the calibration period, whilst its generalization ability becomes weak in the validation period; MLR has a poor performance in both calibration and validation periods; the predicted results of CFM in the calibration period have the highest stability; (2) CFM generally outperforms all individual models in the validation period, and can improve the reliability and stability of predicted results through combining the strengths while reducing the weaknesses of individual models; (3) the performances of all forecasting models are better in dense vegetation areas than in sparse vegetation areas.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1692-8,"Huang, SZ; Ming, B; Huang, Q; Leng, GY; Hou, BB",2017,Article,Water Resour.

364,Early warning of limit-exceeding concentrations of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in drinking water reservoirs by inferential modelling,"An early warning scheme is proposed that runs ensembles of inferential models for predicting the cyanobacterial population dynamics and cyanotoxin concentrations in drinking water reservoirs on a diet basis driven by in situ sonde water quality data. When the 10- to 30-day-ahead predicted concentrations of cyanobacteria cells or cyanotoxins exceed pre-defined limit values, an early warning automatically activates an action plan considering in-lake control, e.g. intermittent mixing and ad hoc water treatment in water works, respectively. Case studies of the sub-tropical Lake Wivenhoe (Australia) and the Mediterranean Vaal Reservoir (South Africa) demonstrate that ensembles of inferential models developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA are capable of up to 30 days forecasts of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins using data collected in situ. The resulting models for Dolicospermum circinale displayed validity for up to 10 days ahead, whilst concentrations of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and microcystins were successfully predicted up to 30 days ahead. Implementing the proposed scheme for drinking water reservoirs enhances current water quality monitoring practices by solely utilising in situ monitoring data, in addition to cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin measurements. Access to routinely measured cyanotoxin data allows for development of models that predict explicitly cyanotoxin concentrations that avoid to inadvertently model and predict non-toxic cyanobacterial strains.

272,A novel single-parameter approach for forecasting algal blooms,"Harmful algal blooms frequently occur globally, and forecasting could constitute an essential proactive strategy for bloom control. To decrease the cost of aquatic environmental monitoring and increase the accuracy of bloom forecasting, a novel single-parameter approach combining wavelet analysis with artificial neural networks (WNN) was developed and verified based on daily online monitoring datasets of algal density in the Siling Reservoir, China and Lake Winnebago, U.S.A. Firstly, a detailed modeling process was illustrated using the forecasting of cyanobacterial cell density in the Chinese reservoir as an example. Three WNN models occupying various prediction time intervals were optimized through model training using an early stopped training approach. All models performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial cell density, with the best model predicting cyanobacteria density one-day ahead (r = 0.986 and mean absolute error = 0.103 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)). Secondly, the potential of this novel approach was further confirmed by the precise predictions of algal biomass dynamics measured as chl a in both study sites, demonstrating its high performance in forecasting algal blooms, including cyanobacteria as well as other blooming species. Thirdly, the WNN model was compared to current algal forecasting methods (i.e. artificial neural networks, autoregressive integrated moving average model), and was found to be more accurate. In addition, the application of this novel single-parameter approach is cost effective as it requires only a buoy-mounted fluorescent probe, which is merely a fraction (-15%) of the cost of a typical auto-monitoring system. As such, the newly developed approach presents a promising and cost-effective tool for the future prediction and management of harmful algal blooms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

296,Forecasting the Seasonal Timing of Maine's Lobster Fishery,"The fishery for American lobster is currently the highest-valued commercial fishery in the United States, worth over US$620 million in dockside value in 2015. During a marine heat wave in 2012, the fishery was disrupted by the early warming of spring ocean temperatures and subsequent influx of lobster landings. This situation resulted in a price collapse, as the supply chain was not prepared for the early and abundant landings of lobsters. Motivated by this series of events, we have developed a forecast of when the Maine (USA) lobster fishery will shift into its high volume summer landings period. The forecast uses a regression approach to relate spring ocean temperatures derived from four NERACOOS buoys along the coast of Maine to the start day of the high landings period of the fishery. Tested against conditions in past years, the forecast is able to predict the start day to within 1 week of the actual start, and the forecast can be issued 3-4 months prior to the onset of the high landings period, providing valuable lead-time for the fishery and its associated supply chain to prepare for the upcoming season. Forecast results are conveyed in a probabilistic manner and are updated weekly over a 6-week forecasting period so that users can assess the certainty and consistency of the forecast and factor the uncertainty into their use of the information in a given year. By focusing on the timing of events, this type of seasonal forecast provides climate-relevant information to users at time scales that are meaningful for operational decisions. As climate change alters seasonal phenology and reduces the reliability of past experience as a guide for future expectations, this type of forecast can enable fishing industry participants to better adjust to and prepare for operating in the context of climate change.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00337,"Mills, KE; Pershing, AJ; Hernandez, CM",2017,Article,Front.

We investigated the climatic drivers of demographic fluctuations in a forest tree defoliator, the pine pro cessionary moth (PPM), in 8 biogeographical regions in France. We studied the effects of precipitation and temperature for both cold and warm periods, in accordance with PPM biology. We trained second-order log linear models of infestation dynamics based on records spanning over 32 years (1981-2014) and 1239 forest plots, and tested their forecast accuracy on two additional years (2013-2014). PPM population growth rate decreased with higher precipitations in 5 regions and increased with increasing temperatures in the cold period in 4 regions. The magnitude and direction of temperature effects in the warm period varied among biogeographical regions. Our results also revealed that PPM population dynamics were largely triggered by density-dependent factors independent from climatic drivers. Short-term forecasts were generally accurate irrespective of the inclusion of climatic variables into the models. To better predict the consequences of climate change on insect population dynamics, it is advisable to take geographical variability of species response into account and develop regional forecasting models.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.08.024,"Toigo, M; Barraquand, F; Barnagaud, JY; Piou, D; Jactel, H",2017,Article,For.

59,Gene-Expression Programming for Short-Term Forecasting of Daily Reference Evapotranspiration Using Public Weather Forecast Information,"This study aimed to forecast the daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using a gene-expression programming (GEP) algorithm with limited public weather forecast information over Gaoyou station, located in Jiangsu province, China. To calibrate and validate the gene-expression code, important meteorological data and weather forecast information were collected from the local meteorological station and public weather media, respectively. The GEP algebraic formulation was successfully constructed based only on daily minimum and maximum air temperature using the true FAO56 Penman-Monteith (PM) set as reference values. The performance of the models was then assessed using the correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), root relative squared error (RRSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The study demonstrated that GEP is able to calibrate ETo (all errors <= 0.990 mm/day, R = 0.832-0.866) and forecast the daily ETo with good accuracy (RMSE = 1.207 mm/day, MAE = 0.902 mm/day, RRSE = 0.629 mm/day, R = 0.777). The model accuracies slightly decreased over a 7-day forecast lead-time. These results suggest that the GEP algorithm can be considered as a deployable tool for ETo forecast to anticipate decision on short-term irrigation schedule in the study zone.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1784-5,"Traore, S; Luo, YF; Fipps, G",2017,Article,Water Resour.

258,Response of Microcystis and Stephanodiscus to Alternative Flow Regimes of the Regulated River Nakdong (South Korea) Quantified By Model Ensembles Based on the Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA),"This study demonstrates the use of inferential models for scenario analyses by simulating direct and indirect effects of predictor variables on state variables through model ensembles. Two model ensembles have been designed to predict the response of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii to modified flow regimes of the River Nakdong (Korea) by a scenario analysis. Whilst flow-independent predictor variables of growth of Microcystis and Stephanodiscus such as water temperature and pH remain unchanged during the scenario analysis, flow-dependent predictor variables such as turbidity, electrical conductivity, phosphate, nitrate, silica and chlorophyll a are forecasted by inferential models. In the course of scenario analysis, flow-independent and flow-dependent predictor variables feed into the Microcystis and Stephanodiscus models to make sure that both direct and indirect effects of altered flow regimes are taken into account. The eight inferential models that were incorporated into the model ensembles have been developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on 19years of time-series monitored in the River Nakdong between 1993 and 2012. The models achieved good accuracy in terms of timing and magnitudes reflected by coefficients of determination r(2)=0.94 for Microcystis and r(2)=0.83 for Stephanodiscus. The scenario analysis revealed that extreme summer blooms of Microcystis as observed between 1994 and 1997, and winter blooms of Stephanodiscus as observed between 1994 and 1997 and in 2004 can be prevented in the River Nakdong by adaptive management of seasonal water release from adjacent dams.

110,Numerical ragweed pollen forecasts using different source maps: a comparison for France,"One of the key input parameters for numerical pollen forecasts is the distribution of pollen sources. Generally, three different methodologies exist to assemble such distribution maps: (1) plant inventories, (2) land use data in combination with annual pollen counts, and (3) ecological modeling. We have used six exemplary maps for all of these methodologies to study their applicability and usefulness in numerical pollen forecasts. The ragweed pollen season of 2012 in France has been simulated with the numerical weather prediction model COSMO-ART using each of the distribution maps in turn. The simulated pollen concentrations were statistically compared to measured values to derive a ranking of the maps with respect to their performance. Overall, approach (2) resulted in the best correspondence between observed and simulated pollen concentrations for the year 2012. It is shown that maps resulting from ecological modeling that does not include a sophisticated estimation of the plant density have a very low predictive skill. For inventory maps and the maps based on land use data and pollen counts, the results depend very much on the observational site. The use of pollen counts to calibrate the map enhances the performance of the model considerably.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-016-1188-x,"Zink, K; Kaufmann, P; Petitpierre, B; Broennimann, O; Guisan, A; Gentilini, E; Rotach, M",2017,Article,Int.

381,How well can the observed Arctic sea ice summer retreat and winter advance be represented in the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2?,"The capability of a numerical model to simulate the statistical characteristics of the summer sea ice date of retreat (DOR) and the winter date of advance (DOA) is investigated using sea ice concentration output from the Climate Forecast System Version 2 model (CFSv2). Two model configurations are tested, the operational setting (CFSv2CFSR) which uses initial data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, and a modified version (CFSv2PIOMp) which ingests sea ice thickness initialization data from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) and includes physics modifications for a more realistic representation of heat fluxes at the sea ice top and bottom. First, a method to define DOR and DOA is presented. Then, DOR and DOA are determined from the model simulations and observational sea ice concentration from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Means, trends, and detrended standard deviations of DOR and DOA are compared, along with DOR/DOA rates in the Arctic Ocean. It is found that the statistics are generally similar between the model and observations, although some regional biases exist. In addition, regions of new ice retreat in recent years are represented well in CFSv2PIOMp over the Arctic Ocean, in terms of both spatial extent and timing. Overall, CFSv2PIOMp shows a reduction in error throughout the Arctic. Based on results, it is concluded that the model produces a reasonable representation of the climatology and variability statistics of DOR and DOA in most regions. This assessment serves as a prerequisite for future predictability experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3417-8,"Collow, TW; Wang, WQ; Kumar, A; Zhang, JL",2017,Article,Clim.

The system integrates Open Modal Analysis (OMA), Short Term Prediction algorithms (STPS) and an oil spill model to simulate oil spill trajectories. A set of 18 buoys was used to assess the accuracy of the system for trajectory forecast and to evaluate the benefits of HF radar data compared to the use of currents from a hydrodynamic model (HDM). The results showed that simulated trajectories using OMA currents were more accurate than those obtained using a HDM. After 481 the mean error was reduced by 40%. The forecast skill of the STPS method was valid up to 6 h ahead.

190,Improved Tropical Modes of Variability in the NCEP Climate Forecast System (Version 2) via a Stochastic Multicloud Model,"A stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) convective parameterization, which mimics the interactions at subgrid scales of multiple cloud types, is incorporated into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), model (CFSsmcm) in lieu of the preexisting simplified Arakawa-Schubert (SAS) cumulus scheme. A detailed analysis of the tropical intraseasonal variability (TISV) and convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEW) in comparison with the original (control) model and with observations is presented here. The last 10 years of a 15-yr-long climate simulation are analyzed. Significant improvements are seen in the simulation of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and most of the CCEWs as well as the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). These improvements appear in the form of improved morphology and physical features of these waves. This can be regarded as a validation of the central idea behind the SMCM according to which organized tropical convection is based on three cloud types, namely, the congestus, deep, and stratiform cloud decks, that interact with each other and form a building block for multiscale convective systems. An adequate accounting of the dynamical interactions of this cloud hierarchy thus constitutes an important requirement for cumulus parameterizations to succeed in representing atmospheric tropical variability. SAS fails to fulfill this requirement, which is evident in the unrealistic physical structures of the major intraseasonal modes simulated by CFSv2 as documented here.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-17-0113.1,"Goswami, BB; Khouider, B; Phani, R; Mukhopadhyay, P; Majda, AJ",2017,Article,J.

239,"Machine Learning Approaches for Cyanobacteria Bloom Prediction using metagenomic sequence data, a case study","Cyanobacteria bloom is a serious public health threat and a global challenge. Literature on the bloom prediction and forecasting has been accumulating and the emphasis appears to have been on the relation between the blooms and environmental factors, whilst the complexity of the bloom mechanism makes it difficult to reach adequate output of the models. Rapid development of next generation sequencing techniques provides a way in which comprehensive and quick examination of the microbial community can be achieved, especially for the bloom community structure. This facilitates using of merely the sequence data along with the machine learning techniques to predict and forecast the bloom occurrence. But there has been rare report on this theme in the literature. In this case study, machine learning approaches were applied with the metagenomic data as the only input (rather than with environmental data) to predict the Cyanobacteria blooms. k-NN classification, SVM classification and k-means clustering were applied and their efficiencies were evaluated using relevant indices. Feature selection was performed and the yielded sub datasets were worked on seriatim. In the predicting experiment with k-NN approach, the final year's data among the 8 years OTU time series were used as target data and various combination of the preceding years' data were used as predictor data; the output came with the best values of 1.00 and 100% for the evaluation indices F1score and sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, for the 7 preceding years' predictor input, among the experiment results. This case study demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning approaches in the Cyanobacteria bloom prediction with only metagenomic sequence data, and the importance of feature selection processing in obtaining better output of the machine learning approaches. The metagenomic data based machine learning approaches are efficient, economic, and faster, possessing the advantage and potential for being adopted as a promising means in the bloom prediction practice.",NA,"Huang, JD; Zheng, HR; Wang, HY; Jiang, XP",2017,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
106,Assimilation of canopy cover and biomass measurements in the crop model AquaCrop,"Measurements indicative of crop development, such as leaf area index, canopy cover or biomass are typically performed only a few times throughout the season at irregular time intervals. Furthermore, due to the inherent spatial variability that exists in the field, combining measurements taken at different locations in the field usually leads to large uncertainty around the mean value. These factors, together with the fact that crop-soil models are strongly non-linear, render assimilation of measurements in crop-soil models non-trivial. This work presents procedures for performing such data assimilation, using the crop model AquaCrop as specific example. The procedures are based on Extended Kalman Filter, with some heuristic adjustments, and enable re-initialisation of state variables and/or adjustments of selected parameters of the model. The uncertainties of the measurements are taken into account explicitly in the proposed assimilation scheme. The procedures were tested with data obtained from experiments conducted with potato in Denmark and cotton in Greece. In both cases the data available consisted of canopy cover and biomass (average and standard deviation on 5-10 days), and a locally calibrated AquaCrop model was used as starting point for the assimilation process. The results demonstrate the soundness of the approach but also emphasise the inherent limitations associated with data assimilation. In particular, assimilation of easy-to-obtain canopy cover measurements did not always improve the predictions of biomass. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

101,A comparison of two adaptive multivariate analysis methods (PLSR and ANN) for winter wheat yield forecasting using Landsat-8 OLI images,"An assumption that the non-linear method is more reasonable than the linear method when canopy reflectance is used to establish the yield prediction model was proposed and tested in this study. For this purpose, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural networks (ANN), represented linear and non-linear analysis method, were applied and compared for wheat yield prediction. Multi-period Landsat-8 OLT images were collected at two different wheat growth stages, and a field campaign was conducted to obtain grain yields at selected sampling sites in 2014. The field data were divided into a calibration database and a testing database. Using calibration data, a cross-validation concept was introduced for the PLSR and ANN model construction to prevent over-fitting. All models were tested using the test data. The ANN yield-prediction model produced R-2, RMSE and RMSE% values of 0.61, 979 kg ha(-1), and 10.38%, respectively, in the testing phase, performing better than the PLSR yield-prediction model, which produced R-2, RMSE, and RMSE% values of 0.39, 1211 kg ha(-1), and 12.84%, respectively. Non-linear method was suggested as a better method for yield prediction. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

174,"Effects of a bio-invasion of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793) in five shallow water habitats in Scandinavia","Management of invasive species is addressed in both national and international regulations regarding the protection of marine habitats and biodiversity and in regulations of aquaculture. The geographical range of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is expanding, both through human mediated vectors and by natural dispersal. The species is now spreading in Scandinavia. In order to optimize the management of the oyster, including targeted monitoring and mitigation activities, knowledge on the present and future distribution and impact on the ecosystem is important. The development of the population and the potential impacts on native ecosystems were analyzed, based on the present scientific knowledge on the distribution in Scandinavia, data on new settlements and existing literature. Data was first evaluated by 14 experts (including the authors) during a workshop, relating the current status of habitats where Pacific oysters are found in Scandinavia (Low energy rock, Littoral sand and mudflats, Littoral biogenic reefs, Sublittoral sand and Sublittoral biogenic reefs) to a predicted development, thereafter assessed in relation to impact on the habitats. The assessment was done as a function of climate change in a longterm IPCC climate scenario (A1B). We conclude that Littoral biogenic reefs are at risk to obtain the highest expected increase, while all other habitats are at risk of low to moderate development of the oyster populations. Accordingly, Littoral Biogenic reefs was assessed as the habitat type at risk of the largest ecosystem effects as high densities of oysters already exist in these areas, and the densities are expected to increase rapidly until reaching a threshold density. Low energy rock and Littoral sand and mud were assessed as being subjected to moderate to high ecosystem effects. Sub-littoral sand and Sub-littoral biogenic reefs were assessed as currently being at risk of moderate ecosystem effects as there are low densities of oysters in these habitats, although densities in sublittoral biogenic reefs has the potential to increase. We discuss management and mitigation strategies based on the forecasted development and effects of the Pacific oyster populations.",https://doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2017.8.4.09,"Mortensen, S; Bodvin, T; Strand, A; Holm, MW; Dolmer, P",2017,Article,Manag.

313,Climate change both facilitates and inhibits invasive plant ranges in New England,"Forecasting ecological responses to climate change, invasion, and their interaction must rely on understanding underlying mechanisms. However, such forecasts require extrapolation into new locations and environments. We linked demography and environment using experimental biogeography to forecast invasive and native species' potential ranges under present and future climate in New England, United States to overcome issues of extrapolation in novel environments. We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants' distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source-sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline. Our results-based on considerable differences with correlative occurrence models typically used for such biogeographic forecasts-suggest the urgency of incorporating mechanism into range forecasting and invasion management to understand how climate change may alter current invasion patterns.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1609633114,"Merow, C; Bois, ST; Allen, JM; Xie, YY; Silander, JA",2017,Article,Proc.

425,Modelling spatiotemporal dynamics of Pinus pinea cone infestation by Dioryctria mendacella,"Insect predation on seeds of forests species during the predispersal phase is a special case of plant-pest interaction in which, while plant survival and growth is not threatened, natural regeneration can be negatively affected. In the case of seeds with a high economic value, as is the case of ""nuts from the Mediterranean stone pine (Pinus pinea L), predispersal predation can also result in severe economic losses. The insect-seed relationship shows complex spatiotemporal dynamics, including patterns of dependency between fruit availability and fluctuations in insect population, occurrence of insect outbreaks, spatial contagion and masting habit. In the present study, we focus on the damage caused by a native pest, the Dioryctria mendacella Stgr. moth, to cones and seeds of P. pinea, a forest species showing a marked masting habit. We firstly identified those environmental and stand-level factors controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of damage by D. mendacella, as well as the self-regulatory effect that interannual variability in seed production could have on the population dynamics of the moth. In a second phase, we constructed a predictive phenomenological model to forecast the probability of cone damage in a given location, as well as the expected patterns of spatiotemporal spread and dispersion. Our results revealed a strong correlation between the probability of damage and crop size in a given year, pointing to a dependency between feeding resources and predator population. Additionally, the probability of damage is affected by the number of damaged cones observed in the previous year, indicating temporal contagion. Cone and seed damage is also affected by the temperature during different phases of the complex life-cycle of D. mendacella, which suggests that breakout processes are synchronized within the territory and linked to the occurrence of bumper crops and favorable climatic conditions. We detected that the level of infestation at a given location is related to site and environmental conditions, with no significant pattern of contagion/spreading from stands with high resource availability to those with low availability. Damage prediction under warmer climate scenarios reveals a counterbalance among favorable/unfavorable conditions for insect expansion and expected decline in cone production, resulting in only slight changes.

293,Multi-Annual Climate Predictions for Fisheries: An Assessment of Skill of Sea Surface Temperature Forecasts for Large Marine Ecosystems,"Decisions made by fishers and fisheries managers are informed by climate and fisheries observations that now often span more than 50 years. Multi-annual climate forecasts could further inform such decisions if they were skillful in predicting future conditions relative to the 50-year scope of past variability. We demonstrate that an existing multi-annual prediction system skillfully forecasts the probability of next year, the next 1-3 years, and the next 1-10 years being warmer or cooler than the 50-year average at the surface in coastal ecosystems. Probabilistic forecasts of upper and lower seas surface temperature (SST) terciles over the next 3 or 10 years from the GFDL CM 2.1 10-member ensemble global prediction system showed significant improvements in skill over the use of a 50-year climatology for most Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) in the North Atlantic, the western Pacific, and Indian oceans. Through a comparison of the forecast skill of initialized and uninitialized hindcasts, we demonstrate that this skill is largely due to the predictable signature of radiative forcing changes over the 50-year timescale rather than prediction of evolving modes of climate variability. North Atlantic LMEs stood out as the only coastal regions where initialization significantly contributed to SST prediction skill at the 1 to 10 year scale.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00201,"Tommasi, D; Stock, CA; Alexander, MA; Yang, XS; Rosati, A; Vecchi, GA",2017,Article,Front.

85,Contemporary Remotely Sensed Data Products Refine Invasive Plants Risk Mapping in Data Poor Regions,"Invasive weeds are a serious problem worldwide, threatening biodiversity and damaging economies. Modeling potential distributions of invasive weeds can prioritize locations for monitoring and control efforts, increasing management efficiency. Forecasts of invasion risk at regional to continental scales are enabled by readily available downscaled climate surfaces together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrence records and species distribution modeling techniques. However, predictions at a finer scale and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Contemporary remote sensing (RS) data can enhance predictions by providing a range of spatial environmental data products at fine scale beyond climatic variables only. In this study, we used the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and empirical maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models to model the potential distributions of 14 invasive plant species across Southeast Asia (SEA), selected from regional and Vietnam's lists of priority weeds. Spatial environmental variables used to map invasion risk included bioclimatic layers and recent representations of global land cover, vegetation productivity (GPP), and soil properties developed from Earth observation data. Results showed that combining climate and RS data reduced predicted areas of suitable habitat compared with models using climate or RS data only, with no loss in model accuracy. However, contributions of RS variables were relatively limited, in part due to uncertainties in the land cover data. We strongly encourage greater adoption of quantitative remotely sensed estimates of ecosystem structure and function for habitat suitability modeling. Through comprehensive maps of overall predicted area and diversity of invasive species, we found that among lifeforms (herb, shrub, and vine), shrub species have higher potential invasion risk in SEA. Native invasive species, which are often overlooked in weed risk assessment, may be as serious a problem as non-native invasive species. Awareness of invasive weeds and their environmental impacts is still nascent in SEA and information is scarce. Freely available global spatial datasets, not least those provided by Earth observation programs, and the results of studies such as this one provide critical information that enables strategic management of environmental threats such as invasive species.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2017.00770,"Truong, TTA; Hardy, GES; Andrew, ME",2017,Article,Front.

76,Ensemble forecasting of Corbicula fluminea worldwide distribution: Projections of the impact of climate change,"Global biodiversity is at risk owing to climate change, and freshwater ecosystems are expected to suffer the most. In recent years niche-based models (NBMs) have been used to predict species distribution and are an important tool for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. In this work, the current and future climatic suitability areas of the invasive species Corbicula fluminea, which has known adverse ecological and economic impacts, were investigated. The species distribution modelling was based on nine algorithms in BIOMOD2, summarized in an ensemble forecasting approach. To model the species distribution, eight climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation variables were considered. Three time frames (current, 2050 and 2070) were modelled using four increasing CO2 emission scenarios. The performance of individual models was excellent according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and good to excellent according to true skill statistics (TSS). Annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important variables predicting C. fluminea occurrence. Of the total continental area, 6.6% was predicted to be suitable for C. fluminea in current conditions. In the future, suitable area will increase from the current value of 6.6% to values from 9.4% to 12.6%, according to the 2050 projections and up to 12.7% in 2070 in high emission scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that climate change will favour the expansion of C. fluminea into new river basins, especially at higher latitudes, and that future climatic scenarios may double the suitable area for Corbicula fluminea.",https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.2767,"Gama, M; Crespo, D; Dolbeth, M; Anastacio, PM",2017,Article,Aquat.

443,Short-term daily forecasting of crop evapotranspiration of rice using public weather forecasts,"Accurate forecasts of daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) are essential for real-time irrigation management and water resource allocation. This paper presents a method for the short-term forecasting of ETc using a single-crop coefficient approach and public weather forecasts. Temperature forecasts with a 7-day lead time in 2013-2015 were retrieved and entered into a calibrated Hargreaves-Samani model to compute daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) forecasts, while crop coefficient (K-c) empirical values were estimated from both observed ETc value and calculated ET0 values using the Penman-Monteith equation for the period of 2010-2012. Daily ETc forecasts of irrigated double-cropping rice were determined for three growing seasons during the period of 2013-2015 and were compared with ETc values measured by the weighing lysimeters at the Jiangxi experimental irrigation station in southeastern China. During the early rice season, the average mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values of ETc forecasts ranged from 0.95 to 1.06 mm day(-1) and from 1.18 to 1.31 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average correlation coefficient (R) ranged from 0.39 to 0.54; for late rice, the average MAE and RMSE values ranged from 1.01 to 1.09 mm day(-1) and from 1.32 to 1.40 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average R value ranged from 0.54 to 0.58. There could be three factors responsible for errors in ETc forecasts, including temperature forecast errors, K-c value errors and neglected meteorological variables in the HS model, including wind speed and relative humidity. In addition, ETc was more sensitive to changes in temperature than K-c. The overall results indicated that it is appropriate to forecast ETc with the proposed model for real-time irrigation management and water resource allocation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10333-018-0633-3,"Li, D; Chen, JY; Luo, YF; Liu, FP; Luo, HY; Xie, HW; Cui, YL",2018,Article,Paddy Water Environ.,English,rachel corrigan,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,daily ET forecasts,NA
386,The Assimilation of Phytoplankton Functional Types for Operational Forecasting in the Northwest European Shelf,"This paper proposes the use of assimilation of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) surface chlorophyll for operational forecasting of biogeochemistry on the North-West European (NWE) Shelf. We explicitly compare the 5-day forecasting skill of three runs of a physical-biogeochemical model: (a) a free reference run, (b) a run with daily data assimilation (DA) of total surface chlorophyll (ChlTot), and (c) a run with daily PFTs DA. We show that small total chlorophyll model bias hides comparatively large biases in PFTs chlorophyll, which ChlTot DA fails to correct. This is because the ChlTot DA splits the assimilated total chlorophyll into PFTs by preserving their simulated ratios, rather than taking account of the observed PFT concentrations. Unlike ChlTot DA, PFTs DA substantially improves model representation of PFTs chlorophyll. During forecasting the DA reanalysis skill in representing PFTs chlorophyll degrades toward the free run skill; however, PFTs DA outperforms free run within the whole 5-day forecasting period. We validated our results with in situ data, and we demonstrated that (in both DA cases) the DA substantially improves the model representation of CO2 fugacity (PFTs DA more than ChlTot DA). ChlTot DA has a positive impact on the representation of silicate, while the PFTs DA seems to have a negative impact. The impact of DA on nitrate and phosphate is not significant. The implications of using a univariate assimilation method, which preserves the phytoplankton stochiometry, and the impact of model biases on the nonassimilated variables are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014153,"Skakala, J; Ford, D; Brewin, RJW; McEwan, R; Kay, S; Taylor, B; de Mora, L; Ciavatta, S",2018,Article,J.

327,"Short-term forecasting of daily crop evapotranspiration using the ""K-c-ETo' approach and public weather forecasts","Short-term forecasting of daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is essential for real-time irrigation management. This study proposed a methodology to forecast short-term daily ETc using the K-c-ETo' approach and public weather forecasts. Daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts were obtained using a locally calibrated version of the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model and temperature forecasts, while the crop coefficient (K-c) was estimated from observed daily ETo and ETc. The methodology was evaluated by comparing the daily ETc forecasts with measured ETc values from a field irrigation experiment during 2012-2014 in Yongkang Irrigation Experimental Station, China. The overall average of the statistical indices was in the range of 0.96-1.27mm d(-1) for the mean absolute error (MAE), 1.53-2.55mm d(-1) for the mean square error (MSE), 1.77-2.30mm d(-1) for the normalized mean square error (NMSE), 27.5-29.4% for the mean relative error (MRE), 0.71-0.44 for the correlation coefficient (R) and 0.46-0.05 for the mean square error skill score (MSESS). Sources of error werewere K-c estion, temperature forecasts and HS model that does not consider wind speed and humidity, and.the largesourceof error is K-c determination, which suggested that care should be taken when forecasting ETc with estimated K-c values in the study area.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2017.1387778,"Zhang, L; Cui, YL; Xiang, Z; Zheng, SZ; Traore, S; Luo, YF",2018,Article,Arch.

212,Climate-driven variability in vegetation greenness over Portugal,"The role of climatic variability on vegetation greenness over mainland Portugal (2000-2014) was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation greenness. The gridded Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), gridded maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures, defined on a monthly basis, were used to assess climatic variability. Different vegetation classes were studied separately: grasslands, holm oak and cork oak, shrubland, deciduous forests and other evergreen forests. Type-specific models were developed to represent NDVI variability, using lagged monthly anomalies (up to 6 mo) of SPEI, TX and TN as exploratory variables. For southern Portugal, occupied mainly by grassland and low density woodland, vegetation greenness is very sensitive to precipitation. This sensitivity is particularly clear in February-March and September. Conversely, in the northwestern regions, where shrubland and evergreen/deciduous forests prevail, vegetation greenness is much less sensitive to precipitation seasonality. After cross-validation, the type specific vegetation models explained 50-88% of the observed NDVI variability (relative errors of 3-7%). Models showed that SPEI significantly correlates with vegetation greenness at 3 and 6 mo timescales. At the same timescales, anomalously low TX and, to a much lower extent, anomalously high TN tend to favour vegetation greenness. It is thus possible to predict vegetation greenness in Portugal, up to 3 mo in advance and for different vegetation types, with some accuracy. A thorough understanding of the relationships between vegetation greenness and precipitation variability may promote a better management of forest/agroforestry systems, water resources, ecosystems and landscapes, particularly under changing climates.",https://doi.org/10.3354/cr01521,"Costa, R; Fraga, H; Fernandes, PM; Santos, JA",2018,Article,Clim.

416,Predicting Heat Stress to Inform Reef Management: NOAA Coral Reef Watch's 4-Month Coral Bleaching Outlook,"The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) operates a global 4-Month Coral Bleaching Outlook system for shallow-water coral reefs in collaboration with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The Outlooks are generated by applying the algorithm used in CRW's operational satellite coral bleaching heat stress monitoring, with slight modifications, to the sea surface temperature (SST) predictions from NCEP's operational Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). Once a week, the probability of heat stress capable of causing mass coral bleaching is predicted for 4-months in advance. Each day, CFSv2 generates an ensemble of 16 forecasts, with nine runs out to 45-days, three runs out to 3-months, and four runs out to 9-months. This results in 28-112 ensemble members produced each week. A composite for each predicted week is derived from daily predictions within each ensemble member. The probability of each of four heat stress ranges (Watch and higher, Warning and higher, Alert Level 1 and higher, and Alert Level 2) is determined from all the available ensemble members for the week to form the weekly probabilistic Outlook. The probabilistic 4-Month Outlook is the highest weekly probability predicted among all the weekly Outlooks during a 4-month period for each of the stress ranges. An initial qualitative skill analysis of the Outlooks for 2011-2015, compared with CRW's satellite-based coral bleaching heat stress products, indicated the Outlook has performed well with high hit rates and low miss rates for most coral reef areas. Regions identified with high false alarm rates will guide future improvements. This Outlook system, as the first and only freely available global coral bleaching prediction system, has been providing critical early warning to marine resource managers, scientists, and decision makers around the world to guide management, protection, and monitoring of coral reefs since 2012. This has been especially valuable during the third global coral bleaching event that started in mid-2014 and extended into mid-2017. The Outlook system is an integrated component of CRW's global decision support system for coral bleaching. Recent management actions taken in light of this system are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00057,"Liu, G; Eakin, CM; Chen, MY; Kumar, A; De La Cour, JL; Heron, SF; Geiger, EF; Skirving, WJ; Tirak, KV; Strong, AE",2018,Article,Front.

47,Forecasting biodiversity in breeding birds using best practices,"Biodiversity forecasts are important for conservation, management, and evaluating how well current models characterize natural systems. While the number of forecasts for biodiversity is increasing, there is little information available on how well these forecasts work. Most biodiversity forecasts are not evaluated to determine how well they predict future diversity, fail to account for uncertainty, and do not use time-series data that captures the actual dynamics being studied. We addressed these limitations by using best practices to explore our ability to forecast the species richness of breeding birds in North America. We used hindcasting to evaluate six different modeling approaches for predicting richness. Hindcasts for each method were evaluated annually for a decade at 1,237 sites distributed throughout the continental United States. All models explained more than 50% of the variance in richness, but none of them consistently outperformed a baseline model that predicted constant richness at each site. The best practices implemented in this study directly influenced the forecasts and evaluations. Stacked species distribution models and ""naive"" forecasts produced poor estimates of uncertainty and accounting for this resulted in these models dropping in the relative performance compared to other models. Accounting for observer effects improved model performance overall, but also changed the rank ordering of models because it did not improve the accuracy of the ""naive"" model. Considering the forecast horizon revealed that the prediction accuracy decreased across all models as the time. horizon of the forecast increased. To facilitate the rapid improvement of biodiversity forecasts, we emphasize the value of specific best practices in making forecasts and evaluating forecasting methods.",https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4278,"Harris, DJ; Taylor, SD; White, EP",2018,Article,PeerJ,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,range of time horizons.

We developed a bird migration forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of variation was explained). Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Bird migration forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.",https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7526,"Van Doren, BM; Horton, KG",2018,Article,Science,English,abby lewis,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,so cool,NA

It is thus of large public interest to increase our knowledge of pollen grain behavior in the atmosphere (source, emission, processes involved during their transport, etc.) at fine temporal and spatial scales. First simulations with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center NMMB-MONARCHv1.0 model of Platanus and Pinus dispersion in the atmosphere were performed during a 5-day pollination event observed in Barcelona, Spain, between 27 - 31 March, 2015. The simulations are compared to vertical profiles measured with the continuous Barcelona Micro Pulse Lidar system. Improvements in the model are made by tuning the wind effect scale factor and the sedimentation speed.

317,Adaptive forecasting of phytoplankton communities,"The global proliferation of harmful algal blooms poses an increasing threat to water resources, recreation and ecosystems. Predicting the occurrence of these blooms is therefore needed to assist water managers in making management decisions to mitigate their impact. Evaluation of the potential for forecasting of algal blooms using the phytoplankton community model PROTECH was undertaken in pseudo-real-time. This was achieved within a data assimilation scheme using the Ensemble Kalman Filter to allow uncertainties and model nonlinearities to be propagated to forecast outputs. Tests were made on two mesotrophic lakes in the English Lake District, which differ in depth and nutrient regime. Some forecasting success was shown for chlorophyll a, but not all forecasts were able to perform better than a persistence forecast. There was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods. Associated forecasts of phytoplankton community structure were broadly consistent with observations but their translation to cyanobacteria forecasts was challenging owing to the interchangeability of simulated functional species.

361,Statistical modelling of crop yield in Central Europe using climate data and remote sensing vegetation indices,"In the present study, multiple linear regression models were constructed to simulate the yield of winter wheat, rapeseed, maize and sunflower in Hungary for the 2000-2016 time period. We used meteorological data and soil water content from meteorological reanalysis as predictors of the models in monthly resolution. We included annual fertilizer amount in the analysis to remove trend from the census data. We also used remote sensing based vegetation index to extend the approach for early crop yield forecast purposes and to study the added value of proxy data on the predictive power of the statistical models. Using a stepwise linear regression-like method the most appropriate models were selected based on the statistical evaluation of the model fitting. We provided simple equations with well interpretable coefficients that can estimate crop yield with high accuracy. Cross-validated explained variance were 67% for winter wheat, 76% for rapeseed, 81% for maize and 68.5% for sunflower. The modelling exercise showed that positive anomaly of minimum temperature in May has a substantial negative effect on the final crop yield for all four crops. For winter wheat increasing maximum temperature in May has a beneficial effect, while higher-than-usual vapour pressure deficit in May decreases yield. For maize soil water content in July and August is crucial in terms of the final yield. Incorporation of the vegetation index improved the predictive power of the models at country scale, with 10%, 2% and 4% for winter wheat, rapeseed and maize, respectively. At the county level, remote sensing data improved the overall predictive power of the models only for winter wheat. The results provide simple yet robust models for spatially explicit yield forecast as well as yield projection for the near future.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.06.009,"Kern, A; Barcza, Z; Marjanovic, H; Arendas, T; Fodor, N; Bonis, P; Bognar, P; Lichtenberger, J",2018,Article,Agric.

68,A new scheme to optimize irrigation depth using a numerical model of crop response to irrigation and quantitative weather forecasts,"Irrigation management can be improved by utilizing advances in numerical models of water flow in soils that can consider future rainfall by utilizing data from weather forecasts. Toward this end, we developed a numerical scheme to determine optimal irrigation depth on scheduled irrigation days based on a concept of virtual net income as a function of cumulative transpiration over each irrigation interval; this scheme combines a numerical model of crop response to irrigation and quantitative weather forecasts. To evaluate benefits, we compared crop growth and net income of this proposed scheme to those of an automated irrigation method using soil water sensors. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.), cv. Kintoki) was grown in 2016 in a sandy field of the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University, Japan under either a non-optimized automated irrigation or the proposed scheme. Under the proposed scheme, 18% less water was applied, yield increased by 19%, and net income was increased by 25% compared with the results of the automated irrigation system. In addition, soil water content simulated by the proposed scheme was in fair agreement with observed values. Thus, it was shown that the proposed scheme may enhance net income and be a viable alternative for determining irrigation depths.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.05.016,"Abd El Baki, HM; Fujimaki, H; Tokumoto, I; Saito, T",2018,Article,Comput.

435,Expertise for forecasting cotton production in Western Africa: a solution to emerging climate uncertainty?,"Description of the subject. Climate uncertainty is expected to have a severe impact on the economy of West African countries. The use of forecasting in agricultural production has become a priority for those working in the field of development. This article focuses on the early prediction of cotton production levels before harvesting in Senegal, using expertise from the cotton development company, SODEFITEX. Objectives. This paper aims to analyze the knowledge employed to predict yield, given the uncertainty about future climate conditions, and to evaluate the quality of such predictions, depending on the territorial scale of the expertise considered. Method. The methodology used in this study was a statistical analysis of cotton production in Senegal between 2004 and 2015, combined with a survey of 32 SODEFITEX experts. Results. Analysis of the survey of experts revealed that their evaluation of the cotton production was based mainly on the state of the crops and on crop management, with the planting date being the priority. For some experts, the history of production and its organizational and social environments were also important factors. A comparison of forecasts with actual production showed that the experts had systematically overestimated the levels of production when actual yields were below 1,000 kg-ha(-1), under adverse climatic conditions. Conclusions. Within a context of poor scientific documentation of the early estimation of production by experts, the results of the study shed light on the knowledge drawn upon and the performance of the forecasts delivered, thus paving the way for a rational criticism of the expertise employed. The diversity of points of view highlighted by the multi-criteria analysis, between hierarchical levels and between agents at the same level, underlines the need for a closer look at the knowledge being utilized, in order to bring out ""what matters"" in these forecasts and to move towards greater objectivity of expertise in the face of recurrent climate hazards.",NA,"Ndour, A; Clouvel, P; Goze, E; Martin, P; Leroux, L; Dieng, A; Loison, R",2018,Article,Biotechnol.

186,Forecasting Responses of a Northern Peatland Carbon Cycle to Elevated CO2 and a Gradient of Experimental Warming,"The ability to forecast ecological carbon cycling is imperative to land management in a world where past carbon fluxes are no longer a clear guide in the Anthropocene. However, carbon-flux forecasting has not been practiced routinely like numerical weather prediction. This study explored (1) the relative contributions of model forcing data and parameters to uncertainty in forecasting flux- versus pool-based carbon cycle variables and (2) the time points when temperature and CO2 treatments may cause statistically detectable differences in those variables. We developed an online forecasting workflow (Ecological Platform for Assimilation of Data (EcoPAD)), which facilitates iterative data-model integration. EcoPAD automates data transfer from sensor networks, data assimilation, and ecological forecasting. We used the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Experiments data collected from 2011 to 2014 to constrain the parameters in the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, forecast carbon cycle responses to elevated CO2 and a gradient of warming from 2015 to 2024, and specify uncertainties in the model output. Our results showed that data assimilation substantially reduces forecasting uncertainties. Interestingly, we found that the stochasticity of future external forcing contributed more to the uncertainty of forecasting future dynamics of C flux-related variables than model parameters. However, the parameter uncertainty primarily contributes to the uncertainty in forecasting C pool-related response variables. Given the uncertainties in forecasting carbon fluxes and pools, our analysis showed that statistically different responses of fast-turnover pools to various CO2 and warming treatments were observed sooner than slow-turnover pools. Our study has identified the sources of uncertainties in model prediction and thus leads to improve ecological carbon cycling forecasts in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JG004040,"Jiang, J; Huang, YY; Ma, S; Stacy, M; Shi, Z; Ricciuto, DM; Hanson, PJ; Luo, YQ",2018,Article,J.

218,Algorithm for forecasting the total amount of airborne birch pollen from meteorological conditions of previous years,"The birch tree (genus Betula L.) disperses airborne pollen annually from April to June, causing severe symptoms in pollinosis sufferers. Because of interannual variations in pollen levels, there is an urgent need to develop a forecasting model with greater precision in order to provide accurate information to patients and medical personnel regarding airborne pollen levels. We developed an algorithm for forecasting the total amount of airborne birch pollen. This equation suggested that the total amount of airborne pollen in a given season could be estimated using only the meteorological data from previous years. In order to discover potential predictive relationships, a data set including airborne pollen data from 1996 to 2015 and meteorological data from 1990 to 2014 was used to construct forecasting models. Statistical evaluation results were examined to select the optimal model, showing that forecasting models obtained the highest accuracy when using meteorological data from June and the best model performance was achieved using the average daily maximum air temperature and solar radiation of the previous five years. We also developed an extended model that included relative humidity, which demonstrated better predictive capability. These findings clarify that a model with greater predictive power can be constructed using the meteorological conditions from the previous five years. In order to assess this conclusion, the algorithm was tested by forecasting the total amount of airborne birch pollen in Japan with good results.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.11.021,"Tseng, YT; Kawashima, S; Kobayashi, S; Takeuchi, S; Nakamura, K",2018,Article,Agric.

142,Cattle depredation risk by gray wolves on grazing allotments in Washington,"Livestock depredation was a primary factor in wolf extirpation from most of the conterminous United States by the 1930s. Through reintroductions and natural dispersals, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have recolonized portions of their former range. Livestock grazing occurs on federal lands in the western United States, including 31% of wolf-occupied areas in Idaho, Montana, and Washington. We investigated characteristics of cattle (Bos taurus) grazing allotments (n = 70) in Idaho (2004-2008), Montana (1991-2008), and Washington (2008-2016) to predict cattle depredation risk on grazing allotments in current and probable wolf-occupied areas of Washington (n = 162). Depredation probability and the predicted number of cattle depredated increased for allotments with higher cattle and wolf abundance. Top models accurately predicted 38% (n = 8) of allotments with verified cattle depredations as >= 61% depredation probability. Assuming pack sizes of five or ten wolves, 10% (n = 16) and 15% (n = 24) of cattle grazing allotments in Washington were forecasted at >= 61% depredation probability, respectively. This preliminary study identified areas in which wildlife and rangeland management agencies can focus proactive depredation prevention measures. However, additional fine-scale data (e.g., GPS locations of depredation locations and wolf core areas, animal husbandry practices, actual number of cattle by age class) are needed to improve model performance and further evaluate cattle depredation risk by wolves on grazing allotments in Washington.

243,Assimilation of Ocean-Color Plankton Functional Types to Improve Marine Ecosystem Simulations,"We assimilated phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) derived from ocean color into a marine ecosystem model, to improve the simulation of biogeochemical indicators and emerging properties in a shelf sea. Error-characterized chlorophyll concentrations of four PFTs (diatoms, dinoflagellates, nanoplankton, and picoplankton), as well as total chlorophyll for comparison, were assimilated into a physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The reanalysis simulations spanned the years 1998-2003. The skill of the reference and reanalysis simulations in estimating ocean color and in situ biogeochemical data were compared by using robust statistics. The reanalysis outperformed both the reference and the assimilation of total chlorophyll in estimating the ocean-color PFTs (except nanoplankton), as well as the not-assimilated total chlorophyll, leading the model to simulate better the plankton community structure. Crucially, the reanalysis improved the estimates of not-assimilated in situ data of PFTs, as well as of phosphate and pCO(2), impacting the simulation of the air-sea carbon flux. However, the reanalysis increased further the model overestimation of nitrate, in spite of increases in plankton nitrate uptake. The method proposed here is easily adaptable for use with other ecosystem models that simulate PFTs, for, e.g., reanalysis of carbon fluxes in the global ocean and for operational forecasts of biogeochemical indicators in shelf-sea ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JC013490,"Ciavatta, S; Brewin, RJW; Skakala, J; Polimene, L; de Mora, L; Artioli, Y; Allen, JI",2018,Article,J.

472,"Iterative near-term ecological forecasting: Needs, opportunities, and challenges","Two foundational questions about sustainability are ""How are ecosystems and the services they provide going to change in the future?"" and ""How do human decisions affect these trajectories?"" Answering these questions requires an ability to forecast ecological processes. Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions.

We focus on weekly dengue fever (DF) incidence rates in Singapore and demonstrate the strong negative correlation between an appropriately time-lagged total weekly rainfall and DF incidence. A Bayesian neural network time-series model for predicting DF incidence which utilizes rainfall data is introduced. A comparison is made between this neural network model and a time-series model which does not use any covariate information.

340,Early Forecasting of Rice Blast Disease Using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks,"Among all diseases affecting rice production, rice blast disease has the greatest impact. Thus, monitoring and precise prediction of the occurrence of this disease are important; early prediction of the disease would be especially helpful for prevention. Here, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based model for rice blast disease prediction. Historical data on rice blast occurrence in representative areas of rice production in South Korea and historical climatic data are used to develop a region-specific model for three different regions: Cheolwon, Icheon and Milyang. A rice blast incidence is then predicted a year in advance using long-term memory networks (LSTMs). The predictive performance of the proposed LSTM model is evaluated by varying the input variables (i.e., rice blast disease scores, air temperature, relative humidity and sunshine hours). The most widely cultivated rice varieties are also selected and the prediction results for those varieties are analyzed. Application of the LSTM model to the accumulated rice-blast disease score data confirms successful prediction of rice blast incidence. In all regions, the predictions are most accurate when all four input variables are combined. Rice blast fungus prediction using the proposed LSTM model is variety-based; therefore, this model will be more helpful for rice breeders and rice blast researchers than conventional rice blast prediction models.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su10010034,"Kim, Y; Roh, JH; Kim, HY",2018,Article,Sustainability,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,1,NA,,,NA
64,Phenological sequences: how early-season events define those that follow,"Premise of the Study Methods Plant phenology is a critical trait, as the timings of phenophases such as budburst, leafout, flowering, and fruiting, are important to plant fitness. Despite much study about when individual phenophases occur and how they may shift with climate change, little is known about how multiple phenophases relate to one another across an entire growing season. We test the extent to which early phenological stages constrain later ones, throughout a growing season, across 25 angiosperm tree species. We observed phenology (budburst, leafout, flowering, fruiting, and senescence) of 118 individual trees across 25 species, from April through December 2015. Key Results Conclusions We found that early phenological events weakly constrain most later events, with the strongest constraints seen between consecutive stages. In contrast, interphase duration was a much stronger predictor of phenology, especially for reproductive events, suggesting that the development time of flowers and fruits may constrain the phenology of these events. Much of the variation in later phenological events can be explained by the timing of earlier events and by interphase durations. This highlights that a shift in one phenophase may often have cascading effects on later phases. Accurate forecasts of climate change impacts should therefore include multiple phenophases within and across years.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1174,"Ettinger, AK; Gee, S; Wolkovich, EM",2018,Article,Am.

18,Insights on multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical ocean variables using an Ensemble Kalman Filter and an idealized model of upwelling,"Effective data assimilation methods for incorporating observations into marine biogeochemical models are required to improve hindcasts, nowcasts and forecasts of the ocean's biogeochemical state. Recent assimilation efforts have shown that updating model physics alone can degrade biogeochemical fields while only updating biogeochemical variables may not improve a model's predictive skill when the physical fields are inaccurate. Here we systematically investigate whether multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical model states are superior to only updating either physical or biogeochemical variables. We conducted a series of twin experiments in an idealized ocean channel that experiences wind-driven upwelling. The forecast model was forced with biased wind stress and perturbed biogeochemical model parameters compared to the model run representing the ""truth"". Taking advantage of the multivariate nature of the deterministic Ensemble Kalman Filter (DEnKF), we assimilated different combinations of synthetic physical (sea surface height, sea surface temperature and temperature profiles) and biogeochemical (surface chlorophyll and nitrate profiles) observations. We show that when biogeochemical and physical properties are highly correlated (e.g., thermocline and nutricline), multivariate updates of both are essential for improving model skill and can be accomplished by assimilating either physical (e.g., temperature profiles) or biogeochemical (e.g., nutrient profiles) observations. In our idealized domain, the improvement is largely due to a better representation of nutrient upwelling, which results in a more accurate nutrient input into the euphotic zone. In contrast, assimilating surface chlorophyll improves the model state only slightly, because surface chlorophyll contains little information about the vertical density structure. We also show that a degradation of the correlation between observed subsurface temperature and nutrient fields, which has been an issue in several previous assimilation studies, can be reduced by multivariate updates of physical and biogeochemical fields.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2018.04.005,"Yu, LQ; Fennel, K; Bertino, L; El Gharamti, M; Thompson, KR",2018,Article,Ocean Model.,English,abby lewis,don't seem to be forecasting,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
171,"The M4 Competition: Results, findings, conclusion and way forward","The M4 competition is the continuation of three previous competitions started more than 45 years ago whose purpose was to learn how to improve forecasting accuracy, and how such learning can be applied to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The purpose of M4 was to replicate the results of the previous ones and extend them into three directions: First significantly increase the number of series, second include Machine Learning (ML) forecasting methods, and third evaluate both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were ""combinations"" of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a ""hybrid"" approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method's average sMAPE was close to 10% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naive2. This paper presents some initial results of M4, its major findings and a logical conclusion. Finally, it outlines what the authors consider to be the way forward for the field of forecasting.

92,Evaluating statistical models to measure environmental change: A tidal turbine case study,"Statistical models are routinely used in Before-After monitoring studies to detect, quantify, and forecast environmental change caused by natural or anthropogenic disturbances. For monitoring programs that have not established standard statistical procedures, an evaluation of models' abilities to measure change over a range of scenarios is vital to develop best practices for analyzing monitoring data. A comprehensive evaluation was developed and applied using Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) tidal turbine site as a case study of a developing industry with no standard monitoring methods. Before-After monitoring datasets that contained change were simulated using normal and non-normal empirical baseline data collected at a MRE site. Thirteen regression models from three classes were evaluated: 6 generalized regression models, 4 time series models, and 3 non parametric models. Intervention Analysis was used to fit models to five change scenarios that included three amplitudes of change and a lag in the onset of change. A power analysis was used to evaluate model ability to detect change. Residual error diagnostics were used to quantify model fit and forecast accuracy. Parametric models that did not include lagged dependent variables were the most capable at detecting change. A comparison of the fit and forecast metric results indicated that deterministic time series models in conjunction with semi-parametric generalized regression models provided a robust and informative quantification of change. Nonparametric models most accurately forecasted change. The results provide insight on model behavior, which is used to recommend specific models to measure change in the case study data. These recommendations form best practices for analyzing monitoring data, which enables comparisons among monitoring sites and reduces uncertainty when quantifying environmental effects.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.041,"Linder, HL; Horne, JK",2018,Article,Ecol.

170,Skillful Climate Forecasts of the Tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean Using Model-Analogs,"Seasonal forecasts made by coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CGCMs) undergo strong climate drift and initialization shock, driving the model state away from its long-term attractor. Here we explore initializing directly on a model's own attractor, using an analog approach in which model states close to the observed initial state are drawn from a ""library'' obtained from prior uninitialized CGCM simulations. The subsequent evolution of those ""model-analogs'' yields a forecast ensemble, without additional model integration. This technique is applied to four of the eight CGCMs comprising the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) by selecting from prior long control runs those model states whose monthly tropical Indo-Pacific SST and SSH anomalies best resemble the observations at initialization time. Hindcasts are then made for leads of 1-12 months during 1982-2015. Deterministic and probabilistic skill measures of these model-analog hindcast ensembles are comparable to those of the initialized NMME hindcast ensembles, for both the individual models and the multimodel ensemble. In the eastern equatorial Pacific, model-analog hindcast skill exceeds that of the NMME. Despite initializing with a relatively large ensemble spread, model-analogs also reproduce each CGCM's perfect-model skill, consistent with a coarse-grained view of tropical Indo-Pacific predictability. This study suggests that with little additional effort, sufficiently realistic and long CGCM simulations provide the basis for skillful seasonal forecasts of tropical Indo-Pacific SST anomalies, even without sophisticated data assimilation or additional ensemble forecast integrations. The model-analog method could provide a baseline for forecast skill when developing future models and forecast systems.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0661.1,"Ding, H; Newman, M; Alexander, MA; Wittenberg, AT",2018,Article,J.

256,A dynamic agricultural prediction system for large-scale drought assessment on the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer,"Crop models are widely used to evaluate the response of crop growth to drought. However, over large geographic regions, the most advanced models are often restricted by available computing resource. This limits capacity to undertake uncertainty analysis and prohibits the use of models in real-time ensemble forecasting systems. This study addresses these concerns by presenting an integrated system for the dynamic prediction and assessment of agricultural yield using the top-ranked Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer platform. This system enables parallelization and acceleration for the existing AquaCrop, DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition) and SWAP (Soil Water Atmosphere Plant) models, thus facilitating multi-model ensemble and parameter optimization and subsequent drought risk analysis in multiple regions and at multiple scales. The high computing capability also opens up the possibility of real-time simulation during droughts, providing the basis for more effective drought management. Initial testing with varying core group numbers shows that computation time can be reduced by between 2.6 and 3.6 times. Based on the powerful computing capacity, a county-level model parameter optimization (2043 counties for 1996-2007) by Bayesian inference and multi-model ensemble using BMA (Bayesian Model Average) method were performed, demonstrating the enhancements in predictive accuracy that can be achieved. An application of this system is presented predicting the impacts of the drought of May July 2017 on maize yield in North and Northeast China. The spatial variability in yield losses is presented demonstrating new capability to provide high resolution information with associated uncertainty estimates.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.07.027,"Huang, X; Yu, CQ; Fang, JR; Huang, GR; Ni, SQ; Hall, J; Zorn, C; Huang, XM; Zhang, WY",2018,Article,Comput.

393,MultiModel Projections for Evaluating Sustainable Timber and Seed Harvest of Carapa guianensis,"Ecological models are increasingly used to forecast the long-term fate of populations after management interventions. The uncertainty associated with forecasts is important to investigate. Because model choice is one component of uncertainty, we compared projections of Carapa guianensis population growth rate (lambda) from matrix population models (MPMs) and integral projection models (IPMs). We also compared lambda projections for C. guianensis seed and timber harvest scenarios to those from previous MPMs for this economically valuable multiple-use tree species. Changes in the time interval of the MPM resulted in larger changes in lambda than changes in environmental conditions between years. The only exception to this trend was when representing impacts of a 2005 fire. Fire had a more severe impact on lambda when modeled with IPMs. The lambda(IPM) estimated in 2005-9 was 0.8122, almost 0.1 lower than the lambda(MPM) of 0.9115. The management implications of this research were mixed. Both MPM and IPM results indicated declining populations of C. guianensis even before simulated harvests. However, the annualized income from seed oil and timber harvests, although not ecologically sustainable, was comparable or higher than per-hectare earnings from rubber and other nontimber forest products in the Amazon.",https://doi.org/10.5849/FS-2017-001,"Klimas, CM; Cropper, WP; Kainer, KA; Wadt, LHD",2018,Article,For.

139,Opportunities and Limits of Using Meteorological Reanalysis Data for Simulating Seasonal to Sub-Daily Water Temperature Dynamics in a Large Shallow Lake,"In lakes and reservoirs, physical processes control temperature dynamics and stratification, which are important determinants of water quality. In large lakes, even extensive monitoring programs leave some of the patterns undiscovered and unresolved. Lake models can complement measurements in higher spatial and temporal resolution. These models require a set of driving data, particularly meteorological input data, which are compulsory to the models but at many locations not available at the desired scale or quality. It remains an open question whether these meteorological input data can be acquired in a sufficient quality by employing atmospheric models. In this study, we used the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data as meteorological forcing for the three-dimensional hydrodynamic General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). With this combination, we modelled the spatio-temporal variation in water temperature in the large, shallow Lake Chaohu, China. The model succeeded in reproducing the seasonal patterns of cooling and warming. While the model did predict diurnal patterns, these patterns were not precise enough to correctly estimate the extent of short stratification events. Nevertheless, applying reanalysis data proved useful for simulating general patterns of stratification dynamics and seasonal thermodynamics in a large shallow lake over the year. Utilising reanalysis data together with hydrodynamic models can, therefore, inform about water temperature dynamics in the respective water bodies and, by that, complement local measurements.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10050594,"Frassl, MA; Boehrer, B; Holtermann, PL; Hu, WP; Klingbeil, K; Peng, ZL; Zhu, JG; Rinke, K",2018,Article,Water,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,1,NA,,,NA
333,Evaluation of energy fluxes in the NCEP climate forecast system version 2.0 (CFSv2),"The energy fluxes at the surface and top of the atmosphere (TOA) from a long free run by the NCEP climate forecast system version 2.0 (CFSv2) are validated against several observation and reanalysis datasets. This study focuses on the annual mean energy fluxes and tries to link it with the systematic cold biases in the 2 m air temperature, particularly over the land regions. The imbalance in the long term mean global averaged energy fluxes are also evaluated. The global averaged imbalance at the surface and at the TOA is found to be 0.37 and 6.43 Wm(-2), respectively. It is shown that CFSv2 overestimates the land surface albedo, particularly over the snow region, which in turn contributes to the cold biases in 2 m air temperature. On the other hand, surface albedo is highly underestimated over the coastal region around Antarctica and that may have contributed to the warm bias over that oceanic region. This study highlights the need for improvements in the parameterization of snow/sea-ice albedo scheme for a realistic simulation of surface temperature and that may have implications on the global energy imbalance in the model.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3587-z,"Rai, A; Saha, SK",2018,Article,Clim.

357,"Climate change and allergy in Australia: an innovative, high-income country, at potential risk","Objectives: The impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases are important and potentially serious in Australia. Australia is highly vulnerable to such impacts because of its very high prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitisation to environmental allergens such as certain pollens and fungal spores. This article aims to review published research on the impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases from an Australian perspective. Methods: Research on climate change, allergens and allergy was reviewed. Recent global assessments of the topic were consulted, and supplemented with database searches to identify research published since the assessments were done, as well as research with an Australian focus. The databases used were Web of Science and Scopus. Only research published since the year 2000 was included. Results: The impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases are many and varied. Impacts on pollen include effects on pollen production and atmospheric pollen concentration, pollen seasonality, pollen allergenicity, and the dispersion and spatial distribution of pollen. Similarly, there is evidence for effects on fungal spore production, seasonality and allergenicity. There are also likely effects on indoor moisture and mould growth. Beyond these respiratory allergens, climate change may also affect food allergens, stinging insect allergens and contact allergens. All these changes could affect allergic diseases, in particular allergic respiratory diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Conclusions: A large and sophisticated body of research exists from which to gauge both current and potential future impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases. However, most, if not all, of this is from outside Australia. Australian-focused research is therefore urgently needed. Australia's vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change on allergic diseases is compounded by the precarious nature of aeroallergen monitoring, reporting and forecasting in this country. But Australia has an impressive wealth of relevant experience and expertise, and has the potential to address the challenge of both current and future impacts of climate change on allergens and allergic diseases.",https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp2841828,"Beggs, PJ",2018,Article,Public Health Res.

108,Measurement of shock effect following change of one-child policy based on grey forecasting approach,"Purpose This paper aims to analyze general development trend of China's population and to forecast China's total population under the change of China's family planning policy so as to measure shock disturbance effects on China's population development. Design/methodology/approach China has been the most populous country for hundreds of years. And this state will be sustained in the forthcoming decade. Obviously, China is confronted with greater pressure on controlling total scale of population than any other country. Meanwhile, controlling population will be beneficial for not only China but also the whole world. This paper first analyzes general development trend of China's population total amount, sex ratio and aging ratio. The mechanism for measurement of the impact effect of a policy shock disturbance is proposed. Linear regression model, exponential curve model and grey Verhulst model are adopted to test accuracy of simulation of China's total population. Then considering the policy shock disturbance on population, discrete grey model, DGM (1, 1), and grey Verhulst model were adopted to measure how China's one-child policy affected its total population between 1978 and 2015. And similarly, the grey Verhulst model and scenario analysis of economic developing level were further used to forecast the effect of adjustment from China's one-child policy to two-child policy. Findings Results show that China has made an outstanding contribution toward controlling population; it was estimated that China prevented nearly 470 million births since the late 1970s to 2015. However, according to the forecast, with the adjustment of the one-child policy, the birth rate will be a little higher, China's total population was estimated to reach 1,485.59 million in 2025. Although the scale of population will keep increasing, but it is tolerable for China and sex ratio and trend of aging will be relieved obviously. Practical implications The approach constructed in the paper can be used to measure the effect of population change under the policy shock disturbance. It can be used for other policy effect measurement problems under shock events' disturbance. Originality/value The paper succeeded in studying the mechanism for the measurement of the post-impact effect of a policy and the effect of changes in China's population following the revision of the one-child policy. The mechanism is useful for solving system forecasting problems and can contribute toward improving the grey decision-making models.",https://doi.org/10.1108/K-05-2017-0159,"Xie, NM; Wang, RZ; Chen, NL",2018,Article,Kybernetes,English,mary lofton,NA,0,0,1,NA,,,NA
217,Ecosystem-based forecasts of recruitment in two menhaden species,"Gulf (Brevoortia patronus, Clupeidae) and Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus, Clupeidae) support large fisheries that have shown substantial variability over several decades, in part, due to dependence on annual recruitment. Nevertheless, traditional stock-recruitment relationships lack predictive power for these stocks. Current management of Atlantic menhaden explicitly treats recruitment as a random process. However, traditional methods for understanding recruitment variability carry the very specific hypothesis that the effect of adult biomass on subsequent recruitment occurs independently of other ecosystem factors such as food availability and predation. Here, we evaluate the predictability of menhaden recruitment using a model-free approach that is not restricted by these strong assumptions. We find that menhaden recruitment is predictable, but only when allowing for interdependence of stock with other ecological factors. Moreover, while the analysis confirms the presence of environmental effects, the environment alone does not readily account for the complexity of menhaden recruitment dynamics. The findings set the stage for revisiting recruitment prediction in management and serve as an instructive example in the ongoing debate about how to best treat and understand recruitment variability across species and fisheries.",https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12287,"Deyle, E; Schueller, AM; Ye, H; Pao, GM; Sugihara, G",2018,Article,Fish.

433,Atmospheric teleconnection influence on North American land surface phenology,"Short-term forecasts of vegetation activity are currently not well constrained due largely to our lack of understanding of coupled climate-vegetation dynamics mediated by complex interactions between atmospheric teleconnection patterns. Using ecoregion-scale estimates of North American vegetation activity inferred from remote sensing (1982-2015), we examined seasonal and spatial relationships between land surface phenology and the atmospheric components of five teleconnection patterns over the tropical Pacific, north Pacific, and north Atlantic. Using a set of regression experiments, we also tested for interactions among these teleconnection patterns and assessed predictability of vegetation activity solely based on knowledge of atmospheric teleconnection indices. Autumn-to-winter composites of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were strongly correlated with start of growing season timing, especially in the Pacific Northwest. The two leading modes of north Pacific variability (the Pacific-North American, PNA, and West Pacific patterns) were significantly correlated with start of growing season timing across much of southern Canada and the upper Great Lakes. Regression models based on these Pacific teleconnections were skillful predictors of spring phenology across an east-west swath of temperate and boreal North America, between 40 degrees N-60 degrees N. While the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was not strongly correlated with start of growing season timing on its own, we found compelling evidence of widespread NAO-SOI and NAO-PNA interaction effects. These results suggest that knowledge of atmospheric conditions over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans increases the predictability of North American spring phenology. A more robust consideration of the complexity of the atmospheric circulation system, including interactions across multiple ocean basins, is an important step towards accurate forecasts of vegetation activity.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa85a,"Dannenberg, MP; Wise, EK; Janko, M; Hwang, T; Smith, WK",2018,Article,Environ.

458,Spring Onset Predictability in the North American Multimodel Ensemble,"The predictability of spring onset is assessed using an index of its interannual variability (the ""extended spring index"" or SI-x) and output from the North American Multimodel Ensemble reforecast experiment. The input data to compute SI-x were treated with a daily joint bias correction approach, and the SI-x outputs computed from the North American Multimodel Ensemble were postprocessed using an ensemble model output statistic approachnonhomogeneous Gaussian regression. This ensemble model output statistic approach was used to quantify the effects of training period length and ensemble size on forecast skill. The lead time for predicting the timing of spring onset is found to be from 10 to 60 days, with the higher end of this range located along a narrow band between 35 degrees N to 45 degrees N in the eastern United States. Using continuous rank probability scores and skill score (SS) thresholds, this study demonstrates that ranges of positive predictability of SI-x fall into two categories: 10-40 and 40-60 days. Using higher skill thresholds (SS equal to 0.1 and 0.2), predictability is confined to a lower range with values around 10-30 days. The postprocessing work using joint bias correction improves the predictive skill for SI-x relative to the untreated input data set. Using nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression, a positive change in the SS is noted in regions where the skill with joint bias correction shows evidence of improvement. These findings suggest that the start of spring might be predictable on intraseasonal time horizons, which in turn could be useful for farmers, growers, and stakeholders making decisions on these time scales.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JD028597,"Carrillo, CM; Ault, TR; Wilks, DS",2018,Article,J.

60,Combined use of agro-climatic and very high-resolution remote sensing information for crop monitoring,"Accurate and real-time yield forecasting is one of the main pillars for decision making in farming and thus for farmers' profitability. Biomass has been traditionally predicted by multi- and hyperspectral vegetation indices from low- and medium-resolution platforms. This research work aimed to assess the accuracy of the combined use of agro-climatic information and very high-resolution products obtained with RGB cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for biomass predictions in maize (Zea mays L.). Two agro-climatic predictors, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and growing degree days (GDDs), and twelve vegetation indices (VIs) derived from RGB bands were calculated for the entire growing cycle. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model that considers only GDD to estimate total dry biomass (TDB) was 692.7 g m(-2), which was reduced to 509.3 g m(-2) when introducing as predictor variables the VARI and GLI vegetation indices. Difficulties in the radiometric calibration of consumer grade RGB cameras together with sources of error such as the bidirectional reflectance distribution function and the blending algorithms in the photogrammetry processing could decrease the applicability of the obtained relationship and should be further evaluated. This study illustrated the advantage of the combined use of agro-climatic predictors (GDD) and green-based VIs derived from RGB consumer grade cameras for biomass predictions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.019,"Ballesteros, R; Ortega, JF; Hernandez, D; del Campo, A; Moreno, MA",2018,Article,Int.

Here we present the first global forecasts of changes incoastal lobster species distribution under climate change, using an ensemble of ecological niche models (ENMs). Global changes in richness were projected for 125 coastal lobster species for the end of the century, using a stabilization scenario (4.5 RCP). We compared projected changes in diversity with lobster fisheries data and found that losses in suitable habitat for coastal lobster species were mainly projected in areas with high commercial fishing interest, with species projected to contract their climatic envelope between 40 and 100%. Higher losses of spiny lobsters are projected in the coasts of wider Caribbean/Brazil, eastern Africa and Indo-Pacific region, areas with several directed fisheries and aquacultures, while clawed lobsters are projected to shifts their envelope to northern latitudes likely affecting the North European, North American and Canadian fisheries. Fisheries represent an important resource for local and global economies and understanding how they might be affected by climate change scenarios is paramount when developing specific or regional management strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3441-9,"Boavida-Portugal, J; Rosa, R; Calado, R; Pinto, M; Boavida-Portugal, I; Araujo, MB; Guilhaumon, F",2018,Article,Mar.

228,Targeting Extreme Events: Complementing Near-Term Ecological Forecasting With Rapid Experiments and Regional Surveys,"Ecologists are improving predictive capability using near-term ecological forecasts, in which predictions are made iteratively and publically to increase transparency, rate of learning, and maximize utility. Ongoing ecological forecasting efforts focus mostly on long-term datasets of continuous variables, such as CO2 fluxes, or more abrupt variables, such as phenological events or algal blooms. Generally lacking from these forecasting efforts is the integration of short-term, opportunistic data concurrent with developing climate extremes such as drought. We posit that incorporating targeted experiments and regional surveys, implemented rapidly during developing extreme events, into current forecasting efforts will ultimately enhance our ability to forecast ecological responses to climate extremes, which are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity. We highlight a project, ""chasing tree die-off,"" in which we coupled an experiment with regional-scale observational field surveys during a developing severe drought to test and improve forecasts of tree die-off. General insights to consider in incorporating this approach include: (1) tracking developing climate extremes in near-real time to efficiently ramp up measurements rapidly and, if feasible, initiate an experiment quickly-including funding and site selection challenges; (2) accepting uncertainty in projected extreme climatic events and adjusting sampling design over-time as needed, especially given the spatially heterogeneous nature of many ecological disturbances; and (3) producing timely and iterative output. In summary, targeted experiments and regional surveys implemented rapidly during developing extreme climatic events offer promise to efficiently (both financially and logistically) improve our ability to forecast ecological responses to climate extremes.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00183,"Redmond, MD; Law, DJ; Field, JP; Meneses, N; Carroll, CJW; Wion, AP; Breshears, DD; Cobb, NS; Dietze, MC; Gallery, RE",2019,Article,Front.

362,Improving Mountain Pine Beetle Survival Predictions Using Multi-Year Temperatures Across the Western USA,"Global climate change has led to an increase in large-scale bark beetle outbreaks in forests around the world, resulting in significant impacts to forest ecosystems, timber economies, and forest-dependent communities. As such, prediction models that utilize temperature for estimating future bark beetle locations and consequential tree mortality are critical for informing forest management decision-making in an attempt to mitigate and adapt to pending and current outbreaks. This is especially true for physiological models that account for the effects of overwinter temperatures on bark beetle survival, as seasonal temperatures, specifically during winter months, exert the greatest impact on bark beetle mortality during various stages of life cycle development. Yet, how temperature observations are used to predict bark beetle survival can significantly under- or over-estimate the role that temperature variability plays in annual tree mortality, especially under current climate change trajectories. This study evaluates how representations of winter temperature influence bark beetle survival estimates. Using the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) across the western USA as a case study, single-year to decade-long winter temperature averages were used as inputs into a physiological beetle survival prediction model, the results of which were compared against beetle-induced tree mortality observations using temporal autoregressive models. Results show that using longer-term survival averages of seven to ten years significantly increases the likelihood that temperature alone can predict general levels of beetle survival and hence beetle-induced mortality. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the role of long-term temperature observations when forecasting bark beetle outbreaks, and that year-to-year temperature variability may be constrained in predicting beetle survival during outbreak periods.",https://doi.org/10.3390/f10100866,"Bone, C; Nelson, MF",2019,Article,Forests,English,rachel corrigan,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,I believe they use winter temperatures to predict summer tree die off,NA
359,A Bayesian structural model for predicting algal blooms,"A Bayesian structural model with two components is proposed to forecast the occurrence of algal blooms, multivariate mean-reverting diffusion process (MMRD), and a binary probit model with latent Markov regime-switching process (BPMRS). The model has three features: (a) forecast of the occurrence probability of algal bloom is directly based on oceanographic parameters, not the forecasting of special indicators in traditional approaches, such as phytoplankton or chlorophyll-a; (b) augmentation of daily oceanographic parameters from the data collected every 2 weeks is based on MMRD. The proposed method solves the problem of unavailability of daily oceanographic parameters in practice; (c) BPMRS captures the unobservable factors which affect algal bloom occurrence and therefore improve forecast accuracy. We use panel data collected in Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong, to validate the model. The model demonstrates good forecasting for out-of-sample rolling forecasts, especially for algal bloom appearing for a longer period, which severely damages fisheries and the marine environment.",https://doi.org/10.1002/for.2583,"Sun, XY; Liu, T; Wang, JY",2019,Article,J.

451,"Performance of the MARS-crop yield forecasting system for the European Union: Assessing accuracy, in-season, and year-to-year improvements from 1993 to 2015","19,980 crop yield forecasts have been published for the European Union (EU) Member States (MS) during 1993-2015 using the MARS-Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS). We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006-2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006-2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73%. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value < 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.06.009,"van der Velde, M; Nisini, L",2019,Article,Agric.

358,Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix as early warning signals for critical transitions in ecological systems,"Many ecological systems are subject critical transitions, which are abrupt changes to contrasting states triggered by small changes in some key component of the system. Temporal early warning signals such as the variance of a time series, and spatial early warning signals such as the spatial correlation in a snapshot of the system's state, have been proposed to forecast critical transitions. However, temporal early warning signals do not take the spatial pattern into account, and past spatial indicators only examine one snapshot at a time. In this study, we propose the use of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of multiple time series as early warning signals. We first show theoretically why these indicators may increase as the system moves closer to the critical transition. Then, we apply the method to simulated data from several spatial ecological models to demonstrate the method's applicability. This method has the advantage that it takes into account only the fluctuations of the system about its equilibrium, thus eliminating the effects of any change in equilibrium values. The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix is helpful for identifying the regions that are most vulnerable to the critical transition.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38961-5,"Chen, SY; O'Dea, EB; Drake, JM; Epureanu, BI",2019,Article,Sci Rep,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,useful to help make forecasting systems,NA
54,"Realized ecological forecast through an interactive Ecological Platform for Assimilating Data (EcoPAD, v1.0) into models","Predicting future changes in ecosystem services is not only highly desirable but is also becoming feasible as several forces (e.g., available big data, developed data assimilation (DA) techniques, and advanced cyber-infrastructure) are converging to transform ecological research into quantitative forecasting. To realize ecological forecasting, we have developed an Ecological Platform for Assimilating Data (EcoPAD, v1.0) into models. EcoPAD (v1.0) is a web-based software system that automates data transfer and processing from sensor networks to ecological forecasting through data management, model simulation, data assimilation, forecasting, and visualization. It facilitates interactive data-model integration from which the model is recursively improved through updated data while data are systematically refined under the guidance of model. EcoPAD (v1.0) relies on data from observations, process-oriented models, DA techniques, and the web-based workflow. We applied EcoPAD (v1.0) to the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental change (SPRUCE) experiment in northern Minnesota. The EcoPAD- SPRUCE realizes fully automated data transfer, feeds meteorological data to drive model simulations, assimilates both manually measured and automated sensor data into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model, and recursively forecasts the responses of various biophysical and biogeochemical processes to five temperature and two CO2 treatments in near-real time (weekly). Forecasting with EcoPAD-SPRUCE has revealed that mismatches in forecasting carbon pool dynamics are more related to model (e.g., model structure, parameter, and initial value) than forcing variables, opposite to forecasting flux variables. EcoPAD-SPRUCE quantified acclimations of methane production in response to warming treatments through shifted posterior distributions of the CH4 : CO2 ratio and the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of methane production towards lower values. Different case studies indicated that realistic forecasting of carbon dynamics relies on appropriate model structure, correct parameterization, and accurate external forcing. Moreover, EcoPADSPRUCE stimulated active feedbacks between experimenters and modelers to identify model components to be improved and additional measurements to be taken. It has become an interactive model-experiment (ModEx) system and opens a novel avenue for interactive dialogue between modelers and experimenters. Altogether, EcoPAD (v1.0) acts to integrate multiple sources of information and knowledge to best inform ecological forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-1119-2019,"Huang, YY; Stacy, M; Jiang, J; Sundi, N; Ma, S; Saruta, V; Jung, CG; Shi, Z; Xia, JY; Hanson, PJ; Ricciuto, D; Luo, YQ",2019,Article,Geosci.

375,On the skill of seasonal sea surface temperature forecasts in the California Current System and its connection to ENSO variability,"The California Current System (CCS) is a biologically productive Eastern Boundary Upwelling System that experiences considerable environmental variability on seasonal and interannual timescales. Given that this variability drives changes in ecologically and economically important living marine resources, predictive skill for regional oceanographic conditions is highly desirable. Here, we assess the skill of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts in the CCS using output from Global Climate Forecast Systems in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), and describe mechanisms that underlie SST predictability. A simple persistence forecast provides considerable skill for lead times up to similar to 4 months, while skill above persistence is mostly confined to forecasts of late winter/spring and derives primarily from predictable evolution of ENSO-related variability. Specifically, anomalously weak (strong) equatorward winds are skillfully forecast during El Nino (La Nina) events, and drive negative (positive) upwelling anomalies and consequently warm (cold) temperature anomalies. This mechanism prevails during moderate to strong ENSO events, while years of ENSO-neutral conditions are not associated with significant forecast skill in the wind or significant skill above persistence in SST. We find also a strong latitudinal gradient in predictability within the CCS; SST forecast skill is highest off the Washington/Oregon coast and lowest off southern California, consistent with variable wind forcing being the dominant driver of SST predictability. These findings have direct implications for regional downscaling of seasonal forecasts and for short-term management of living marine resources.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3608-y,"Jacox, MG; Alexander, MA; Stock, CA; Hervieux, G",2019,Article,Clim.

308,Forecast of Daily Reference Evapotranspiration Using a Modified Daily Thornthwaite Equation and Temperature Forecasts(dagger),"Short-term daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) forecasts are helpful for real-time irrigation decision making. Using a modified daily Thornthwaite (TH) equation and temperature forecasts, a method was proposed for ET0 forecasting. Daily meteorological data were obtained from the selected representative stations located in different climate regions in China. Data were collected from 2000 to 2012 to calibrate and validate the modified TH equation against the FAO56 Penman-Monteith (FAO56-PM) equation. Temperatures forecasts for a 7-day forecast period in 2012-2017 were input to the calibrated TH equation to forecast ET0. The results showed that the ET0 forecasting performance with the modified TH equation and temperature forecast was further improved at all stations after month-wise calibration. The average accuracy of forecasted ET0 ranged from 87.3 to 91.2%, the average values of root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.86 to 1.01 mm day ? (1); moreover, the average of regression coefficient (b), determined coefficient (R-2) and modelling efficiency (EF) are greater than 0.82, 0.87 and 0.81. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses show that the percentage change in ET0 forecast was more sensitive to predictions of temperature during the spring-summer period than autumn-winter. The proposed method produced good results of ET0 forecasts and can be a feasible solution for short-term forecasting of ET0.

126,Short-term forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration using the reduced-set Penman-Monteith model and public weather forecasts,"Farm irrigation management and real-time irrigation decisions are based on a series of parameters including irrigation water demand predictions which estimated by the short-term daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Based on the temperature data, a simplest empirical model called the temperature-based method, was developed to forecast near-future ETo. Although temperature is one of the most influential weather variables in ETo forecasting, wind velocity also has non-ignorable impact on the forecast performance of ETo. Therefore, we employed the Reduced-set Penman-Monteith (RPM) model for short-term ETo forecasting using temperature data derived from public weather forecasts and wind speed data. Four different types of wind speed data were adopted as model inputs, including wind speed assumed as a default value, i.e., u(2) = 2.0 m s(-1) (W1), forecasted wind speed (W2), long-term daily average wind speed (W3) and annual average wind speed (W4). Based on the above-mentioned wind speed inputs, we presented four types of RPM models (RC, RF, RD and RM models respectively corresponding to W1, W2, W3 and W4) to forecast daily ETo for lead times up to 7 days for eight weather stations in China. The results confirmed that the highest precision wind speed input was W3, followed by W4, W1 and W2, and the most accurate ETo forecasts of four RPM models was provided by RC, followed with RD, RM and RF. By comparing with one of the most common used temperature-based models, the Hargreaves-Samani (HS), it was found that the performance of RPM approaches were better than that of HS model for arid and sub-arid regions whereas opposite results were found in sub-tropical area, suggesting inclusion of wind speed parameter makes positive impact on ETo forecast for arid and semi-arid regions. Further, it was found that the greatest type of RPM model, the RC model, was superior to HS method for most climate regions, including arid, humid, sub-arid and sub-humid areas, thus, the W1 wind speed type could be highly recommended for ETo forecasting for most climate regions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.09.036,"Yang, Y; Cui, YL; Bai, KH; Luo, TY; Dai, JF; Wang, WG; Luo, YF",2019,Article,Agric.

431,"A high-resolution, integrated system for rice yield forecasting at district level","To meet the growing demands from public and private stakeholders for early yield estimates, a high-resolution (2 km x 2 km) rice yield forecasting system based on the integration of the WARM model and remote sensing (RS) technologies was developed. RS was used to identify rice-cropped area and to derive spatially distributed sowing dates, and for the dynamic assimilation of RS-derived leaf area index (LAI) data within the crop model. The system-tested for the main European rice production districts in Italy, Greece, and Spain-performed satisfactorily; > 66% of the inter-annual yield variability was explained in six out of eight combinations of ecotype x district, with a maximum of 89% of the variability explained for the 'Tropical Japonica' cultivars in the Vercelli district (Italy). In seven out of eight cases, the assimilation of RS-derived LAI improved the forecasting capability, with minor differences due to the assimilation technology used (updating or recalibration). In particular, RS data reduced uncertainty by capturing factors that were not properly reproduced by the simulation model (given the uncertainty due to large-area simulations). The system, which is an extension of the one used for rice within the EC-JRC-MARS forecasting system, was used pre-operationally in 2015 and 2016 to provide early yield estimates to private companies and institutional stakeholders within the EU-FP7 ERMES project.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.05.007,"Pagani, V; Guarneri, T; Busetto, L; Ranghetti, L; Boschetti, M; Movedi, E; Campos-Taberner, M; Garcia-Haro, FJ; Katsantonis, D; Stavrakoudis, D; Ricciardelli, E; Romano, F; Holecz, F; Collivignarelli, F; Granell, C; Casteleyn, S; Confalonieri, R",2019,Article,Agric.

164,Ensemble models with uncertainty analysis for multi-day ahead forecasting of chlorophyll a concentration in coastal waters,"In this study, ensemble models using the Bates-Granger approach and least square method are developed to combine forecasts of multi-wavelet artificial neural network (ANN) models. Originally, this study is aimed to investigate the proposed models for forecasting of chlorophyll a concentration. However, the modeling procedure was repeated for water salinity forecasting to evaluate the generality of the approach. The ensemble models are employed for forecasting purposes in Hilo Bay, Hawaii. Moreover, the efficacy of the forecasting models for up to three days in advance is investigated. To predict chlorophyll a and salinity with different lead, the previous daily time series up to three lags are decomposed via different wavelet functions to be applied as input parameters of the models. Further, outputs of the different wavelet-ANN models are combined using the least square boosting ensemble and Bates-Granger techniques to achieve more accurate and more reliable forecasts. To examine the efficiency and reliability of the proposed models for different lead times, uncertainty analysis is conducted for the best single wavelet-ANN and ensemble models as well. The results indicate that accurate forecasts of water temperature and salinity up to three days ahead can be achieved using the ensemble models. Increasing the time horizon, the reliability and accuracy of the models decrease. Ensemble models are found to be superior to the best single models for both forecasting variables and for all the three lead times. The results of this study are promising with respect to multi-step forecasting of water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a and salinity, important indicators of ecosystem status in coastal and ocean regions.",https://doi.org/10.1080/19942060.2018.1553742,"Shamshirband, S; Nodoushan, EJ; Adolf, JE; Manaf, AA; Mosavi, A; Chau, KW",2019,Article,Eng.

449,An assessment of the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations in Chesapeake Bay using a machine learning model,"Subseasonal to seasonal forecasts have the potential to be a useful tool for managing estuarine fisheries and water quality, and with increasing skill at forecasting conditions at these time scales in the atmosphere and open ocean, skillful forecasts of estuarine salinity, temperature, and biogeochemistry may be possible. In this study, we use a machine learning model to assess the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay at a monthly time scale. Compared to previous models for dissolved oxygen and hypoxia, our model has the advantages of resolving spatial variability and fitting more flexible relationships between dissolved oxygen and the predictor variables. Using a concise set of predictors with established relationships with dissolved oxygen, we find that dissolved oxygen in a given month can be skillfully predicted with knowledge of stratification and mean temperature during the same month. Furthermore, the predictions generated by the model are consistent with expectations from prior knowledge and basic physics. The model reveals that accurate knowledge or skillful forecasts of the vertical density gradient is the key to successful prediction of dissolved oxygen, and prediction skill disappears if stratification is only known at the beginning of the forecast. The lost skill cannot be recovered by replacing stratification as a predictor with variables that have a lagged correlation with stratification (such as river discharge); however, skill is obtainable in many cases if stratification can be forecast with an error of less than about 1 kg m(-3). Thus, future research on hypoxia forecasting should focus on understanding and forecasting variations in stratification over subseasonal time scales (between about two weeks and two months).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.03.007,"Ross, AC; Stock, CA",2019,Article,Estuar.

In the old system, pollen emission from the oak was estimated just based on the airborne concentration and meteorology factors, resulted in high uncertainty. For improving the quality of current pollen forecasting system, therefore the estimation of pollen emission is now corrected based on the observation of pollen emission at the oak forest to better reflect the real emission pattern. In this study, the performance of the previous (NIMS2014) and current (NIMS2016) model system was compared using observed oak pollen concentration. Daily pollen concentrations and emissions were simulated in pollen season 2016 and accuracy of onset and end of pollen season were evaluated. In the NIMS2014 model, pollen season was longer than actual pollen season; The simulated pollen season started 6 days earlier and finished 13.25 days later than the actual pollen season. The NIMS2016 model, however, the simulated pollen season started only 1.83 days later, and finished 0.25 days later than the actual pollen season, showing the improvement to predict the temporal range of pollen events. Also, the NIMS2016 model shows better performance for the prediction of pollen concentration, while there is a still large uncertainty to capture the maximum pollen concentration at the target site.

Here we analyze results of the yearlong replicated mesocosm experiment with multi-species plankton community that allowed revealing signs of chaos at different trophic levels in strictly controlled abiotic environment. In mesocosms without external stressors, we observed the ""paradox of chaos"" when biotic interactions (internal drivers) were acting as generators of internal abiotic triggers of complex plankton dynamics. Chaos was registered as episodes that vanished unpredictably or were substituted by complex behaviour of other candidates when longer time series were considered. Remarkably, episodes of chaos were detected even in the most abiotically stable conditions. We developed the Integral Chaos Indicator to validate the results of the Lyapunov exponent analysis.

Model performance was evaluated using several performance criteria and additional investigation of low and high flows was carried out. The results of the study indicate that the Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier (GR4J) lumped conceptual model yielded better modelling performance compared to the data-driven models, namely ANN, DNN and RT models. Moreover, the enhanced version of the GR4J model (i.e. GR6J) also yielded good performance in terms of the recession part. The RT model yielded the worst performance regarding runoff forecasting among the examined models in the case of all five investigated catchments. However, ANN and DNN data-driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the hydrograph recession in the case of karst sub-catchments compared to the GR4J lumped conceptual model structure.

471,Enhanced time series predictability with well-defined structures,"For any given time series, how to optimize its forecast strategies and what prediction model is adopted are of great importance. In order to reach this goal, insight from analyzing predictability of series with known structure information is necessary. Time series generated by theoretical models with four kinds of known predictive structures, i.e., short-term correlation, long-term correlation, and multifractal and chaotic patterns, are applied to demonstrate that there is a well-defined relation between series' intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy of any specific prediction model. And results show that both intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy are enhanced by these well-defined structures. There are different regimes in the relation between intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy for series with different known deterministic or stochastic predictive structures. These regimes in the relation between intrinsic predictability and prediction accuracy can guide us to preselect a suitable prediction model and forecast strategies for any underlying series by only analyzing the permutation entropy of a given series. Results from three pieces of climate series further confirm that insights from theoretical series with known structure information indeed work well.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02836-6,"Huang, Y; Fu, ZT",2019,Article,Theor.

22,Drought reduces tree growing season length but increases nitrogen resorption efficiency in a Mediterranean ecosystem,"Mediterranean ecosystems are hotspots for climate change, as the highest impacts are forecasted for the Mediterranean region, mainly by more frequent and intense severe droughts. Plant phenology is a good indicator of species' responses to climate change. In this study, we compared the spring phenology of cork oak trees (Quercus suber), an evergreen species, over 2 contrasting years, a mild year (2004) and a dry year (2005), which was the most severe drought since records exist. We evaluated the timing of occurrence, duration, and intensity of bud development, budburst, shoot elongation, trunk growth, and leaf senescence (phenophases) and assessed the nitrogen resorption efficiency from senescent to green leaves. The temperature was the main driver of budburst. Nevertheless, water had the main role of constraining all the other phenophases by strongly reducing the growing season length (-48 %) and consequently the tree growth. Basal area increment was the most affected growth variable (-36 %), although it occurred at a similar rate in the 2 years. Shoot elongation was also reduced (-21 %), yet elongation occurred at a higher rate in the dry year compared to the mild year. Leaf senescence during the bulk period was higher in the dry year, in which leaves were shed at the same rate over a longer period. Nitrogen concentrations in green and senescent leaves were affected by drought and nitrogen resorption efficiency increased remarkably (+22 %). Our results highlight the importance of studying different phenological metrics to improve our understanding of the ecosystem's responses to climate change. The faster dynamics observed in shoot elongation, while all other phenophases developed at the same rate, indicate that leaf area development is privileged in cork oak. Water availability was the main driver of spring growth in this Mediterranean ecosystem; however, growth may be affected by complex interplays between precipitation and temperature, such as higher temperatures during dry winters or heatwaves during spring, that are likely to result in water stress. Longer studies are needed to disentangle those interplays. Finally, a higher nitrogen resorption efficiency in response to drought appears to be an adaptive trait that mitigates the limitation in nitrogen uptake by the roots during drought and contributes to improving tree fitness in the short term but will probably exert a negative feedback on the nitrogen cycle in the long term, which might affect the ecosystem functioning under the forecasted droughts.",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1265-2019,"Lobo-do-Vale, R; Besson, CK; Caldeira, MC; Chaves, MM; Pereira, JS",2019,Article,Biogeosciences,English,abby lewis,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
72,"Behaviour, life history and persistence in novel environments","Understanding what affects population growth in novel environments is fundamental to forecast organisms' responses to global change, including biological invasions and land use intensification. Novel environments are challenging because they can cause maladaptation, increasing the risk of extinction by negative population growth. Animals can avoid extinction by improving the phenotype-environment match through behavioural responses, notably matching habitat choice and learning. However, the demographic consequences of these responses remain insufficiently understood in part because they have not been analysed within a life-history context. By means of an individual-based model, we show here that matching habitat choice and learning interact with life history to influence persistence in novel environments. In maladaptive contexts, the likelihood of persisting is higher for life-history strategies that increase the value of adults over the value of offspring, even at the cost of decreasing reproduction. Such a strategy facilitates persistence in novel environments by reducing the costs of a reproductive failure while increasing the benefits of behavioural responses. Our results reinforce the view that a more predictive theory for extinction risk under rapid environmental changes requires considering behavioural responses and life history as part of a common adaptive strategy to cope with environmental changes.

It is assumed that the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity of algal blooms is determined by divergence/convergence processes in the fluid medium. To address this issue, three episodes of the dominant spatial patterns of hourly simulated divergence fields of current in Lake Taihu in July of 2012 were analyzed using a hydrodynamic numerical model combined with the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) method. The results showed that, on days that blooms occurred, the first two EOF modes explained 89.4% of the variability and the dominant spatial patterns of stronger convergence zones were in agreement with the regions of bloom occurrence and accumulation. When no blooms occurred, the first EOF mode explained 72.5% of the variability and divergence zones were dominant in the lake. Both the simulated hourly average divergence field and the first EOF mode in the time interval in which blooms occurred further confirmed that blooms accumulate in the current convergence zones. These findings explain the dynamic mechanism of occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and will facilitate forecasting of short-term blooms for protecting drinking water supplies and managing risk.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-3883-1,"Li, W; Qin, BQ",2019,Article,Hydrobiologia,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA

234,Improving estimates and forecasts of lake carbon dynamics using data assimilation,"Lakes are biogeochemical hotspots on the landscape, contributing significantly to the global carbon cycle despite their small areal coverage. Observations and models of lake carbon pools and fluxes are rarely explicitly combined through data assimilation despite successful use of this technique in other fields. Data assimilation adds value to both observations and models by constraining models with observations of the system and by leveraging knowledge of the system formalized by the model to objectively fill observation gaps. In this article, we highlight the utility of data assimilation in lake carbon cycling research by using the ensemble Kalman filter to combine simple lake carbon models with observations of lake carbon pools and fluxes. We demonstrate that data assimilation helps reduce uncertainty in estimates of lake carbon pools and fluxes and more accurately estimate the true carbon pool size compared to estimates derived from observations alone. Data assimilation techniques should be embraced as valuable tools for lake biogeochemists interested in learning about ecosystem dynamics and forecasting ecosystem states and processes.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10302,"Zwart, JA; Hararuk, O; Prairie, YT; Jones, SE; Solomon, CT",2019,Article,Limnol.

103,Comparison of meteorological and satellite-based drought indices as yield predictors of Spanish cereals,"In the context of global warming, as drought episodes become increasingly frequent, it is crucial to accurately measure the impacts of droughts on the overall performance of agrosystems. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite-based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale. The analysis is conducted in Spain using a spatially detailed, 12-year (2003-2015) dataset on crop yields, including different types of cereals. Yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), computed at different temporal aggregation levels, and two satellite-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area. Models resting on satellite-based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated. In particular, VCI/TCI models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70% and 40% of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability, respectively. We also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones (instead of models at the national scale) were considered. All the results were cross-validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real-time forecasting exercise. Results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite-based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems (e.g. agricultural drought early warning systems, crop yield forecasting models or water resource management tools) complementing meteorological drought indices derived from precipitation grids.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.10.030,"Garcia-Leon, D; Contreras, S; Hunink, J",2019,Article,Agric.

411,Assessing the Vulnerability of Aquatic Macroinvertebrates to Climate Warming in a Mountainous Watershed: Supplementing Presence-Only Data with Species Traits,"Mountainous running water ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change with major changes coming from warming temperatures. Species distribution will be affected and some species are anticipated to be winners (increasing their range) or losers (at risk of extinction). Climate change vulnerability is seldom integrated when assessing threat status for lists of species at risk (Red Lists), even though this might appear an important addition in the current context. The main objective of our study was to assess the potential vulnerability of Ephemeroptera (E), Plecoptera (P) and Trichoptera (T) species to global warming in a Swiss mountainous region by supplementing Species Distribution Models (SDMs) with a trait-based approach, using available historical occurrence and environmental data and to compare our outcomes with the Swiss National Red List. First, we used nine different modelling techniques and topographic, land use, climatic and hydrological variables as predictors of EPT species distribution. The shape of the response curves of the species for the environmental variables in the nine modelling techniques, together with three biological and ecological traits were used to assess the potential vulnerability of each species to climate change. The joint use of SDMs and trait approach appeared complementary and even though discrepancies were highlighted between SDMs and trait analyses, groups of potential winners and losers were raised out. Plecoptera appeared as the most vulnerable group to global warming. Divergences between current threat status of species and our results pointed out the need to integrate climate change vulnerability in Red List assessments.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11040636,"Besacier Monbertrand, AL; Timoner, P; Rahman, K; Burlando, P; Fatichi, S; Gonseth, Y; Moser, F; Castella, E; Lehmann, A",2019,Article,Water,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,1,NA,,,NA
245,Quantifying uncertainty about future antimicrobial resistance: Comparing structured expert judgment and statistical forecasting methods,"The increase of multidrug resistance and resistance to last-line antibiotics is a major global public health threat. Although surveillance programs provide useful current and historical information on the scale of the problem, the future emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is uncertain, and quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for guiding decisions about investment in antibiotics and resistance control strategies. Mathematical and statistical models capable of projecting future rates are challenged by the paucity of data and the complexity of the emergence and spread of resistance, but experts have relevant knowledge. We use the Classical Model of structured expert judgment to elicit projections with uncertainty bounds of resistance rates through 2026 for nine pathogen-antibiotic pairs in four European countries and empirically validate the assessments against data on a set of calibration questions. The performance-weighted combination of experts in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom projected that resistance for five pairs on the World Health Organization's priority pathogens list (E. coli and K. pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems and MRSA) would remain below 50% in 2026. In Italy, although upper bounds of 90% credible ranges exceed 50% resistance for some pairs, the medians suggest Italy will sustain or improve its current rates. We compare these expert projections to statistical forecasts based on historical data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). Results from the statistical models differ from each other and from the judgmental forecasts in many cases. The judgmental forecasts include information from the experts about the impact of current and future shifts in infection control, antibiotic usage, and other factors that cannot be easily captured in statistical forecasts, demonstrating the potential of structured expert judgment as a tool for better understanding the uncertainty about future antibiotic resistance.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219190,"Colson, AR; Megiddo, I; Alvarez-Uria, G; Gandra, S; Bedford, T; Morton, A; Cooke, RM; Laxminarayan, R",2019,Article,PLoS One,English,mary lofton,NA,1,0,1,NA,,,NA
468,Assimilating multi-source data into a three-dimensional hydro-ecological dynamics model using Ensemble Kalman Filter,"Accurately predicting spatio-temporal patterns of algal bloom is important and also challenging. This study developed a three-dimensional hydro-ecological dynamics model (3DHED) to predict cyanobacterial biomass in lakes and applied Ensemble Kalman Filter to assimilate multi-source data into 3DHED for model improvement. The model was applied in Lake Taihu, using in-situ measurements and remote sensing (RS) retrievals. Two data assimilation experiments (named EnKF1 and EnKF2) were conducted. EnKF1 assimilated only in-situ measurements, while EnKF2 assimilated both in-situ measurements and RS data. The results revealed that 3DHED simulated the spatio-temporal patterns of cyanobacterial biomass in Taihu with an acceptable Index of Agreement (IOA). EnKF1 significantly improved the model fitness and increased the IOA of 85% measurement sites to 0.85, especially better captured the peak values. Compared with EnKF1, EnKF2 gave more improvements in spatial patterns besides model fitness, implying that assimilating multi-source data was helpful to improving the model performance.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.03.028,"Chen, C; Huang, JC; Chen, QW; Zhang, JY; Li, ZJ; Lin, YQ",2019,Article,Environ.

The aim of this study is comparing the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) model, wavelet-based artificial neural network (WANN) model and GR4J lumped daily conceptual model for rainfall-runoff modelling of two rivers in the USA. It was obtained that the performance of the data-driven models (ANN, WANN) is better than the GR4J model especially when streamflow data the preceding day (Q(t-1)) and streamflow data the preceding two days (Q(t-2)) are used as input data in the ANN and WANN models for the simulation of low and high flows, in particular. On the other hand, when only precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are used as input variables, the GR4J model performs better than the data-driven models.",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2018.189,"Sezen, C; Partal, T",2019,Article,Water Sci.

254,Toward building a transparent statistical model for improving crop yield prediction: Modeling rainfed corn in the U.S,"Statistical crop models have been a major tool in identifying critical drivers of crop yield, forecasting short-term crop yield, and assessing long-term climate change impacts on agricultural productivity. However, few studies focus specifically on fundamental issues encountered in developing a high-performance statistical crop model for yield prediction. Such issues include: how to select predictors and fitting functions, how to effectively address the spatiotemporal scale issue, weather it is beneficial to include satellite data as explanatory variables, and how to reconcile different model evaluation procedures. In this study, we present our statistical modeling practices for predicting rainfed corn yield in the Midwest U.S. and address the aforementioned issues through comprehensive diagnostic analysis. Our results show that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation at a monthly scale, in spline form with customized knots, define the ""Best Climate-only"" model among alternative climate variables (e.g., air temperature) and fitting functions (e.g., linear or polynomial), with an out-of-sample (leave-one-year out) median R-2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 1.04 t/ha (16.6 bu/acre) from 2003 to 2016. Satellite variables, such as MODIS land surface temperature and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when used as predictors alone, reduce the model's RMSE to 0.93 t/ha (14.8 bu/acre). Adding satellite variables (i.e., EVI in polynomial form) to the ""Best Climate-only"" model gives the ""Best Climate + EVI"" model, which has the highest prediction performance of this study, with a median R-2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.90 t/ha (14.3 bu/acre). Such a model trained using all data (so-called ""global model"") in most cases leads to better predictions than the state-specific trained models. However, the global model's prediction performance exhibits considerable regional and interannual variations. The regional-varying performance is related to states' spatiotemporal variability in yield, where states with larger spatial yield variability show higher R-2, and states with smaller temporal yield variability show lower RMSE. Interannual variations in prediction performance are linked to yield variability and degree of wetness, with higher R-2 in years with larger yield variability but increasingly larger RMSE toward wetter years and extreme dry years. These identified spatial and temporal variations of model's performance, together with inconsistent evaluation practices undermine the comparability between statistical modeling studies. Alleviating such comparability issues requires more transparency and open data practices. The statistical model presented in this study provides a benchmark for further development and can be applied to future research related to yield prediction or assessment of climate change impact.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.02.005,"Li, Y; Guan, KY; Yu, A; Peng, B; Zhao, L; Li, B; Peng, J",2019,Article,Field Crop.

222,Batch-processing of AquaCrop plug-in for rainfed maize using satellite derived Fractional Vegetation Cover data,"Coupling crop growth models and remote sensing data has shown great potential to improve crop yield and biomass forecasting. However, few such applications are used at field level. In this study, the plug-in version of AquaCrop, a water driven model initially designed for conditions in which water is the limiting factor in crop production, was adapted to assess maize in Belgium. Field campaigns were organised in 2015, 2016 and 2017, during which ground measurements were collected. At field level and under rainfed conditions, above ground total dry biomass and field management information (crop density, planting dates, biomass measurements etc.) was collected. Green fractional vegetation cover (fCover) data were retrieved from high spatial and temporal satellite images (DMC-2/ DEIMOS-1 and Sentinel-2). Maximum canopy cover and emergence date were derived from the time series and assimilated into AquaCrop. The model was calibrated with the 2015-2016 dataset and validated with 2017 data. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the biomass assessment was 0.7 ton/ha and the R-2 reached 0.85. The R-2 between the canopy cover simulated by the model and the remotely sensed fCover ranged from 0.76-0.98 in most of the cases. To simultaneously run and evaluate the ensemble of field-level simulations, a semi-automated R-environment was developed. This robust and automated approach offers vast potential for large-scale field-level yield assessments for temperate as well as tropical conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.03.016,"Sallah, AHM; Tychon, B; Piccard, I; Gobin, A; Van Hoolst, R; Djaby, B; Wellens, J",2019,Article,Agric.

57,Lidar-Derived Tree Crown Parameters: Are They New Variables Explaining Local Birch (Betula sp.) Pollen Concentrations?,"Birch trees are abundant in central and northern Europe and are dominant trees in broadleaved forests. Birches are pioneer trees that produce large quantities of allergenic pollen efficiently dispersed by wind. The pollen load level depends on the sizes and locations of pollen sources, which are important for pollen forecasting models; however, very limited work has been done on this topic in comparison to research on anthropogenic air pollutants. Therefore, we used highly accurate aerial laser scanning (Light Detection and Ranging-LiDAR) data to estimate the size and location of birch pollen sources in 3-dimensional space and to determine their influence on the pollen concentration in Poznan, Poland. LiDAR data were acquired in May 2012. LiDAR point clouds were clipped to birch individuals (mapped in 2012-2014 and in 2019), normalised, filtered, and individual tree crowns higher than 5 m were delineated. Then, the crown surface and volume were calculated and aggregated according to wind direction up to 2 km from the pollen trap. Consistent with LIDAR data, hourly airborne pollen measurements (performed using a Hirst-type, 7-day volumetric trap), wind speed and direction data were obtained in April 2012. We delineated 18,740 birch trees, with an average density of 14.9/0.01 km(2), in the study area. The total birch crown surface in the 500-1500 m buffer from the pollen trap was significantly correlated with the pollen concentration aggregated by the wind direction (r = 0.728, p = 0.04). The individual tree crown delineation performed well (r(2) >= 0.89), but overestimations were observed at high birch densities (> 30 trees/plot). We showed that trees outside forests substantially contribute to the total pollen pool. We suggest that including the vertical dimension and the trees outside the forest in pollen source maps have the potential to improve the quality of pollen forecasting models.",https://doi.org/10.3390/f10121154,"Bogawski, P; Grewling, L; Dziob, K; Sobieraj, K; Dalc, M; Dylawerska, B; Pupkowski, D; Nalej, A; Nowak, M; Szymanska, A; Kostecki, L; Nowak, MM; Jackowiak, B",2019,Article,Forests,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
127,Predicting the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by training a crop growth model with historical data,"Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an important remote measurement in agriculture because it has a high correlation with crop growth and yield result. In this paper, we present a methodology to predict the NDVI by training a crop growth model with historical data. Although we use a very simple soybean growth model, the methodology could be extended to other crops and more complex models. The training process is an optimization problem, that is solved using the spectral projected gradient method. The quality of the prediction is measured by computing the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) between predicted and true values, obtaining an error lower than 9%, which improves the results obtained by simple forecast techniques used as baseline estimators.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.04.028,"Berger, A; Ettlin, G; Quincke, C; Rodriguez-Bocca, P",2019,Article; Proceedings Paper,Comput.

297,Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay: Operational In Situ Prediction and Forecast Models Can Benefit from Inclusion of Lagged Water Quality Measurements,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis. Given its natural presence in brackish waters, there is a need to develop operational forecast models that can sufficiently predict the bacterium's spatial and temporal variation. This work attempted to develop V. parahaemolyticus prediction models using frequently measured time-indexed and -lagged water quality measures. Models were built using a large data set (n = 1,043) of surface water samples from 2007 to 2010 previously analyzed for V. parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay. Water quality variables were classified as time indexed, 1-month lag, and 2-month lag. Tobit regression models were used to account for V. parahaemolyticus measures below the limit of quantification and to simultaneously estimate the presence and abundance of the bacterium. Models were evaluated using cross-validation and metrics that quantify prediction bias and uncertainty. Presence classification models containing only one type of water quality parameter (e.g., temperature) performed poorly, while models with additional water quality parameters (i.e., salinity, clarity, and dissolved oxygen) performed well. Lagged variable models performed similarly to time-indexed models, and lagged variables occasionally contained a predictive power that was independent of or superior to that of time-indexed variables. Abundance estimation models were less effective, primarily due to a restricted number of samples with abundances above the limit of quantification. These findings indicate that an operational in situ prediction model is attainable but will require a variety of water quality measurements and that lagged measurements will be particularly useful for forecasting. Future work will expand variable selection for prediction models and extend the spatial-temporal extent of predictions by using geostatistical interpolation techniques. IMPORTANCE Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the leading causes of seafood-borne illness in the United States and across the globe. Exposure often occurs from the consumption of raw shellfish. Despite public health concerns, there have been only sporadic efforts to develop environmental prediction and forecast models for the bacterium preharvest. This analysis used commonly sampled water quality measurements of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and clarity to develop models for V. parahaemolyticus in surface water. Predictors also included measurements taken months before water was tested for the bacterium. Results revealed that the use of multiple water quality measurements is necessary for satisfactory prediction performance, challenging current efforts to manage the risk of infection based upon water temperature alone. The results also highlight the potential advantage of including historical water quality measurements. This analysis shows promise and lays the groundwork for future operational prediction and forecast models.",https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01007-19,"Davis, BJK; Jacobs, JM; Zaitchik, B; DePaola, A; Curriero, FC",2019,Article,Appl.

307,Making Recursive Bayesian Inference Accessible,"Bayesian models provide recursive inference naturally because they can formally reconcile new data and existing scientific information. However, popular use of Bayesian methods often avoids priors that are based on exact posterior distributions resulting from former studies. Two existing Recursive Bayesian methods are: Prior- and Proposal-Recursive Bayes. Prior-Recursive Bayes uses Bayesian updating, fitting models to partitions of data sequentially, and provides a way to accommodate new data as they become available using the posterior from the previous stage as the prior in the new stage based on the latest data. Proposal-Recursive Bayes is intended for use with hierarchical Bayesian models and uses a set of transient priors in first stage independent analyses of the data partitions. The second stage of Proposal-Recursive Bayes uses the posteriors from the first stage as proposals in a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit the full model. We combine Prior- and Proposal-Recursive concepts to fit any Bayesian model, and often with computational improvements. We demonstrate our method with two case studies. Our approach has implications for big data, streaming data, and optimal adaptive design situations.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1665584,"Hooten, MB; Johnson, DS; Brost, BM",2019,Article; Early Access,Am.

211,A Simple Finite Difference-Based Approximation for Biogeochemical Tangent Linear and Adjoint Models,"We present a technique that accurately approximates tangent linear and adjoint models for data assimilation applications using only evaluations of the nonlinear model. The approximation offers a simple way to create tangent linear and adjoint model codes that are easily maintainable, as only major changes to the nonlinear model formulation necessitate modifications of the tangent linear or adjoint model code. The approach is particularly well suited to marine biogeochemical models and takes advantage of typical features of these types of models to be computationally viable. We illustrate the approximation in a realistic application, using a three-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical 4D-Var data assimilation system, set in the California Current system, in which the approximation is only applied to the 11 state variable biogeochemical model. In this application, the approximation-based model solution tracks the reference solution accurately over thirty 4-day assimilation cycles but leads to a similar to 10% increase in the computational cost compared to the hand-coded reference. Plain Language Summary Data assimilation refers to the process by which computer simulations of the Earth's atmosphere or ocean are constrained by measured data to be closer to the natural system. For example, in weather forecasting, measurements of the atmosphere are used to improve the computer model-generated forecast. Many data assimilation applications require extra computer code to calculate the appropriate adjustments shifting the model toward observations. This data assimilation code is time consuming to build; it must be updated whenever changes are made to the model code. We describe a relatively easy way to automatically generate the data assimilation code using only the underlying model code. Using this method, changes to the model code are automatically propagated to the data assimilation code. Although this approach is simple to construct and maintain, it comes at a cost of increased computer execution time. It is therefore not sensible for all computer models. We show that our approach is useful for marine biological models that simulate biological and chemical interactions in the ocean. For our biological model of the U.S. west coast, the automatically generated data assimilation code takes 10% longer to run than the assimilation code created by hand and results in functionally equivalent results.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014283,"Mattern, JP; Edwards, CA",2019,Article,J.

398,Management implications of modelling fisheries recruitment,"The representation and parameterisation of the stock-recruitment relationship is highly influential in fisheries stock assessments. We overview important management implications arising from choices and assumptions made when modelling recruitment and propose pragmatic solutions. An age-structured population model is used to highlight some additional considerations including (1) incorrect assumptions about the source of recruits and (2) ways to account for environmental correlates in stock assessment models, either directly or indirectly. Existing stationary approaches ignore the sometimes considerable influence of the environment on population processes such as recruitment, growth and mortality, all of which are expected to shift under changing climate. We show that where environmental relationships are explicitly included in models, they need to be rigorously assessed and model parameterization carefully evaluated. Variability in annual recruitment estimates (specified by the standard deviation sigma(R)) must be adjusted to control the partitioning of total variation into environmental and unexplained variation, as reference point estimates are particularly sensitive to the choice of sigma(R). Finally, we evaluate two recommended solutions to these issues: Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) that are robust to recruitment uncertainty and variability, and empirical HCRs that use pre-season survey inputs as a way to more directly provide forecasts without needing to quantify the complex underlying details of the environmental-recruitment relationships.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.007,"Plaganyi, EE; Haywood, MDE; Gorton, RJ; Siple, MC; Deng, RA",2019,Article,Fish Res.,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
118,Dynamical evidence for causality between Northern Hemisphere annular mode and winter surface air temperature over Northeast Asia,"Past results [Thompson and Wallace in Geophys Res Lett 25(9):1297-1300, 1998; Science 293(5527):85-89, 2001; Wallace and Thompson in J Clim 15(14):1987-1991, 2002a] indicate that over the Eurasian continent, North America, and East Asia, wintertime surface temperatures tend to be warmer (colder) on high-index (low-index) Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM). However, a linear correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causality between them. Here, we apply a recently developed method, convergent cross mapping (CCM), to examine the causal connections between NAM and wintertime surface air temperature (SAT) over Northeast Asia. Our analysis indicates that both NAM and SAT exhibit nonlinear dynamical structure and that NAM information is encoded in the SAT data but not the other way around. This indicates a causality between them in the direction NAMSAT. This result opens the possibility to use the NAM index as the external driving factor to forecast winter SAT over Northeast Asia.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4317-x,"Zhang, NN; Wang, G; Tsonis, AA",2019,Article,Clim.

312,Herbarium specimens reveal substantial and unexpected variation in phenological sensitivity across the eastern United States,"Phenology is a key biological trait that can determine an organism's survival and provides one of the clearest indicators of the effects of recent climatic change. Long time-series observations of plant phenology collected at continental scales could clarify latitudinal and regional patterns of plant responses and illuminate drivers of that variation, but few such datasets exist. Here, we use the web tool CrowdCurio to crowdsource phenological data from over 7000 herbarium specimens representing 30 diverse flowering plant species distributed across the eastern United States. Our results, spanning 120 years and generated from over 2000 crowdsourcers, illustrate numerous aspects of continental-scale plant reproductive phenology. First, they support prior studies that found plant reproductive phenology significantly advances in response to warming, especially for early-flowering species. Second, they reveal that fruiting in populations from warmer, lower latitudes is significantly more phenologically sensitive to temperature than that for populations from colder, higher-latitude regions. Last, we found that variation in phenological sensitivities to climate within species between regions was of similar magnitude to variation between species. Overall, our results suggest that phenological responses to anthropogenic climate change will be heterogeneous within communities and across regions, with large amounts of regional variability driven by local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and differences in species assemblages. As millions of imaged herbarium specimens become available online, they will play an increasingly critical role in revealing large-scale patterns within assemblages and across continents that ultimately can improve forecasts of the impacts of climatic change on the structure and function of ecosystems.

394,Using reanalysis in crop monitoring and forecasting systems,"Weather observations are essential for crop monitoring and forecasting but they are not always available and in some cases they have limited spatial representativeness. Thus, reanalyses represent an alternative source of information to be explored. In this study, we assess the feasibility of reanalysis-based crop monitoring and forecasting by using the system developed and maintained by the European Commission- Joint Research Centre, its gridded daily meteorological observations, the biased-corrected reanalysis AgMERRA and the ERA-Interim reanalysis. We focus on Europe and on two crops, wheat and maize, in the period 1980-2010 under potential and water-limited conditions. In terms of inter-annual yield correlation at the country scale, the reanalysis-driven systems show a very good performance for both wheat and maize (with correlation values higher than 0.6 in almost all EU28 countries) when compared to the observations-driven system. However, significant yield biases affect both crops. All simulations show similar correlations with respect to the FAO reported yield time series. These findings support the integration of reanalyses in current crop monitoring and forecasting systems and point to the emerging opportunities linked to the coming availability of higher-resolution reanalysis updated at near real time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.07.001,"Toreti, A; Maiorano, A; De Sanctis, G; Webber, H; Ruane, AC; Fumagalli, D; Ceglar, A; Niemeyer, S; Zampieri, M",2019,Article,Agric.

1,Predicting Lake Quality for the Next Generation: Impacts of Catchment Management and Climatic Factors in a Probabilistic Model Framework,"Lake ecosystems across the world are under combined pressures of eutrophication and climate change, which increase the risk of harmful cyanobacteria blooms, reduced ecological status, and degraded ecosystem services. In Europe, the third cycle of river basin management plans (2021-2027) according to the Water Framework Directive must take into account the potential impacts of climate change on water quality, including effects on relevant biological indicators. Here, we applied a Bayesian network as a meta-model for linking future climate and land-use scenarios for the time horizon 2050-2070, via process-based catchment and lake models, to cyanobacteria abundance and ecological status of a eutrophic lake. Building upon previous applications of the model, a new version was developed to include relevant climatic variables such as wind speed. Explorative scenarios showed that the combination of low wind and high temperature gave the most synergistic effects on cyanobacteria under high levels of eutrophication (Chl-a concentration). Considering the management target of good ecological status, however, the climate-related promotion of cyanobacteria blooms contributed most to degrading the ecological status at intermediate levels of eutrophication. Future developments of this model will aim to strengthen the link between climate variables and ecological responses, to make the model also useful for seasonal forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091767,"Moe, SJ; Couture, RM; Haande, S; Solheim, AL; Jackson-Blake, L",2019,Article,Water,English,abby lewis,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
146,"Predicting the potential distribution of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Kuwayama), in China using the MaxEnt model","Background: Citrus huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease of citrus and a major threat to the citrus industry around the world. This disease accounts for substantial economic losses in China every year. Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is one of the major vectors by which citrus HLB is spread under natural conditions in China. Research is needed to identify the geographic distribution of D. citri and its major areas of occurrence and to formulate measures for early warning, monitoring, and control of this pest and citrus HLB. Methods: In this study, the ecological niche modelling software MaxEnt (maximum entropy model) was combined with ArcGIS (a geographic information system) to predict the potential geographic distribution of D. citri in China. Key environmental factors and the appropriate ranges of their values were also investigated. Results: Our results show that the training data provided a good forecast (AUC(mean) = 0.988). The highly suitable areas for D. citri in China are mainly concentrated to the south of the Yangtze River, and the total area is 139.83 x 10(4) km(2). The area of the moderately suitable areas is 27.71 x 10(4) km(2), with a narrower distribution than that of the highly suitable area. The important environmental factors affecting the distribution of D. citri were min temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, mean temperature of warmest quarter, precipitation of warmest quarter, max temperature of warmest month, and temperature seasonality. These results provide a valuable theoretical basis for risk assessments and control of D. citri. Discussion: The predicted results showed that there were highly suitable areas for D. citri in Chongqing, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Therefore, the possibility exists for the further spread of D. citri in China in the future. Extreme temperature variables, especially the min temperature of the coldest month, play an important role in the distribution of D. citri and are most closely related to the distribution of D. citri.",https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7323,"Wang, RL; Yang, H; Luo, W; Wang, MT; Lu, XL; Huang, TT; Zhao, JP; Li, Q",2019,Article,PeerJ,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA

In this study, an ensemble species distribution model was developed for the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), by using 188 worldwide occurrence records and 11 environmental variables to predict its global potential distribution in freshwater habitats. The ensemble model showed high predictive performance and indicated that annual mean temperature was the most important environmental variable that limits the distribution of this invasive crustacean. The model successfully predicted the known distribution of Chinese mitten crab in its native range and invasive ranges and suggested that this invader has not yet fully realized its potential distribution in Europe and North America. The model also predicted some additional suitable areas where this crab has not yet been observed (Japan, part of South America, Australia, and New Zealand). Management strategies are proposed to control this invasive crab in light of these results.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3749-y,"Zhang, ZX; Capinha, C; Weterings, R; McLay, CL; Xi, D; Lu, HJ; Yu, LY",2019,Article,Hydrobiologia,English,mary lofton,NA,0,1,1,NA,,,NA
167,Uncertainty of Carbon Economy Using the Faustmann Model,"Forest growth predictions are used to build expectations about the future economic performance of management decisions. Faustmann land expectation value (LEV) is a widely used criterion in forestry to evaluate a diversity of decision parameters, such as rotation age and thinning regimes. Most of the predictions and, consequently, expectations are based on emperical knowledge, assuming a steady state in climate and a deterministic forest growth approach. However, the climate may change to potentially different degrees in the coming decades, causing a dynamic and uncertain forest growth and carbon budget. Moreover, carbon economy in forestry, defined as opportunity cost of in situ carbon sequestration, can hardly be analysed using empirical models and calls for process-based forest biomass production models. Process-based models include numerous parameters and processes that embody some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty of these parameters and climate state propagates over time to the final decision about carbon economy and optimal management solutions. Here we quantify this uncertainty using Bayesian inference and apply twelve different climate change scenarios to evaluate the forecasts of the process-based forest model 3-PG, to predict the growth of European beech (Fagus Sylvatica) in central european conditions as an example. The results show a strong influence of the model's parameters uncertainty on the final decisions about timber based and carbon economy. The uncertainty triples if different climate change scenarios are applied as a source of deep uncertainty where no probability can be assigned to any scenario. To deal with deep uncertainty, a robust decision-making approach has been applied to find solutions with minimum regret or maximum value at risk regarding all scenarios. We conclude that communicating uncertainty is a fundamental issue for forestry economics under changing climate conditions, especially if carbon sequestration is an asset. The key message for designing global forest governance policy in the uncertain times of climate change will be the necessity to take into account both the uncertainty on the demand side, that is, socio-economic developments and regional population needs for forest ecosystem services such as wood, but also the uncertainty of the supply side and the inherent ecological uncertainties in predicting the forests' growth, resources, and climatic conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1561/112.00000444,"Yousefpour, R; Augustynczik, ALD",2019,Article,J.

467,Realistic fisheries management reforms could mitigate the impacts of climate change in most countries,"Although climate change is altering the productivity and distribution of marine fisheries, climate-adaptive fisheries management could mitigate many of the negative impacts on human society. We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60-65% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-asusual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing-and achieving the benefits of-climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224347,"Free, CM; Mangin, T; Molinos, JG; Ojea, E; Burden, M; Costello, C; Gaines, SD",2020,Article,PLoS One,English,rachel corrigan,NA,0,1,1,NA,abby lewis,Long term.

However, as an ecological process evolves, we need statistical models that can adapt to changing dynamics as new data are collected. We developed a model that combines an ecological diffusion equation and logistic growth to characterize colonization processes of a population that establishes long-term equilibrium over a heterogeneous environment. We also developed a homogenization strategy to statistically upscale the PDE for faster computation and adopted a hierarchical framework to accommodate multiple data sources collected at different spatial scales. We highlighted the advantages of using a logistic reaction component instead of a Malthusian component when population growth demonstrates asymptotic behavior. As a case study, we demonstrated that our model improves spatiotemporal abundance forecasts of sea otters in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Furthermore, we predicted spatially varying local equilibrium abundances as a result of environmentally driven diffusion and density-regulated growth. Integrating equilibrium abundances over the study area in our application enabled us to infer the overall carrying capacity of sea otters in Glacier Bay, Alaska.",https://doi.org/10.1002/env.2604,"Lu, XY; Williams, PJ; Hooten, MB; Powell, JA; Womble, JN; Bower, MR",2020,Article,Environmetrics,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,modelling,NA
44,Unsteady Multi-Element Time Series Analysis and Prediction Based on Spatial-Temporal Attention and Error Forecast Fusion,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) often cause great harm to fishery production and the safety of human lives. Therefore, the detection and prediction of HABs has become an important issue. Machine learning has been increasingly used to predict HABs at home and abroad. However, few of them can capture the sudden change of Chl-a in advance and handle the long-term dependencies appropriately. In order to address these challenges, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based spatial-temporal attentions model for Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration prediction is proposed, a model which can capture the correlation between various factors and Chl-a adaptively and catch dynamic temporal information from previous time intervals for making predictions. The model can also capture the stage of Chl-a when values soar as red tide breaks out in advance. Due to the instability of the current Chl-a concentration prediction model, the model is also applied to make a prediction about the forecast reliability, to have a basic understanding of the range and fluctuation of model errors and provide a reference to describe the range of marine disasters. The data used in the experiment is retrieved from Fujian Marine Forecasts Station from 2009 to 2011 and is combined into 8-dimension data. Results show that the proposed approach performs better than other Chl-a prediction algorithms (such as Attention LSTM and Seq2seq and back propagation). The result of error prediction also reveals that the error forecast method possesses established advantages for red tides prevention and control.",https://doi.org/10.3390/fi12020034,"Wang, XF; Xu, LY",2020,Article,Future Internet,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,not a forecast,NA
82,Reducing uncertainty in species management: forecasting secondary spread with expert opinion and mechanistic models,"Predicting the spatial and temporal dynamics of invasive species is critical for successful management intervention, yet substantial uncertainty exists about how species will interact with human pathways when introduced to new ecosystems. We demonstrate a novel approach for quantifying uncertainty when predicting the uptake, movement, and establishment of invasive species by combining mechanistic modeling of the spread process with expert opinion of the demographic factors that govern species performance. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using a case study involving the transfer potential of nonindigenous species (NIS) in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin (GLB). A survey using structured expert judgment was completed by 24 North American taxonomic experts, covering 60 species of NIS established in the GLB. Experts estimated species-specific demographic parameters describing population growth and establishment potential, which were incorporated into an existing mechanistic model of human-mediated spread via ballast water with species-specific spread rates (number of ports or lakes invaded/year) as outputs. Expert judgments within each group varied widely, indicating that generalizable rates of spread across taxa are unlikely and highlighting the value of cross-taxon comparisons. Most species were predicted to establish throughout the GLB within 10 yr, assuming status quo management conditions. Sensitivity analysis for expert performance-based weighting demonstrated that most model outputs were insensitive to weighting (<1% difference over baseline) and shows the robustness of the joint model. Overall, the joint expert opinion and predictive modeling method demonstrates a novel means of handling sparse data when forecasting invasion dynamics. Divergent estimates resulted in a range of likely spread rates, but improved upon traditional best-guess approaches. Incorporating joint methods into ecological decision-making frameworks has clear implications for invasive species management but may also inform other ecological scenarios where data are scarce and conservation action is urgent.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3011,"Chenery, ES; Drake, DAR; Mandrak, NE",2020,Article,Ecosphere,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,"interesting.

It is urgent to curb the cyanobacteria bloom and early warn their outbreak. This paper proposes a nonlinear mathematical model of cyanobacteria growth based on stoichiometric analysis. Parameters in the cyanobacteria growth nonlinear mathematical model are estimated and optimized by the cuckoo search intelligent algorithm to improve the estimation accuracy. Time of cyanobacteria blooms outbreak is forecasted by bifurcation sets of the nonlinear mathematical model based on cusp catastrophe theory. Certain natural lake monitoring data is processed with the proposed method for illustration. The results show that time of cyanobacteria blooms outbreak is forecasted accurately by the bifurcation sets of the nonlinear model. Hence, cyanobacteria blooms outbreak can be early warned effectively by the proposed method.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10910-019-01052-x,"Wang, L; Kang, JP; Xu, JP; Zhang, HY; Wang, XY; Yu, JB; Sun, Q; Zao, ZY",2020,Article,J.

266,Projecting Flood-Inducing Precipitation with a Bayesian Analogue Model,"The hazard of pluvial flooding is largely influenced by the spatial and temporal dependence characteristics of precipitation. When extreme precipitation possesses strong spatial dependence, the risk of flooding is amplified due to catchment factors such as topography that cause runoff accumulation. Temporal dependence can also increase flood risk as storm water drainage systems operating at capacity can be overwhelmed by heavy precipitation occurring over multiple days. While transformed Gaussian processes are common choices for modeling precipitation, their weak tail dependence may lead to underestimation of flood risk. Extreme value models such as the generalized Pareto processes for threshold exceedances and max-stable models are attractive alternatives, but are difficult to fit when the number of observation sites is large, and are of little use for modeling the bulk of the distribution, which may also be of interest to water management planners. While the atmospheric dynamics governing precipitation are complex and difficult to fully incorporate into a parsimonious statistical model, non-mechanistic analogue methods that approximate those dynamics have proven to be promising approaches to capturing the temporal dependence of precipitation. In this paper, we present a Bayesian analogue method that leverages large, synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns to make precipitation forecasts. Changing spatial dependence across varying intensities is modeled as a mixture of spatial Student-t processes that can accommodate both strong and weak tail dependence. The proposed model demonstrates improved performance at capturing the distribution of extreme precipitation over Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) 5.2 forecasts.

189,Improving expert forecasts in reliability: Application and evidence for structured elicitation protocols,"Quantitative expert judgements are used in reliability assessments to inform critically important decisions. Structured elicitation protocols have been advocated to improve expert judgements, yet their application in reliability is challenged by a lack of examples or evidence that they improve judgements. This paper aims to overcome these barriers. We present a case study where two world-leading protocols, the IDEA protocol and the Classical Model, were combined and applied by the Australian Department of Defence for a reliability assessment. We assess the practicality of the methods and the extent to which they improve judgements. The average expert was extremely overconfident, with 90% credible intervals containing the true realisation 36% of the time. However, steps contained in the protocols substantially improved judgements. In particular, an equal weighted aggregation of individual judgements and the inclusion of a discussion phase and revised estimate helped to improve calibration, statistical accuracy, and the Classical Model score. Further improvements in precision and information were made via performance weighted aggregation. This paper provides useful insights into the application of structured elicitation protocols for reliability and the extent to which judgements are improved. The findings raise concerns about existing practices for utilising experts in reliability assessments and suggest greater adoption of structured protocols is warranted.

434,ACCURACY OF AIR TEMPERATURE FORECASTS AND ITS USE FOR PREDICTION OF THE REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,"The objective of this study was to verify the quality of the short-term forecasts made by some web sites, as well as the potential of its use in estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo). For the period 2012-2013, every 4-days, the maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) air temperature forecasts for horizons of 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours provided by public sites for Uberlandia-MG were collected and used for calculating the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) calibrated equation. The sites www.accuweather.com (WEATHER); www.cemig.com.br (CEMIG); jornaldotempo.uol.com.br ; (JORNAL) and www.climatempo.com.br (CLIMA) were evaluated. For the same period, the meteorological data were taken at the National Institute of Meteorology (www.inmet.gov.br ). The performance of the Tmax and Tmin forecasts as well as the ETo estimates were made by regression analysis, the mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and t-test. For all sites, there was a better performance in the prediction of Tmin when compared to Tmax, especially by a reduction in errors (MBE and RMSE) and an increase in coefficients b and R 2 . For ETo, the site CLIMA had lowest MBE and RMSE (0.9 mm d(-1)) following by the WEATHER and JORNAL. On the other hand, the site CEMIG presented higher values for MBE (-1.3 mm d(-1)) and RMSE (1.6 mm d(-1)). There was no worsening with an increase of the forecast horizon in these indices, except for R-2 values. The site CLIMA was the only one that did not differ significantly from the ETo values observed.

109,"Seasonal-to-interannual prediction of North American coastal marine ecosystems: Forecast methods, mechanisms of predictability, and priority developments","Marine ecosystem forecasting is an area of active research and rapid development. Promise has been shown for skillful prediction of physical, biogeochemical, and ecological variables on a range of timescales, suggesting potential for forecasts to aid in the management of living marine resources and coastal communities. However, the mechanisms underlying forecast skill in marine ecosystems are often poorly understood, and many forecasts, especially for biological variables, rely on empirical statistical relationships developed from historical observations. Here, we review statistical and dynamical marine ecosystem forecasting methods and highlight examples of their application along U.S. coastlines for seasonal-to-interannual (1-24 month) prediction of properties ranging from coastal sea level to marine top predator distributions. We then describe known mechanisms governing marine ecosystem predictability and how they have been used in forecasts to date. These mechanisms include physical atmospheric and oceanic processes, biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing, and intrinsic characteristics of species themselves. In reviewing the state of the knowledge on forecasting techniques and mechanisms underlying marine ecosystem predictability, we aim to facilitate forecast development and uptake by (i) identifying methods and processes that can be exploited for development of skillful regional forecasts, (ii) informing priorities for forecast development and verification, and (iii) improving understanding of conditional forecast skill (i.e., a priori knowledge of whether a forecast is likely to be skillful).

21,Exponentially Increasing Trend of Infected Patients with COVID-19 in Iran: A Comparison of Neural Network and ARIMA Forecasting Models,"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading around the world and became a pandemic disease. For help to better planning of interventions, this study was conducted to forecast the number of daily new infected cases with COVID-19 for next thirty days in Iran. Methods: The information of observed Iranian new cases from 19th Feb to 30th Mar 2020 was used to predict the number of patients until 29th Apr. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were applied for prediction. The data was prepared from daily reports of Iran Ministry of Health and open datasets provided by the JOHN Hopkins. To compare models, dataset was separated into train and test sets. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was the comparison criteria. Results: Both algorithms forecasted an exponential increase in number of newly infected patients. If the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 7872 and 9558 by 29th Apr, respectively by ANN and ARIMA.

136,Climatic and management determinants of large herbivore production in semiarid grassland,"Knowledge of climatic and management influences on large herbivore production (LHP, kg ha(-1)) is needed for low productivity, semiarid grasslands to address potential consequences of both increasing climate variability and the need to increase animal protein for human consumption. Here, we evaluate the influence of climatic variability and herbivore density on LHP in semiarid grassland using a unique long-term (80 years: 1939-2018) grazing study with three grazing intensities based on forage utilization (light, moderate and heavy). Seasonal variation in precipitation, but not temperature, was the primary influence on LHP. Winter (October-March) and spring (April-June), but not summer (July-September), precipitation during the current year positively influenced LHP across the 3 grazing intensities, whereas prior growing season (prior April-September) precipitation was consistently a negative influence. Although spring precipitation was the most influential seasonal weather variable for LHP, the effect of winter precipitation closely followed under all three grazing intensities, suggesting that non-growing season precipitation is essential for soil water storage to initiate production of sufficient high-quality forage in the subsequent grazing season, resulting in a positive feedback on LHP. A key finding from our analysis was that the effect of summer precipitation is smaller than the combined effects of winter and spring precipitation. As such, much of the variation in LHP can be predicted by seasonal weather parameters that are known early in the growing season. The magnitude of seasonal precipitation effects on LHP was greatest for heavy grazing; consequently LHP with heavy grazing is more reliant on primary production produced in the current year to increase LHP as forage quantity is more limiting than forage quality. Moreover, stability of LHP across years (range: 7.5 to 34.6 kg ha(-1)) was less with heavy grazing, which results in ""boom-bust"" economics that threaten sustainability of operations. Management adaptations to mitigate climatic variability, therefore, will be most necessary and advantageous when land managers employ heavy grazing intensities. Despite the substantial interannual variability in precipitation that characterizes semiarid grasslands, our results show that proactive flexibility by land managers in adjusting grazing management decisions to seasonal precipitation amounts forecasted for the winter and spring seasons would reduce enterprise risk and improve confidence in decision-making, profitability, production efficiency and environmental sustainability from semiarid grasslands.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.106761,"Derner, JD; Raynor, EJ; Reeves, JL; Augustine, DJ; Milchunas, DG",2020,Article,Agric.

8,Modeling harmful algal blooms in a changing climate,"This review assesses harmful algal bloom (HAB) modeling in the context of climate change, examining modeling methodologies that are currently being used, approaches for representing climate processes, and time scales of HAB model projections. Statistical models are most commonly used for near-term HAB forecasting and resource management, but statistical models are not well suited for longer-term projections as forcing conditions diverge from past observations. Process-based models are more complex, difficult to parameterize, and require extensive calibration, but can mechanistically project HAB response under changing forcing conditions. Nevertheless, process-based models remain prone to failure if key processes emerge with climate change that were not identified in model development based on historical observations. We review recent studies on modeling HABs and their response to climate change, and the various statistical and process-based approaches used to link global climate model projections and potential HAB response. We also make several recommendations for how the field can move forward: 1) use process-based models to explicitly represent key physical and biological factors in HAB development, including evaluating HAB response to climate change in the context of the broader ecosystem; 2) quantify and convey model uncertainty using ensemble approaches and scenario planning; 3) use robust approaches to downscale global climate model results to the coastal regions that are most impacted by HABs; and 4) evaluate HAB models with long-term observations, which are critical for assessing long-term trends associated with climate change and far too limited in extent.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2019.101729,"Ralston, DK; Moore, SK",2020,Article,Harmful Algae,English,abby lewis,review,0,1,0,NA,,,NA
172,Turbulence regulation of Microcystis surface scum formation and dispersion during a cyanobacteria bloom event,"Microcystis blooms are a global problem adversely affecting the quality of freshwater in lakes and reservoirs. Surface scum (0-1 m) forms as a result of vertical migration by buoyant Microcystis colonies. Accurate forecasting of bloom and scum development is essential for establishing a reliable alert system and requires understanding the role that physicobiological factors play in the vertical distribution of Microcystis in natural ecosystems. We researched the role of limnological processes on the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies in Lake Kinneret (max depth = 38 m) during a winter-spring bloom. We used measurements from a Laser In situ Scattering and Transmissometry profiler and a plankton image analyser, FlowCAM. Various hydrometeorological conditions were captured during 6 outings from 9 February to 21 March 2017. Thermal stratification and turbulence levels influenced the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies and scum formation. During periods of weak turbulence (e.g., vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity [K-z] <1 cm(2) s(-1)), the volume concentration of Microcystis colonies near the surface abruptly increased. High turbulence levels (e.g., windy conditions) dispersed colonies concentrated near the surface. Simulations of the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies under different turbulence levels showed that the thickness of the surface scum layer increased and colony concentration of scum decreased as turbulence level increased. We demonstrated that K-z >3 cm(2) s(-1), driven by the wind and surface heating/cooling, dispersed the surface layer of concentrated Microcystis colonies. Our results revealed an underlying interdependency between environmental factors and Microcystis colony distribution that can be utilized to accurately forecast scum formation.",https://doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1637681,"Hozumi, A; Ostrovsky, I; Sukenik, A; Gildor, H",2020,Article,Inland Waters,English,mary lofton,NA,NA,1,0,NA,,,NA
158,Incorporation of pollen data in source maps is vital for pollen dispersion models,"Information about distribution of pollen sources, i.e. their presence and abundance in a specific region, is important, especially when atmospheric transport models are applied to forecast pollen concentrations. The goal of this study is to evaluate three pollen source maps using an atmospheric transport model and study the effect on the model results by combining these source maps with pollen data. Here we evaluate three maps for the birch taxon: (1) a map derived by combining a land cover data and forest inventory, (2) a map obtained from land cover data and calibrated using model simulations and pollen observations, and (3) a statistical map resulting from analysis of forest inventory and forest plot data. The maps were introduced to the Enviro-HIRLAM (Environment - High Resolution Limited Area Model) as input data to simulate birch pollen concentrations over Europe for the birch pollen season 2006. A total of 18 model runs were performed using each of the selected maps in turn with and without calibration with observed pollen data from 2006. The model results were compared with the pollen observation data at 12 measurement sites located in Finland, Denmark, and Russia. We show that calibration of the maps using pollen observations significantly improved the model performance for all three maps. The findings also indicate the large sensitivity of the model results to the source maps and agree well with other studies on birch showing that pollen or hybrid-based source maps provide the best model performance. This study highlights the importance of including pollen data in the production of source maps for pollen dispersion modelling and for exposure studies.",https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2099-2020,"Kurganskiy, A; Skjoth, CA; Baklanov, A; Sofiev, M; Saarto, A; Severova, E; Smyshlyaev, S; Kaas, E",2020,Article,Atmos.

39,A potential threat to amphibians in the European Natura 2000 network: Forecasting the distribution of the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus,"Freshwater biodiversity is declining at an accelerated pace. Climate change and associated global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, combined with the expansion of generalist -invasive species are two of the main threats. Niche-based models (NBMs) are becoming inevitable tools in invasive species risk assessment and in conservation decision-making. Lithobates catesbeianus is an invasive species globally known for its adverse ecological impacts on native amphibians and biodiversity. To assess species current and future climatic suitable areas at the global and European scales we used an ensemble forecasting approach. We considered six climatic variables, three timeframes (current, 2050, and 2070), and two CO2 emission scenarios. Temperature seasonality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and precipitation in the driest month were the most important variables predicting bullfrog occurrence. Globally currently 3.8% of land area is suitable for bullfrog and an increase of up to 5.2% in 2070 is expected. Increase in suitable areas is expected at higher latitudes, especially in North America and central Europe. Currently, 3.45% of total Natura 2000 area is suitable, and a predicted range gain of up to 355.93% (12.28%) is expected in the highest concentration scenarios predictions. This can indicate that the 64 native amphibian species present in the Natura 2000 network could be at increased risk. The choice of Natura 2000 for a geographic detailed analysis of the possible effects on native amphibians is due to its importance for habitats and wildlife conservation.

241,"Spatial pattern and determinants of global invasion risk of an invasive species, sharpbelly Hemiculter leucisculus (Basilesky, 1855)","Invasive species have imposed huge negative impacts on worldwide aquatic ecosystems and are generally difficult or impossible to be eradicated once established. Consequently, it becomes particularly important to ascertain their invasion risk and its determinants since such information can help us formulate more effective preventive or management actions and direct these measures to those areas where they are truly needed so as to ease regulatory burdens. Here, we examined the global invasion risk and its determinants of sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus), one freshwater fish which has a high invasive potential, by using species distribution models (SDMs) and a layer overlay method. Specifically, first an ensemble species distribution model and its basal models (developed from seven machine learning algorithms) were explored to forecast the global habitat-suitability and variables importance for this species, and then a global invasion risk map was created by combining habitat-suitability with a proxy for introduction likelihood (entailing propagule pressure and dispersal constraints) of exotic sharpbelly. The results revealed that (1) the ensemble model had the highest predictive power in forecasting sharpbelly's global habitat-suitability; (2) areas with high invasion risk by sharpbelly patchily spread over the world except Antarctica; and (3) the Human Influence Index (HII), rather than any of the bioclimatic variables, was the most important factor influencing sharpbelly' future invasion. Based on these results, the present study also attempted to propose a series of prevention and management strategies to eliminate or alleviate the adverse effects caused by this species' further expansion.

The assessment of the current early warning and crop forecasting system which was designed in mid 80's identified a number of deficiencies that have serious impact on the timeliness and reliability of the data. We developed a new method to forecast maize yield across smallholder farmers' fields in Tanzania (Morogoro, Kagera and Tanga districts) by integrating field-based survey with a process-based mechanistic crop simulation model. The method has shown to provide acceptable forecasts (r(2) values of 0.94, 0.88 and 0.5 in Tanga, Morogoro and Kagera districts, respectively) 14-77 days prior to crop harvest across the three districts, in spite of wide range of maize growing conditions (final yields ranged from 0.2-5.9 t/ha). This study highlights the possibility of achieving accurate yield forecasts, and scaling up to regional levels for smallholder farming systems, where uncertainties in management conditions and field size are large.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01020-3,"Liu, L; Basso, B",2020,Article; Early Access,Food Secur.,English,mary lofton,NA,1,1,1,NA,abby lewis,yep,NA
