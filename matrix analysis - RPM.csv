"Comment","forecasting is not the primary focus of the paper, but there is one section where they do forecast P concentrations ~ 8 yrs into the future","My best guess is that it is <10yr based on the model descriptions but this will definitely be a paper we review further.

"SecondComment","Agree with Nick's comment!","5 day forecasts","yes; hard to tell if they're using forecasted drivers, little detail on forecasting methods","yes forecast","Yes, but this is going to be rough...","yep","is a forecast!","yes; hindcasting algal blooms","yes. Hindcasts, nowcasts, and 3 day forecasts","yes; I *think* they were using hindcasted drivers for at least part of the dataset although the way they describe divvying up their training/testing/forecasting period is pretty tough to follow","yes; forecasting sea otters 5 years out","yes; annual forecasts of hornet nest location","yes ","is a forecast! but is a meta-analysis of multiple forecast studies, addressing model complexity and predictability. could be used to assess multiple studies","yep!"
