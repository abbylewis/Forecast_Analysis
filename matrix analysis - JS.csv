"Comment","After a quick skim of the article it looks like this is hindcasting of herring from the 1930's","","","","","","","","i don't think that number of fish caught is necessarily biogeochemical or organismal, but its related to population","","","","validated on near-term, out of sample data","Does fire count as biogeochemical?","",""
"SecondComment","ok, this is a hard one. While they are technically producing a forecast using data from the past, it is from the 1930s and so a lot of the questions we would be interested in for the matrix do not apply (e.g. cyberinfrastructure, uncertainty, even forecast assessment metricx). I don't think this one should be included personally. Abby: I am going to include it for now because it seems to meet our criteria","is a forecast!","yes forecast (hindcast)","yes; 7-day forecasts of mosquitoes","yes; Spatial and temporal ","yes; 5-day-ahead forecasts of cyanobacteria","sort of? It does a regression using previous months. Not our typical image of a forecast, but I think it counts as a hindcast","simulation","seems good!","yes; hindcasts/simulations using forecasted met as drivers","yep","yes forecast","yes forecast","yes it does","yep!","forecast for two projected scenarios (2015 and 2027) - could be both near-term and long-term"
