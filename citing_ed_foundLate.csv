For 12 locations in Michigan, variables derived from extended forecast data (MEX) from the National Weather Service model output statistics (MOS) were compared with those similarly derived from Unedited Local Climatological Data (ULCD) for the growing seasons 2001-2004. The most effective model for late blight risk prediction based on comparison with risk estimated with ULCD was a resilient propagation (Rprop) neural network model with 49 variables and 10 hidden nodes. The neural network model had significantly higher overall accuracy than the other models, and was particularly successful at predicting risk values in June, July, and August when knowledge of potato late blight risk is most critical to growers making management decisions with regard to fungicide sprays and irrigation scheduling. The neural network model was also significantly more accurate than the regional average of days with no late blight risk (0.72%). For each of the four models, monthly accuracy at any single station was negatively correlated with the percentage of days per month classified as risk days for potato late blight (P = 0.01). Although no validation with disease data was conducted, such models are still useful in the context of advising growers of forecast conditions that may be favorable for late blight according to model values, such as Wallin style disease severity values, with which they are familiar.

J,"Clark, MP; Hay, LE",,,,"Clark, MP; Hay, LE",,,Use of medium-range numerical weather prediction model output to produce forecasts of streamflow,JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NCEP-NCAR; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; REANALYSES; TEMPERATURE; VALIDATION; SYSTEM; ERROR,"This paper examines an archive containing over 40 years of 8-day atmospheric forecasts over the contiguous United States from the NCEP reanalysis project to assess the possibilities for using medium-range numerical weather prediction model output for predictions of streamflow. This analysis shows the biases in the NCEP forecasts to be quite extreme. In many regions, systematic precipitation biases exceed 100% of the mean, with temperature biases exceeding 3degreesC. In some locations, biases are even higher. The accuracy of NCEP precipitation and 2-m maximum temperature forecasts is computed by interpolating the NCEP model output for each forecast day to the location of each station in the NWS cooperative network and computing the correlation with station observations. Results show that the accuracy of the NCEP forecasts is rather low in many areas of the country. Most apparent is the generally low skill in precipitation forecasts (particularly in July) and low skill in temperature forecasts in the western United States, the eastern seaboard, and the southern tier of states. These results outline a clear need for additional processing of the NCEP Medium-Range Forecast Model (MRF) output before it is used for hydrologic predictions. Techniques of model output statistics (MOS) are used in this paper to downscale the NCEP forecasts to station locations. Forecasted atmospheric variables (e.g., total column precipitable water, 2-m air temperature) are used as predictors in a forward screening multiple linear regression model to improve forecasts of precipitation and temperature for stations in the National Weather Service cooperative network. This procedure effectively removes all systematic biases in the raw NCEP precipitation and temperature forecasts. MOS guidance also results in substantial improvements in the accuracy of maximum and minimum temperature forecasts throughout the country. For precipitation, forecast improvements were less impressive. MOS guidance increases the accuracy of precipitation forecasts over the northeastern United States, but overall, the accuracy of MOS-based precipitation forecasts is slightly lower than the raw NCEP forecasts. Four basins in the United States were chosen as case studies to evaluate the value of MRF output for predictions of streamflow. Streamflow forecasts using MRF output were generated for one rainfall-dominated basin (Alapaha River at Statenville, Georgia) and three snowmelt-dominated basins (Animas River at Durango, Colorado; East Fork of the Carson River near Gardnerville, Nevada; and Cle Elum River near Roslyn, Washington). Hydrologic model output forced with measured-station data were used as truth'' to focus attention on the hydrologic effects of errors in the MRF forecasts. Eight-day streamflow forecasts produced using the MOS-corrected MRF output as input (MOS) were compared with those produced using the climatic Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique. MOS-based streamflow forecasts showed increased skill in the snowmelt-dominated river basins, where daily variations in streamflow are strongly forced by temperature. In contrast, the skill of MOS forecasts in the rainfall-dominated basin (the Alapaha River) were equivalent to the skill of the ESP forecasts. Further improvements in streamflow forecasts require more accurate local-scale forecasts of precipitation and temperature, more accurate specification of basin initial conditions, and more accurate model simulations of streamflow.","Univ Colorado, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; US Geol Survey, Denver, CO 80225 USA","Clark, MP (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Ctr Sci & Technol Policy Res, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, 1333 Grandview Ave,UCB 488, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",clark@vorticity.colorado.edu,"Clark, Martyn/A-5560-2015; Clark, Martyn/AAH-9999-2020","Clark, Martyn/0000-0002-2186-2625; Clark, Martyn/0000-0002-2186-2625",,,,34,106,106,0,19,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

Fungicide applications, fungicide weathering, and pathogen development were simulated with a system of field-tested computer simulation models, using 50 yr of weather data from Steuben County, New York. Weather forecasts were simulated with a probability model that relates distributions of observed high relative humidity periods and mean temperature to forecasts produced by the National Meteorological Center. Simulated weather forecasts (with accuracy equivalent to those of real forecasts) improved the efficiency in the use of fungicide scheduled with BLITECAST: The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was decreased by about 5%, but the same number of fungicide sprays was used. The maximum contribution of a weather forecast was determined by using perfect knowledge of future weather 1 and 2 days in advance as the weather forecast. Such perfect knowledge of future weather used with BLITECAST or with a simulation-based disease forecast decreased AUDPC by about 8 or 10%, respectively. Finally, two additional sets of simulations were done with weather data modified to be less favorable to late blight. In these simulations, weather forecasts provided an increasing benefit as conditions for late blight development became less favorable.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT SOIL CROP & ATMOSPHER SCI,ITHACA,NY 14853","RAPOSO, R (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,DEPT PLANT PATHOL,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",,"Raposo, Rosa/A-3185-2012","Raposo, Rosa/0000-0002-4893-6874",,,,32,30,33,0,9,AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC,ST PAUL,"3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121",0031-949X,,,PHYTOPATHOLOGY,Phytopathology,JAN,1993,83,1,,,,,103,108,,10.1094/Phyto-83-103,,,6,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,KK483,WOS:A1993KK48300012,,,,,2020-08-10,

Performance of forecasts of this quantity, based on the model output statistics 3-h temperature and dewpoint forecasts produced by the National Meteorological Center, is examined for selected locations. A probability model for high relative humidity duration conditional on these forecasts is presented, which succinctly describes forecast performance and would be straightforward to implement operationally.
