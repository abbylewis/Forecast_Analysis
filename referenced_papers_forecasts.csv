Yet their interaction is largely unresolved. Using a single-species population model along a one-dimensional environmental gradient, we show how local competition and dispersal jointly shape the eco-evolutionary dynamics and speed of invasion. From a focal introduction site, the generic pattern predicted by our model features a temporal transition from wave-like to pulsed invasion. Each regime is driven primarily by local adaptation, while the transition is caused by eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by dispersal. The interaction range and cost of dispersal arise as key factors of the duration and speed of each phase. Our results demonstrate that spatial eco-evolutionary feedbacks along environmental gradients can drive strong temporal variation in the rate and structure of population spread, and must be considered to better understand and forecast invasion rates and range dynamics.",,,,,"Andrade-Restrepo, Martin/0000-0002-0371-5541",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform. Iterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modelling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts. The forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models. Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise ranging from field site experience to software development. Automated near-term iterative forecasting systems will allow the science of ecological forecasting to advance more rapidly and provide the most up-to-date forecasts possible for conservation and management. These forecasting systems will also accelerate basic science by allowing new models of natural systems to be quickly implemented and compared to existing models. Using existing technology, and teams with diverse skill sets, it is possible for ecologists to build automated forecasting systems and use them to advance our understanding of natural systems.",,,,"Christensen, Erica/AAK-7533-2020; Simonis, Juniper/AAE-2410-2019; Bledsoe, Ellen/S-5147-2017","Christensen, Erica/0000-0002-5635-2502; Simonis, Juniper/0000-0001-9798-0460; Taylor, Shawn/0000-0002-6178-6903; Yenni, Glenda/0000-0001-6969-1848; White, Ethan/0000-0001-6728-7745; Bledsoe, Ellen/0000-0002-3629-7235",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Temporal early warning signals such as the variance of a time series, and spatial early warning signals such as the spatial correlation in a snapshot of the system's state, have been proposed to forecast critical transitions. However, temporal early warning signals do not take the spatial pattern into account, and past spatial indicators only examine one snapshot at a time. In this study, we propose the use of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of multiple time series as early warning signals. We first show theoretically why these indicators may increase as the system moves closer to the critical transition. Then, we apply the method to simulated data from several spatial ecological models to demonstrate the method's applicability. This method has the advantage that it takes into account only the fluctuations of the system about its equilibrium, thus eliminating the effects of any change in equilibrium values. The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix is helpful for identifying the regions that are most vulnerable to the critical transition.",,,,"O'Dea, Eamon/E-6389-2016","O'Dea, Eamon/0000-0003-4748-683X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,22-Feb,2019,9,,,,,,,,2572,10.1038/s41598-019-38961-5,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000459399400041,,,,,

This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.",,,,"Orr, Michael/AAF-7232-2019","Orr, Michael/0000-0002-9096-3008; Riemer, Kristina/0000-0003-3802-3331; Meiners, Joan/0000-0001-9369-9313; White, Ethan/0000-0001-6728-7745; Taylor, Shawn/0000-0002-6178-6903",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2019,100,2,,,,,,,UNSP e02568,10.1002/ecy.2568,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000457618800013,,,,,

It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Wuest, Rafael O/G-6070-2012; Schroder, Boris/N-7250-2019; Warton, David/B-5791-2009; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Calabrese, Justin/B-9131-2012; Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Wuest, Rafael O/0000-0001-6047-1945; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Warton, David/0000-0001-9441-6645; Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Calabrese, Justin/0000-0003-0575-6408; Barton, Kamil/0000-0001-5562-8274; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509; Matechou, Eleni/0000-0003-3626-844X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The purpose of M4 was to replicate the results of the previous ones and extend them into three directions: First significantly increase the number of series, second include Machine Learning (ML) forecasting methods, and third evaluate both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were ""combinations"" of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a ""hybrid"" approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method's average sMAPE was close to 10% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naive2.

The input data to compute SI-x were treated with a daily joint bias correction approach, and the SI-x outputs computed from the North American Multimodel Ensemble were postprocessed using an ensemble model output statistic approachnonhomogeneous Gaussian regression. This ensemble model output statistic approach was used to quantify the effects of training period length and ensemble size on forecast skill. The lead time for predicting the timing of spring onset is found to be from 10 to 60 days, with the higher end of this range located along a narrow band between 35 degrees N to 45 degrees N in the eastern United States. Using continuous rank probability scores and skill score (SS) thresholds, this study demonstrates that ranges of positive predictability of SI-x fall into two categories: 10-40 and 40-60 days. Using higher skill thresholds (SS equal to 0.1 and 0.2), predictability is confined to a lower range with values around 10-30 days. The postprocessing work using joint bias correction improves the predictive skill for SI-x relative to the untreated input data set. Using nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression, a positive change in the SS is noted in regions where the skill with joint bias correction shows evidence of improvement. These findings suggest that the start of spring might be predictable on intraseasonal time horizons, which in turn could be useful for farmers, growers, and stakeholders making decisions on these time scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The Outlooks are generated by applying the algorithm used in CRW's operational satellite coral bleaching heat stress monitoring, with slight modifications, to the sea surface temperature (SST) predictions from NCEP's operational Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). Once a week, the probability of heat stress capable of causing mass coral bleaching is predicted for 4-months in advance. Each day, CFSv2 generates an ensemble of 16 forecasts, with nine runs out to 45-days, three runs out to 3-months, and four runs out to 9-months. This results in 28-112 ensemble members produced each week. A composite for each predicted week is derived from daily predictions within each ensemble member. The probability of each of four heat stress ranges (Watch and higher, Warning and higher, Alert Level 1 and higher, and Alert Level 2) is determined from all the available ensemble members for the week to form the weekly probabilistic Outlook. The probabilistic 4-Month Outlook is the highest weekly probability predicted among all the weekly Outlooks during a 4-month period for each of the stress ranges. An initial qualitative skill analysis of the Outlooks for 2011-2015, compared with CRW's satellite-based coral bleaching heat stress products, indicated the Outlook has performed well with high hit rates and low miss rates for most coral reef areas. Regions identified with high false alarm rates will guide future improvements. This Outlook system, as the first and only freely available global coral bleaching prediction system, has been providing critical early warning to marine resource managers, scientists, and decision makers around the world to guide management, protection, and monitoring of coral reefs since 2012. This has been especially valuable during the third global coral bleaching event that started in mid-2014 and extended into mid-2017.

Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.",,,,"Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; Randerson, James/Y-2550-2019; Kenney, Melissa/H-6426-2014; Laney, Christine/B-7867-2010","Vargas, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6829-5333; Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Kenney, Melissa/0000-0002-2121-8135; Laney, Christine/0000-0002-4944-2083",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

While the number of forecasts for biodiversity is increasing, there is little information available on how well these forecasts work. Most biodiversity forecasts are not evaluated to determine how well they predict future diversity, fail to account for uncertainty, and do not use time-series data that captures the actual dynamics being studied. We addressed these limitations by using best practices to explore our ability to forecast the species richness of breeding birds in North America. We used hindcasting to evaluate six different modeling approaches for predicting richness. Hindcasts for each method were evaluated annually for a decade at 1,237 sites distributed throughout the continental United States. All models explained more than 50% of the variance in richness, but none of them consistently outperformed a baseline model that predicted constant richness at each site. The best practices implemented in this study directly influenced the forecasts and evaluations. Stacked species distribution models and ""naive"" forecasts produced poor estimates of uncertainty and accounting for this resulted in these models dropping in the relative performance compared to other models. Accounting for observer effects improved model performance overall, but also changed the rank ordering of models because it did not improve the accuracy of the ""naive"" model. Considering the forecast horizon revealed that the prediction accuracy decreased across all models as the time. horizon of the forecast increased. To facilitate the rapid improvement of biodiversity forecasts, we emphasize the value of specific best practices in making forecasts and evaluating forecasting methods.",,,,,"Taylor, Shawn/0000-0002-6178-6903",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,8-Feb,2018,6,,,,,,,,e4278,10.7717/peerj.4278,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000424498400001,,,,,

So far, mountain areas have mostly been spared from large-scale invasions. However, climate change, land-use abandonment, the development of tourism and the increasing ornamental trade will weaken the barriers to invasions in these systems. Understanding how alien species will react and how native communities will influence their success is thus of prime importance in a management perspective. Here, we used a spatially and temporally explicit simulation model to forecast invasion risks in a protected mountain area in the French Alps under future conditions. We combined scenarios of climate change, land-use abandonment and tourism-linked increases in propagule pressure to test if the spread of alien species in the region will increase in the future. We modelled already naturalized alien species and new ornamental plants, accounting for interactions among global change components, and also competition with the native vegetation. Our results show that propagule pressure and climate change will interact to increase overall species richness of both naturalized aliens and new ornamentals, as well as their upper elevational limits and regional range-sizes. Under climate change, woody aliens are predicted to more than double in range-size and herbaceous species to occupy up to 20% of the park area. In contrast, land-use abandonment will open new invasion opportunities for woody aliens, but decrease invasion probability for naturalized and ornamental alien herbs as a consequence of colonization by native trees. This emphasizes the importance of interactions with the native vegetation either for facilitating or potentially for curbing invasions. Overall, our work highlights an additional and previously underestimated threat for the fragile mountain flora of the Alps already facing climate changes, land-use transformations and overexploitation by tourism.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012; Munkemuller, Tamara/AAQ-1670-2020","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887; Dullinger, Iwona/0000-0002-2692-2973; Talluto, Matthew/0000-0001-5188-7332; Boulangeat, Isabelle/0000-0002-8463-7046; Barros, Ceres/0000-0003-4036-977X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The imbalance in the long term mean global averaged energy fluxes are also evaluated. The global averaged imbalance at the surface and at the TOA is found to be 0.37 and 6.43 Wm(-2), respectively. It is shown that CFSv2 overestimates the land surface albedo, particularly over the snow region, which in turn contributes to the cold biases in 2 m air temperature. On the other hand, surface albedo is highly underestimated over the coastal region around Antarctica and that may have contributed to the warm bias over that oceanic region.

If migration fails to keep pace with climate change, as models predict, the most suitable sources for restoration may not occur locally at all. To address this issue, we propose a strategy of prestoration: utilizing species in restoration for which a site represents suitable habitat now and into the future. Using the Colorado Plateau, United States, as a case study, we assess the ability of grass species currently used regionally in restoration to persist into the future using projections of ecological niche models (or climate envelope models) across a suite of climate change scenarios. We then present a technique for identifying new species that best compensate for future losses of suitable habitat by current target species. We found that the current suite of species, selected by a group of experts, is predicted to perform reasonably well in the short term, but that losses of prestorable habitat by mid-century would approach 40%. Using an algorithm to identify additional species, we found that fewer than 10 species could compensate for nearly all of the losses incurred by the current target species.

A detailed analysis of the tropical intraseasonal variability (TISV) and convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEW) in comparison with the original (control) model and with observations is presented here. The last 10 years of a 15-yr-long climate simulation are analyzed. Significant improvements are seen in the simulation of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and most of the CCEWs as well as the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). These improvements appear in the form of improved morphology and physical features of these waves. This can be regarded as a validation of the central idea behind the SMCM according to which organized tropical convection is based on three cloud types, namely, the congestus, deep, and stratiform cloud decks, that interact with each other and form a building block for multiscale convective systems. An adequate accounting of the dynamical interactions of this cloud hierarchy thus constitutes an important requirement for cumulus parameterizations to succeed in representing atmospheric tropical variability. SAS fails to fulfill this requirement, which is evident in the unrealistic physical structures of the major intraseasonal modes simulated by CFSv2 as documented here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

Next, the quantitative application of the framework to partitioning uncertainties is illustrated using a short-term forecast of net ecosystem exchange.

Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.",,,,"Schroder, Boris/B-7211-2009; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013; Schroder, Boris/N-7250-2019; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/F-7461-2015; Warton, David/B-5791-2009; Hauenstein, Severin/AAE-9923-2019; Lahoz-Monfort, Jose/O-3546-2017; Boyce, Mark/A-2620-2014","Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/0000-0002-8387-5739; Warton, David/0000-0001-9441-6645; Hauenstein, Severin/0000-0001-8003-0944; Lahoz-Monfort, Jose/0000-0002-0845-7035; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794; Boyce, Mark/0000-0001-5811-325X; Roberts, David/0000-0002-3437-2422",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2017,40,8,,,,,913,929,,10.1111/ecog.02881,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000406971800002,,,,,

Resolving thisunpredictability represents a major, but critical challenge to the science of restoration ecology. In an effort to move restoration ecology toward a more predictive science, we consider the key issue of variability. Typically, restoration outcomes vary relative to goals (i.e. reference or desired future conditions) and with respect to the outcomes of other restoration efforts. The field of restoration ecology has largely considered only this first type of variation, often focusing on an oversimplified success vs. failure dichotomy. The causes of variation, particularly among restoration efforts, remain poorly understood for most systems. Variation associated with restoration outcomes is a consequence of how, where and when restoration is conducted; variation is also influenced by how the outcome of restoration is measured. We propose that variation should decrease with the number of factors constraining restoration and increase with the specificity of the goal. When factors (e.g. harsh environmental conditions, limited species reintroductions) preclude most species, little variation will exist among restorations, particularly when goals are associated with metrics such as physical structure, where species may be broadly interchangeable. Conversely, when few constraints to species membership exist, substantial variation may result and this will be most pronounced when restoration is assessed by metrics such as taxonomic composition.

Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling provides a framework to make statistical inference and probabilistic forecasts, using mechanistic ecological models. To illustrate, we show how hierarchical Bayesian models of ecological diffusion can be implemented for large data sets that are distributed densely across space and time. The hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to understand and forecast the growth and geographic spread in the prevalence of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We compare statistical inference and forecasts from our hierarchical Bayesian model to phenomenological regression-based methods that are commonly used to analyse spatial occurrence data.

We predominantly used data from the eBird citizen-science project to model probabilities of occurrence relative to land-use patterns, spatial distribution of wetlands, and climate. We projected models to potential future climate conditions using five representative general circulation models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). We used Random Forests to model probabilities of occurrence and compared the time periods 1981-2010 (hindcast) and 2041-2070 (forecast) in ""model space."" Projected changes in shorebird probabilities of occurrence varied with species-specific general distribution pattern, migration distance, and spatial extent. Species using the western and northern portion of the study area exhibited the greatest likelihoods of decline, whereas species with more easterly occurrences, mostly long-distance migrants, had the greatest projected increases in probability of occurrence. At an ecoregional extent, differences in probabilities of shorebird occurrence ranged from -0.015 to 0.045 when averaged across climate models, with the largest increases occurring early in migration. Spatial shifts are predicted for several shorebird species. Probabilities of occurrence of wintering Mallards and Northern Pintail are predicted to increase by 0.046 and 0.061, respectively, with northward shifts projected for both species. When incorporated into partner land management decision tools, results at ecoregional extents can be used to identify wetland complexes with the greatest potential to support birds in the nonbreeding season under a wide range of future climate scenarios.",,,,,"Skagen, Susan/0000-0002-6744-1244",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Use of the term 'big data' implies an approach that includes capacity to aggregate, search, cross-reference, and mine large volumes of data to generate new understanding that can inform decision-making about emergent properties of complex systems. Although big-data approaches are not a panacea, there are large-scale environmental questions for which big data are well suited, even necessary. Ecosystems are complex biophysical systems that are not easily defined by any one data type, location, or time. Understanding complex ecosystem properties is data intensive along axes of volume (size of data), velocity (frequency of data), and variety (diversity of data types). Ecosystem scientists have employed impressive technology for generating high-frequency, large-volume data streams. Yet important challenges remain in both theoretical and infrastructural development to support visualization and analysis of large and diverse data. The way forward includes greater support for network science approaches, and for development of big-data infrastructure that includes capacity for visualization and analysis of integrated data products.

During a marine heat wave in 2012, the fishery was disrupted by the early warming of spring ocean temperatures and subsequent influx of lobster landings. This situation resulted in a price collapse, as the supply chain was not prepared for the early and abundant landings of lobsters. Motivated by this series of events, we have developed a forecast of when the Maine (USA) lobster fishery will shift into its high volume summer landings period. The forecast uses a regression approach to relate spring ocean temperatures derived from four NERACOOS buoys along the coast of Maine to the start day of the high landings period of the fishery. Tested against conditions in past years, the forecast is able to predict the start day to within 1 week of the actual start, and the forecast can be issued 3-4 months prior to the onset of the high landings period, providing valuable lead-time for the fishery and its associated supply chain to prepare for the upcoming season. Forecast results are conveyed in a probabilistic manner and are updated weekly over a 6-week forecasting period so that users can assess the certainty and consistency of the forecast and factor the uncertainty into their use of the information in a given year. By focusing on the timing of events, this type of seasonal forecast provides climate-relevant information to users at time scales that are meaningful for operational decisions. As climate change alters seasonal phenology and reduces the reliability of past experience as a guide for future expectations, this type of forecast can enable fishing industry participants to better adjust to and prepare for operating in the context of climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Skilful forecasts ranging from seasonal (3 months) to decadal (5-10 years) time scales are now a reality. With the advance of these forecasts of ocean physics, the first generation of marine ecological forecasts has started to emerge. Such forecasts are potentially of great value in the management of living marine resources and for all of those who are dependent on the ocean for both nutrition and their livelihood; however, this is still a field in its infancy. We review the state of the art in this emerging field and identify the lessons that can be learnt and carried forward from these pioneering efforts. The majority of this first wave of products are forecasts of spatial distributions, possibly reflecting the inherent suitability of this response variable to the task of forecasting. Promising developments are also seen in forecasting fish-stock recruitment where, despite well-recognized challenges in understanding and predicting this response, new process knowledge and model approaches that could form a basis for forecasting are becoming available. Forecasts of phenology and coral-bleaching events are also being applied to monitoring and industry decisions. Moving marine ecological forecasting forward will require striking a balance between what is feasible and what is useful. We propose here a set of criteria to quickly identify 'low hanging fruit"" that can potentially be predicted; however, ensuring the usefulness of forecast products also requires close collaboration with actively engaged end-users. Realizing the full potential of marine ecological forecasting will require bridging the gaps between marine ecology and climatology on the one-hand, and between science and end-users on the other. Nevertheless, the successes seen thus far and the potential to develop further products suggest that the field of marine ecological forecasting can be expected to flourish in the coming years.",,,,"Tommasi, Desiree/M-1668-2015; Payne, Mark/C-6844-2008; Liu, Gang/E-7921-2011","Tommasi, Desiree/0000-0003-4027-6047; Payne, Mark/0000-0001-5795-2481; Liu, Gang/0000-0001-8369-6805; Miesner, Anna K./0000-0002-2213-4312; MacKenzie, Brian/0000-0002-4798-0363",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Mathematical and statistical models play a critical role in this process by integrating data from multiple sources in a way that is honest about uncertainty. We show the utility of Bayesian hierarchical models for supporting decisions on managing natural resources of national parks. These models can assimilate monitoring data to provide true forecasts, resulting in probabilistic predictions of future states of park ecosystems accompanied by rigorous estimates of uncertainty. We discuss a novel approach for communicating these forecasts to decision makers who need to evaluate the probability that NPS goals will be met given different management actions, including the null model of no action. We illustrate how this approach has been used successfully to inform decisions on the elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population management in Rocky Mountain National Park based on 47 yr of monitoring data. Forecasts from a discrete time, stage-structured population model assimilated with annual census and sex and age classifications are being used annually to help park managers decide on actions needed to meet goals for elk and vegetation. In particular, park managers were able to determine the probability that the elk population would fall within a desired population range, which led to both population reduction actions and no action depending on the year of interest. Moreover, this approach allowed multiple survey methodologies from the last 47 years to be incorporated into a single model with associated estimates of uncertainty. Models like this one are especially useful for adaptive management where continuous improvement in models and data results in long-term improvement in the wisdom of policy and management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,NOV,2016,7,11,,,,,,,e01587,10.1002/ecs2.1587,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000392207600016,,,,,

The CFSv2 is generally capable of reproducing the observed Eurasian SCF seasonal cycle and climatology. This study focuses on the prediction skill and predictability of Eurasian SCF in snowmelt and snowfall seasons because the intensive variability occurs in the two seasons. The CFSv2 reasonably predicts the interannual variations, long-term trend and leading pattern in snowmelt season several months ahead. In comparison with the snowmelt season, the CFSv2 shows a better prediction skill in climatological values but a worse skill in the interannual variability in snowfall season. In addition, the forecasted downward trend of SCF in the snowfall season is opposite to that in the observation. The biases of Eurasian SCF in the snowmelt and snowfall seasons are significantly related with those of temperature and precipitation in the CFSv2. The forecasted cooler and wetter atmosphere is suggestive of the overestimation of the mean SCF. Meanwhile, the underestimation in the variability of both temperature and precipitation in the CFSv2 may be the important factor for the underestimated variability of SCF, especially for the damped variability of SCF in the snowfall season. Generally, the CFSv2 shows a higher and more stable prediction skill after late-1990s than before in the two seasons. The change in the initial condition in the CFSv2 and the observed SCF in late-1990s might be the plausible reason for it.",,,,"He, Qiong/A-4842-2017; Zhang, Renhe/AAA-6301-2020","Zhang, Renhe/0000-0001-7750-8679",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

We overcome this limitation by taking advantage of two recent advances: remotely sensed, species-specific estimates of plant cover and statistical models developed for spatiotemporal dynamics of animal populations. Using computationally efficient model reparameterizations, we fit a spatiotemporal population model to a 28-year time series of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) percent cover over a 2.5 x 5 km landscape in southwestern Wyoming while formally accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We include interannual variation in precipitation and temperature as covariates in the model to investigate how climate affects the cover of sagebrush. We then use the model to forecast the future abundance of sagebrush at the landscape scale under projected climate change, generating spatially explicit estimates of sagebrush population trajectories that have, until now, been impossible to produce at this scale. Our broadscale and long-term predictions are rooted in small-scale and short-term population dynamics and provide an alternative to predictions offered by species distribution models that do not include population dynamics.

The performance of the original and new triggering criteria is first compared against radiosonde observations. Then, a series of hindcasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the triggering criterion in the CFSv2 representation of summer precipitation, the diurnal cycle of precipitation, and hurricanes that made landfall. The observational analysis shows that the HCF trigger better captures the frequency of convection, where the original SAS trigger initiates convection too often. When implemented in CFSv2, the HCF trigger improves the seasonal forecast of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, including the representation of the onset dates of the rainy season over India. On the other hand, the HCF trigger increases error in the seasonal forecast of precipitation over the eastern United States.

Here, we introduce a suite of forecasting methods which improve traditional analog forecasting by combining ideas from kernel methods developed in harmonic analysis and machine learning and state-space reconstruction for dynamical systems. A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog forecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local similarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent features designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate maps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial observations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field generating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel methods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative strategies based on the Nystrom method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids technique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a low-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic metastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of a comprehensive climate model.

Comparisons of limnological parameters of the two phases revealed not only a distinct seasonal extension of N-limitation but also higher water temperatures that rose earlier and lasted longer between spring and autumn from 1997 to 2012. These differences were reflected by threshold conditions and sensitivity functions of the cyanobacteria-specific models evolved by HEA for the two phases. Seven-day-ahead forecasts matched well timings of peaking biomass observed for the three cyanobacteria but partially failed to predict accurate magnitudes, whereby coefficients of determination r (2) ranged between 0.48 and 0.76 for models in Phase I and between 0.42 and 0.69 in Phase II.

Here we present methods to detect when climate predictions are failing to capture the system dynamics. For a single model, we measure goodness of fit based on the empirical distribution function, and define failure when the distribution of observed values significantly diverges from the modelled distribution. For a set of models, the same statistic can be used to provide relative weights for the individual models, and we define failure when there is no linear weighting of the ensemble models that produces a satisfactory match to the observations. Early detection of failure of a set of predictions is important for improving model predictions and the decisions based on them.

Most forecasts of climate change refugia for species are based on correlative species distribution models (SDMs) using long-term climate averages, projected to future climate scenarios. Limitations of such methods include the need to extrapolate into novel environments and uncertainty regarding the extent to which proximate variables included in the model capture processes driving distribution limits (and thus can be assumed to provide reliable predictions under new conditions). These limitations are well documented; however, their impact on the quality of climate refugia predictions is difficult to quantify. Here, we develop a detailed bioenergetics model for the koala. It indicates that range limits are driven by heat-induced water stress, with the timing of rainfall and heat waves limiting the koala in the warmer parts of its range. We compare refugia predictions from the bioenergetics model with predictions from a suite of competing correlative SDMs under a range of future climate scenarios. SDMs were fitted using combinations of long-term climate and weather extremes variables, to test how well each set of predictions captures the knowledge embedded in the bioenergetics model. Correlative models produced broadly similar predictions to the bioenergetics model across much of the species' current range - with SDMs that included weather extremes showing highest congruence. However, predictions in some regions diverged significantly when projecting to future climates due to the breakdown in correlation between climate variables. We provide unique insight into the mechanisms driving koala distribution and illustrate the importance of subtle relationships between the timing of weather events, particularly rain relative to hot-spells, in driving species-climate relationships and distributions. By unpacking the mechanisms captured by correlative SDMs, we can increase our certainty in forecasts of climate change impacts on species.",,,,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950; Briscoe, Natalie/0000-0003-0049-8956",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Arctic cod demonstrated a cold-water, stenothermic response in that there was relatively high growth at 0 A degrees C (0.73 % day(-1)), near-maximal growth at 5 A degrees C (1.35 % day(-1)) and negative impacts on activity, growth and survival at 16 A degrees C. In contrast, saffron cod demonstrated a warmer-water, eurythermic response, and temperature had a positive effect on growth and condition beyond 16 A degrees C. However, despite these distinct thermal responses, walleye pollock and Pacific cod grew 2-3 times faster than Arctic gadids across a relatively broad temperature range above 5 A degrees C. These results, coupled with possible northward expansion by both Pacific cod and walleye pollock, suggest Arctic cod are highly vulnerable to continued climate change in the Arctic, especially in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas where temperatures already exceed 14 A degrees C in the summer growth period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,JUN,2016,39,6,,,SI,,1127,1135,,10.1007/s00300-015-1761-5,,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,,,WOS:000378782300015,,,,,

In the SW of Iberian Peninsula pollen from Quercus species is often the most abundant in the air and their flowering phenology show changes in seasonal pollination affected by meteorological parameters. This study aims to investigate airborne pollen data of Quercus from a city on the SW Iberian Peninsula over a 20 year period and to analyse the trends in these data and their relationship with meteorological parameters using time series analysis and propose a predictable model to forecast their concentration. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from 1994 to 2013 in Badajoz (SW Spain) using a 7-day Burkard spore trap. The main pollen season for Quercus pollen lasted, on average, 59 days, ranging from 31 to 80 days, from 28th March to 27th May. The model proposed to forecast the airborne pollen concentration is described by Eq. (1). This expression is composed of two terms: the first term represents the resilience of the pollen concentration trend in the air according to the average concentration of the previous 10 days; the second term is obtained from considerations of the actual pollen concentration value, which is calculated based on the most representative climatic variables multiplied by a fitting coefficient. In order to obtain the best fit the model was developed in four partial time series of 5 years, each of one with a high level of accuracy, although a general model was calculated.

Ocean temperature, for example, can change the growth rate of cultured animals, or the distribution of wild stocks. In turn these impacts may require changes in fishing or farming practices. In addition to short-term environmental fluctuations, long-term climate-related trends are also resulting in new conditions, necessitating adjustment in fishing, farming and management approaches. Longer-term climate forecasts, however, are seen as less relevant by many in the seafood sector owing to more immediate concerns. Seasonal forecasts provide insight into upcoming environmental conditions, and thus allow improved decision making. Forecasts based on dynamic ocean models are now possible and offer improved performance relative to statistical forecasts, particularly given baseline shifts in the environment as a result of climate change. Seasonal forecasting is being used in marine farming and fishing operations in Australia, including wild tuna and farmed salmon and prawns, to reduce uncertainty and manage business risks. Forecast variables include water temperature, rainfall and air temperature, and are considered useful up to approximately 4months into the future, depending on the region and season of interest. Species-specific habitat forecasts can also be made by combining these environment forecasts with biological habitat preference data. Seasonal forecasts are useful when a range of options are available for implementation in response to the forecasts.

We propose a Bayesian model framework for analog forecasting, building upon previous analog methods but accounting for parameter uncertainty. Thus, unlike traditional analog forecasting methods, the use of Bayesian modeling allows one to rigorously quantify uncertainty to obtain realistic posterior predictive distributions. The model is applied to the long-lead time forecasting of mid-May averaged soil moisture anomalies in Iowa over a high-resolution grid of spatial locations. Sea surface temperature is used to find past time periods with similar trajectories to the current pre-forecast period. The analog model is developed on projection coefficients from a basis expansion of the soil moisture and sea surface temperature fields. Separate models are constructed for locations falling in each Iowa Crop Reporting District, and the forecasting ability of the proposed model is compared against a variety of alternative methods and metrics.

We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information.

Biological invasions proceed through a series of transition probabilities (i.e., introduction, establishment, spread, and impact), and each of these presents opportunities for management. Recent research advances have improved estimates of probability and associated uncertainty. Improvements have come from species-specific trait-based risk assessments (of estimates of introduction, establishment, spread, and impact probabilities, especially from pathways of commerce in living organisms), spatially explicit dispersal models (introduction and spread, especially from transportation pathways), and species distribution models (establishment, spread, and impact). Results of these forecasting models combined with improved and cheaper surveillance technologies and practices [e.g., environmentalDNA( eDNA), drones, citizen science] enable more efficient management by focusing surveillance, prevention, eradication, and control efforts on the highest-risk species and locations. Bioeconomic models account for the interacting dynamics within and between ecological and economic systems, and allow decision makers to better understand the financial consequences of alternative management strategies.

Unfortunately, for complex system models the posterior distribution is often high dimensional and analytically intractable, and sampling methods are required to approximate the target. In this paper I review the basic theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and introduce a MATLAB toolbox of the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm developed by Vrugt at al. (2008a, 2009a) and used for Bayesian inference in fields ranging from physics, chemistry and engineering, to ecology, hydrology, and geophysics. This MATLAB toolbox provides scientists and engineers with an arsenal of options and utilities to solve posterior sampling problems involving (among others) bimodality, high-dimensionality, summary statistics, bounded parameter spaces, dynamic simulation models, formal/informal likelihood functions (GLUE), diagnostic model evaluation, data assimilation, Bayesian model averaging, distributed computation, and informative/non-informative prior distributions. The DREAM toolbox supports parallel computing and includes tools for convergence analysis of the sampled chain trajectories and post-processing of the results. Seven different case studies illustrate the main capabilities and functionalities of the MATLAB toolbox. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

Culling or regulated harvest is often used to control overabundant species. These methods are difficult to implement in national parks, other types of conservation reserves, or in residential areas where public hunting may be forbidden by policy. As a result, fertility control has been recommended as a non-lethal alternative for regulating ungulate populations. We evaluate this alternative using white-tailed deer in national parks in the vicinity of Washington, D.C., USA as a model system. Managers seek to reduce densities of white-tailed deer from the current average (50 deer per km(2)) to decrease harm to native plant communities caused by deer. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model using 13 years of population estimates from 8 national parks in the National Capital Region Network. We offer a novel way to evaluate management actions relative to goals using short term forecasts. Our approach confirms past analyses that fertility control is incapable of rapidly reducing deer abundance. Fertility control can be combined with culling to maintain a population below carrying capacity with a high probability of success. This gives managers confronted with problematic overabundance a framework for implementing management actions with a realistic assessment of uncertainty.",,,,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,9-Dec,2015,10,12,,,,,,,e0143122,10.1371/journal.pone.0143122,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000366903300011,,,,,

In addition, we examine the extent to which the assessment of alternative scorecards differs across established and novel indicators of predictive accuracy. Finally, we explore whether more accurate classifiers are managerial meaningful. Our study provides valuable insight for professionals and academics in credit scoring.

Bison are infected with brucellosis (Brucella abortus) and their seasonal movements can expose livestock to infection. Yellowstone National Park has embarked on a program of adaptive management of bison, which requires a model that assimilates data to support management decisions. We constructed a Bayesian state-space model to reveal the influence of brucellosis on the Yellowstone bison population. A frequency-dependent model of brucellosis transmission was superior to a density-dependent model in predicting out-of-sample observations of horizontal transmission probability. A mixture model including both transmission mechanisms converged on frequency dependence. Conditional on the frequency-dependent model, brucellosis median transmission rate was 1.87 yr(-1). The median of the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive ratio (R-0) was 1.75. Seroprevalence of adult females varied around 60% over two decades, but only 9.6 of 100 adult females were infectious. Brucellosis depressed recruitment; estimated population growth rate averaged 1.07 for an infected population and 1.11 for a healthy population. We used five-year forecasting to evaluate the ability of different actions to meet management goals relative to no action. Annually removing 200 seropositive female bison increased by 30-fold the probability of reducing seroprevalence below 40% and increased by a factor of 120 the probability of achieving a 50% reduction in transmission probability relative to no action. Annually vaccinating 200 seronegative animals increased the likelihood of a 50% reduction in transmission probability by fivefold over no action. However, including uncertainty in the ability to implement management by representing stochastic variation in the number of accessible bison dramatically reduced the probability of achieving goals using interventions relative to no action. Because the width of the posterior predictive distributions of future population states expands rapidly with increases in the forecast horizon, managers must accept high levels of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the necessity of iterative, adaptive management with relatively short-term commitment to action and frequent reevaluation in response to new data and model forecasts. We believe our approach has broad applications.",,,,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The new trigger is added as an additional criterion in the simplified Arakawa-Schubert scheme for deep convection. Seasonal forecasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the new triggering mechanism in the representation of the Indian summer monsoon in the CFSv2. The HCF trigger improves the seasonal representation of precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. The new triggering mechanism leads to a significant, albeit relatively small, improvement in the bias of seasonal precipitation totals. In addition, the new trigger improves the representation of the seasonal precipitation cycle including the monsoon onset, and the probability distribution of precipitation intensities. The mechanism whereby the HCF improves convection over India seems to be related not only to a better representation of the background state of atmospheric convection but also to an increase in the frequency in which SAS is triggered. As a result, there was an increase in convective precipitation over India favored by the availability of moist convective instability.

It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used.

Information about future climate conditions on a range of time scales can improve risk management, buffer production against unfavourable environmental conditions, and allow maximised production during opportune times. Seasonal forecasting, providing information beyond weather forecasting up to several months into the future, can aid such decision making. In north-east Australian coastal pond-based prawn farms environmental stresses influence timing of farming periods, animal growth and survival. Here we describe the development, packaging and provision of regional and local forecast products, derived from the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA; version 2), to the Queensland prawn industry. Product development followed a three-stage process; (i) assessment of management needs and critical timescales, (ii) development and evaluation of the forecast products, and (iii) forecast implementation and refinement of the forecast products. Prawn farm managers identified the critical forecast variables as minimum and maximum air temperatures and rainfall at lead times of up to 2-3 months. The POAMA forecast skill for all three variables was evaluated, with three spatially averaged regional environmental indexes derived from POAMA showing a strong relationship with large-scale observed conditions. Forecast accuracy was assessed using model hindcast data together with historical observations, and was similar in all three regions, higher for temperature than rainfall, and declined with lead time in all cases. Forecast indices were then scaled using local weather station information for a subset of prawn farms in the study. Discussion with prawn farm managers helped refine the format and visualisation of the forecasts. Tailored forecast packages were then delivered through a web-based system and directly by email. These forecasts could aid a range of management decisions, and user feedback led to further refinement. This approach has great potential to be extended to other coastal aquaculture industries using these and other environmental variables. Information about future conditions, such as provided by seasonal forecasting, can assist aquaculture managers in development of production plans that will be more robust to short-term environmental variability and represents the first adaptation step on a pathway to coping with longer term climate change.

However, in many regions, changing environments are reducing the utility of this experience. In the Great Australian Bight, recent environmental changes have modified the summer distribution of southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii). This has affected the timing and location of fishing activity and contributed to economic impacts, at the same time as international competition is lowering value of the catch. The SBT purse-seine fishery is managed under a strict quota, so catching more fish is not an option to reduce fixed costs; instead fish must be caught more efficiently in a changing environment. Following discussion with industry stakeholders, we developed a seasonal forecast system based on a three stage process. We first assessed needs through discussions with industry. We then developed a SBT habitat forecast system based on a seasonal environmental forecasting model (POAMA: the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia) coupled with a habitat preference model for SBT (developed using data from tagged fish). Based on a historical evaluation of the environmental forecasting model and the habitat model, we expect temperature-based habitat forecasts to have useful skill up to two months into the future during the months of interest. The final stage involved forecast delivery via an industry-specific website and engagement with stakeholders, which led to improved presentation and contextualization of the forecasts. The forecasts, which are updated daily, are now being used by SBT fishers and have proven a useful aid in their decision-making. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of the skill of SST anomaly forecasts within coastal ecosystems accounting for the majority of global fish yields, however, has been minimal. This reflects coarse global forecast system resolution and past emphasis on the predictability of ocean basin-scale SST variations. This paper assesses monthly to inter-annual SST anomaly predictions in coastal ""Large Marine Ecosystems"" (LMEs). We begin with an analysis of 7 well-observed LMEs adjacent to the United States and then examine how mechanisms responsible for prediction skill in these systems are reflected in predictions for LMEs globally. Historical SST anomaly estimates from the 1/4 degrees daily Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature reanalysis (OISST.v2) were first found to be highly consistent with in-situ measurements for 6 of the 7 U.S. LMEs. Thirty years of retrospective forecasts from climate forecast systems developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (CM2.5-FLOR) and the National Center for Environmental Prediction (CFSv2) were then assessed against OISST.v2. Forecast skill varied widely by LME, initialization month, and lead but there were many cases of high skill that also exceeded that of a persistence forecast, some at leads greater than 6 months. Mechanisms underlying skill above persistence included accurate simulation of (a) seasonal transitions between less predictable locally generated and more predictable basin-scale SST variability; (b) seasonal transitions between different basin-scale influences; (c) propagation of SST anomalies across seasons through sea ice; and (d) re-emergence of previous anomalies upon the breakdown of summer stratification. Globally, significant skill above persistence across many tropical systems arises via mechanisms (a) and (b). Combinations of all four mechanisms contribute to less prevalent but nonetheless significant skill in extratropical systems. While continued refinement of global climate forecast systems and observations are needed to improve coastal SST anomaly prediction and extend predictions to other ecosystem relevant variables (e.g., salinity), present skill warrants close examination of forecasts for marine resource applications.

It is, however, biased: when used to select among competing prediction methods it systematically selects those whose predictions are too low. This has not been widely discussed and so is not generally known among practitioners. We explain why this happens. We investigate an alternative relative accuracy measure which avoids this bias: the log of the accuracy ratio, that is, log (prediction/actual). Relative accuracy is particularly relevant if the scatter in the data grows as the value of the variable grows (heteroscedasticity). We demonstrate using simulations that for heteroscedastic data (modelled by a multiplicative error factor) the proposed metric is far superior to MAPE for model selection. Another use for accuracy measures is in fitting parameters to prediction models Minimum MAPE models do not predict a simple statistic and so theoretical analysis is limited. We prove that when the proposed metric is used instead, the resulting least squares regression model predicts the geometric mean. This important property allows its theoretical properties to be understood.",,,,,"Tofallis, Chris/0000-0001-6150-0218",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J OPER RES SOC,J. Oper. Res.

Here, we appraise different forecasting methods with a particular focus on the modelling of species populations. We show how simple extrapolation of current trends in state is often inadequate because environmental drivers change in intensity over time and new drivers emerge. However, statistical models, incorporating relationships with drivers, simply offset the prediction problem, requiring us to forecast how the drivers will themselves change over time. Some authors approach this problem by focusing in detail on a single driver, whilst others use storyline' scenarios, which consider projected changes in a wide range of different drivers. We explain why both approaches are problematic and identify a compromise to model key drivers and interactions along with possible response options to help inform environmental management. We also highlight the crucial role of validation of forecasts using independent data. Although these issues are relevant for all types of ecological forecasting, we provide examples based on forecasts for populations of UK butterflies. We show how a high goodness-of-fit for models used to calibrate data is not sufficient for good forecasting.

For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner-recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.",,,,"Hsieh, Chih-hao/B-3797-2008","Hsieh, Chih-hao/0000-0001-5935-7272; Ye, Hao/0000-0002-8630-1458",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

However, since the management is based on a target escapement strategy, and most capelin die after spawning, viewed in retrospect, there is hardly any possibility of checking whether the forecast underpinning the quota was actually realistic. The forecast using Captool for the period from 1 October up to capelin spawning time at 1 April relies on a forecast of cod abundance during this period. This estimate of cod abundance is, in turn, based on a cod assessment from the previous spring. By rerunning the Captool model, where the cod forecast is replaced with the actual amount of cod from the cod assessment model run later in time, we show that considerably smaller annual quotas would have been advised if the true amount of cod had been known when the capelin quota was set. We discuss this fact in light of the present knowledge about recruitment success of capelin during the period. Our conclusion is that either the acoustic stock size estimates of capelin have been consistently underestimating the true stock size, the predation model overestimates the natural mortality of capelin during winter, the minimum spawning stock size considered necessary to uphold normal recruitment (B-lim) built into the harvest control rule is higher than needed to secure good recruitment, or a combination of these.",,,,", Gjosater/V-7898-2019",", Gjosater/0000-0001-7694-6503",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR BIOL RES,Mar.

While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections.

Using nonlinear forecasting models, we analysed over 200 time series of survey abundance and landings from two distinct ecosystems for patterns of dynamic complexity (dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics) and predictability. Differences in system dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics were associated with time series that reflected human intervention via fishing effort, implying the coupling between human and natural systems generated dynamics distinct from those detected in the natural resource subsystem alone. Estimated dimensionality was highest for landings and higher in abundance indices of unfished species than fished species. Fished species were more likely to display nonlinear dynamics than unfished species, and landings were significantly less predictable than abundance indices. Results were robust to variation in life history characteristics. Dynamics were predictable over a 1-year time horizon in seventy percent of time series, but predictability declined exponentially over a 5-year horizon. The ability to make predictions in fisheries systems is therefore extremely limited. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-system comparative study, and the first at the scale of individual species, to analyse empirically the dynamic complexity observed in fisheries data and to quantify predictability broadly.

It has been hypothesized that trees with diffuse-porous xylem anatomy and early successional species may respond most to warming. Within species, northern populations may respond most due to the fact that growing seasons are relatively short. Species most sensitive to spring temperature may show little overall response to warming if reduced chilling in fall/winter offsets accelerated winter/spring development. Because current thermal models consider only highly aggregated variables, for example degree-days or chilling units (temperature sums for a season or year), they may not accurately represent warming effects. We show that assumptions contained in current thermal (degree-day) models are unrealistic for climate change analysis. Critical threshold parameters are not identifiable, and they do not actually have much to do with thresholds for development. Traditional models further overlook the discrete nature of observations, observation error and the continuous response of phenological development to temperature variation. An alternative continuous development model (CDM) that addresses these problems is applied to a large experimental warming study near northern and southern boundaries of 15 species in the eastern deciduous forest of the USA, in North Carolina and Massachusetts. Results provide a detailed time course of phenological development, including vernalization during winter and warming in spring, and challenge the basic assumptions of thermal models. Where traditional models find little evidence of a chilling effect (most are insignificant or have the wrong sign), the continuous development model finds evidence of chilling effects in most species. Contrary to the hypothesis that northern populations respond most, we find southern populations are most responsive. Because northern populations already have a compressed period for spring development, they may lack flexibility to further advance development. A stronger response in the southern range could allow residents to resist northward migration of immigrants as climate warms. If potential invaders fail to exploit a prolonged growing season to the same degree as residents, then there is a resident advantage. Hypothesized effects of warming for xylem anatomy and successional status are not supported by the 15 species in this study. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",,,,,"Salk, Carl/0000-0003-2833-8292",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Methodologies exist to predict basinwide, seasonally aggregated TC activity months, seasons, and even years in advance. It is shown that a newly developed high-resolution global climate model can produce skillful forecasts of seasonal TC activity on spatial scales finer than basinwide, from months and seasons in advance of the TC season. The climate model used here is targeted at predicting regional climate and the statistics of weather extremes on seasonal to decadal time scales, and comprises high-resolution (50 km x 50 km) atmosphere and land components as well as more moderate-resolution (similar to 100 km) sea ice and ocean components. The simulation of TC climatology and interannual variations in this climate model is substantially improved by correcting systematic ocean biases through ""flux adjustment."" A suite of 12-month duration retrospective forecasts is performed over the 1981-2012 period, after initializing the climate model to observationally constrained conditions at the start of each forecast period, using both the standard and flux-adjusted versions of the model. The standard and flux-adjusted forecasts exhibit equivalent skill at predicting Northern Hemisphere TC season sea surface temperature, but the flux-adjusted model exhibits substantially improved basinwide and regional TC activity forecasts, highlighting the role of systematic biases in limiting the quality of TC forecasts.

A model ensemble for simulating plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret (Israel) from 1988 to 1999 has been induced from electronically-measurable predictor variables (EMPV) such as water temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. It cascade wise predicts the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios TN/TP, concentrations of chlorophyta, baccilariophyta, cyanophyta and dinophyta, as well as densities of rotifera, cladocera and copepoda solely from EMPV. The best coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been achieved with 0.6 by the dinophyta model, 0.45 by the rotifera model and 0.44 by the bacillariophyta model. The worst coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been produced by the cladocera model with 0.24 and by the TN/TP model with 0.28. Despite the differences in the r(2) values and apart from the cladocera model, the remaining models matched reasonably well seasonal and interannual plankton dynamics observed over 11 years in Lake Kinneret. The model ensemble developed by HEA also revealed ecological thresholds and relationships determining plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret solely based on in situ predictor variables.

Two approaches have been developed to apply management strategy evaluation to evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the performance of management strategies. The ""mechanistic approach"" estimates the relationship between the environment and elements of the population dynamics of the fished species and makes predictions for population trends using the outputs from global climate models. In contrast, the ""empirical approach"" examines possible broad scenarios without explicitly identifying mechanisms. Many reviewed studies have found that modifying management strategies to include environmental factors does not improve the ability to achieve management goals much, if at all, and only if the manner in which these factors drive the system is well known.

OBJECTIVE: We estimated heat-mortality associations based on forecast and observed weather data in Detroit, Michigan, and compared the accuracy of forecast products for predicting heat waves. METHODS: We derived and compared apparent temperature (AT) and heat wave days (with heat waves defined as >= 2 days of daily mean AT >= 95th percentile of warm-season average) from weather observations and six different forecast products. We used Poisson regression with and without adjustment for ozone and/or PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) to estimate and compare associations of daily all-cause mortality with observed and predicted AT and heat wave days. RESULTS : The 1-day-ahead forecast of a local operational product, Revised Digital Forecast, had about half the number of false positives compared with all other forecasts. On average, controlling for heat waves, days with observed AT = 25.3 degrees C were associated with 3.5% higher mortality (95% CI: -1.6, 8.8%) than days with AT = 8.5 degrees C. Observed heat wave days were associated with 6.2% higher mortality (95% CI: -0.4, 13.2%) than non-heat wave days. The accuracy of predictions varied, but associations between mortality and forecast heat generally tended to overestimate heat effects, whereas associations with forecast heat waves tended to underestimate heat wave effects, relative to associations based on observed weather metrics.

A localized Ensemble Kalman filter was used to assimilate weekly diffuse light attenuation coefficient data, K-d(443) from SeaWiFs, into an ecosystem model of the western English Channel. The spatial distributions of (unassimilated) surface chlorophyll from satellite, and a multivariate time series of eighteen biogeochemical and optical variables measured in situ at one long-term monitoring site were used to evaluate the system performance for the year 2006. Assimilation reduced the root mean square error and improved the correlation with the assimilated K-d(443) observations, for both the analysis and, to a lesser extent, the forecast estimates, when compared to the reference model simulation. Improvements in the simulation of (unassimilated) ocean colour chlorophyll were less evident, and in some parts of the Channel the simulation of this data deteriorated. The estimation errors for the (unassimilated) in situ data were reduced for most variables with some exceptions, e.g. dissolved nitrogen. Importantly, the assimilation adjusted the balance of ecosystem processes by shifting the simulated food web towards the microbial loop, thus improving the estimation of some properties, e.g. total particulate carbon. Assimilation of K-d(443) outperformed a comparative chlorophyll assimilation experiment, in both the estimation of ocean colour data and in the simulation of independent in situ data. These results are related to relatively low error in K-d(443) data, and because it is a bulk optical property of marine ecosystems. Assimilation of remotely-sensed optical properties is a promising approach to improve the simulation of biogeochemical and optical variables that are relevant for ecosystem functioning and climate change studies.

It is shown that the SPOD, a sea surface temperatures (SST) seesaw between the subtropics and extratropics, is the dominant mode of the interannual variability in the South Pacific in both observations and CFSv2 simulation. CFSv2 also reproduces the seasonal phase-locking of the observed SPOD, with the anomaly pattern developing in austral spring, peaking in summer, and decaying in autumn. Composite analyses based on both observational and model data suggest that in the warm phase of SPOD, positive SST anomaly (SSTA) is initiated by weakened westerly winds over the central South Pacific in austral spring, which suppress the surface evaporative heat loss and reduce the oceanic mixed layer depth, both contributing to the SST warming. The wind-SST-mixed layer anomalies then evolve coherently over the next two seasons while the cold SSTA develops to the north. The wind perturbations are in turn a response to El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which forces an atmospheric planetary wave train, the Pacific-South American pattern, emanating from an anomalous heat source in the tropical western Pacific. Moreover, SPOD is significantly correlated with the southern annular mode (SAM) while the latter is also significantly correlated with the ENSO index. This suggests that ENSO's influence on the SPOD may be partially conveyed through SAM.",,,,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011; Kinter, James/A-8610-2015; Zhu, Jieshun/G-5524-2012","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400; Kinter, James/0000-0002-6277-0559; Zhu, Jieshun/0000-0002-1508-9808",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

A recent UK governmental report asked: how good are seasonal forecasts on a scale of 1-5 (where 5 is very good), and how good can we expect them to be in 30 years time? Seasonal forecasts are made from ensembles of integrations of numerical models of climate. We argue that 'goodness' should be assessed first and foremost in terms of the probabilistic reliability of these ensemble-based forecasts; reliable inputs are essential for any forecast-based decision-making. We propose that a '5' should be reserved for systems that are not only reliable overall, but where, in particular, small ensemble spread is a reliable indicator of low ensemble forecast error. We study the reliability of regional temperature and precipitation forecasts of the current operational seasonal forecast system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, universally regarded as one of the world-leading operational institutes producing seasonal climate forecasts. A wide range of 'goodness' rankings, depending on region and variable (with summer forecasts of rainfall over Northern Europe performing exceptionally poorly) is found.

A common approach to produce these forecasts uses time-series models, of different types, fit to time series of counts. Similar time-series models are used in many other disciplines, however relative to the data available in these other disciplines, population data are often unusually short and noisy and models that perform well for data from other disciplines may not be appropriate for population data. In order to study the performance of time-series forecasting models for natural animal population data, we assembled 2379 time series of vertebrate population indices from actual surveys. Our data were comprised of three vastly different types: highly variable (marine fish productivity), strongly cyclic (adult salmon counts), and small variance but long-memory (bird and mammal counts). We tested the predictive performance of 49 different forecasting models grouped into three broad classes: autoregressive time-series models, non-linear regression-type models and non-parametric time-series models. Low-dimensional parametric autoregressive models gave the most accurate forecasts across a wide range of taxa; the most accurate model was one that simply treated the most recent observation as the forecast. More complex parametric and non-parametric models performed worse, except when applied to highly cyclic species. Across taxa, certain life history characteristics were correlated with lower forecast error; specifically, we found that better forecasts were correlated with attributes of slow growing species: large maximum age and size for fishes and high trophic level for birds. Synthesis Evaluating the data support for multiple plausible models has been an integral focus of many ecological analyses. However, the most commonly used tools to quantify support have weighted models' hindcasting and forecasting abilities. For many applications, predicting the past may be of little interest. Concentrating only on the future predictive performance of time series models, we performed a forecasting competition among many different kinds of statistical models, applying each to many different kinds of vertebrate time series of population abundance. Low-dimensional (simple) models performed well overall, but more complex models did slightly better when applied to time series of cyclic species (e.g. salmon).",,,,"Collen, Ben/F-2543-2016; Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014; Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019","Collen, Ben/0000-0003-2564-4243; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2014,123,6,,,,,652,661,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2014.00916.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000335721400002,,,,,

This study provides a framework to accomplish this task in salmon-bearing streams of the northwestern United States, where land-use-related reductions in riparian shading have caused changes in stream thermal regimes, and additional warming from projected climate change may result in significant losses of coldwater fish habitat over the next century. Predatory, nonnative smallmouth bass have also been introduced into many northwestern streams, and their range is likely to expand as streams warm, presenting an additional challenge to the persistence of threatened Pacific salmon. The goal of this work was to forecast the interactive effects of climate change, riparian management, and nonnative species on stream-rearing salmon and to evaluate the capacity of restoration to mitigate these effects. We intersected downscaled global climate forecasts with a local-scale water temperature model to predict mid- and end-of-century temperatures in streams in the Columbia River basin. We compared one stream that is thermally impaired due to the loss of riparian vegetation and another that is cooler and has a largely intact riparian corridor. Using the forecasted stream temperatures in conjunction with fish habitat models, we predicted how stream-rearing chinook salmon and bass distributions would change as each stream warmed. In the highly modified stream, end-of-century warming may cause near total loss of chinook salmon-rearing habitat and a complete invasion of the upper watershed by bass. In the less modified stream, bass were thermally restricted from the upstream-most areas. In both systems, temperature increases resulted in higher predicted spatial overlap between stream-rearing chinook salmon and potentially predatory bass in the early summer (two- to fourfold increase) and greater abundance of bass. We found that riparian restoration could prevent the extirpation of chinook salmon from the more altered stream and could also restrict bass from occupying the upper 31 km of salmon-rearing habitat. The proposed methodology and model predictions are critical for prioritizing climate-change adaptation strategies before salmonids are exposed to both warmer water and greater predation risk by nonnative species.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Prediction relies on models that describe our understanding of the major processes that underlie system dynamics and data about these processes and the present state of ecosystems. Prediction becomes more effective when models are well informed by data. A technological revolution in the capacity to collect data now provides very different opportunities to test hypotheses and project future dynamics than when many standard statistical tests were first developed. Data assimilation is an emerging statistical approach to combine models with data in a rigorous way to constrain model parameters and system states, identify model error, and improve ecological prediction. In this paper, we illustrate how data assimilation can improve ecological prediction to support decision-making by reviewing applications of data assimilation across four different research fields: (1) emerging infectious disease, (2) fisheries, (3) fire, and (4) the terrestrial carbon cycle. Across these fields, data assimilation substantially improves prediction accuracy, highlighting its important role in enabling predictive ecology. Data assimilation with regional and global models faces major challenges, such as the large number of parameters to be estimated, high computational demands, the need to integrate multiple and heterogeneous data sets, and complex social-ecological interactions.

The CFSv2 has useful MJO prediction skill out to 20 days at which the bivariate anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) drops to 0.5 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) increases to the level of the prediction with climatology. The prediction skill also shows a seasonal variation with the lowest ACC during the boreal summer and highest ACC during boreal winter. The prediction skills are evaluated according to the target as well as initial phases. Within the lead time of 10 days the ACC is generally greater than 0.8 and RMSE is less than 1 for all initial and target phases. At longer lead time, the model shows lower skills for predicting enhanced convection over the Maritime Continent and from the eastern Pacific to western Indian Ocean. The prediction skills are relatively higher for target phases when enhanced convection is in the central Indian Ocean and the central Pacific. While the MJO prediction skills are improved in CFSv2 compared to its previous version, systematic errors still exist in the CFSv2 in the maintenance and propagation of the MJO including (1) the MJO amplitude in the CFSv2 drops dramatically at the beginning of the prediction and remains weaker than the observed during the target period and (2) the propagation in the CFSv2 is too slow. Reducing these errors will be necessary for further improvement of the MJO prediction.",,,,", AK/B-6517-2008; Hung, Meng-Pai/O-2305-2019","Hung, Meng-Pai/0000-0003-4748-1932",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

To better detect such shifts, scientists need long-term phenological records covering many taxa and across a broad geographic distribution. To date, phenological observation efforts across the USA have been geographically limited and have used different methods, making comparisons across sites and species difficult. To facilitate coordinated cross-site, cross-species, and geographically extensive phenological monitoring across the nation, the USA National Phenology Network has developed in situ monitoring protocols standardized across taxonomic groups and ecosystem types for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine plant and animal taxa. The protocols include elements that allow enhanced detection and description of phenological responses, including assessment of phenological ""status"", or the ability to track presence-absence of a particular phenophase, as well as standards for documenting the degree to which phenological activity is expressed in terms of intensity or abundance. Data collected by this method can be integrated with historical phenology data sets, enabling the development of databases for spatial and temporal assessment of changes in status and trends of disparate organisms. To build a common, spatially, and temporally extensive multi-taxa phenological data set available for a variety of research and science applications, we encourage scientists, resources managers, and others conducting ecological monitoring or research to consider utilization of these standardized protocols for tracking the seasonal activity of plants and animals.",,,,"Miller-Rushing, Abraham/D-5102-2009; Crimmins, Theresa M./H-3575-2019","Miller-Rushing, Abraham/0000-0003-3203-0143; Crimmins, Theresa M./0000-0001-9592-625X; Gerst, Katharine/0000-0002-6154-906X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

We proposed a method for short-term forecasting of ET0 using the locally calibrated Hargreaves-Samani model and temperature forecasts. Daily meteorological data from four stations in China for the period 2001-2013 were collected to calibrate and validate the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model against the Penman-Monteith (PM) model, and the temperature forecasts for a 7-day horizon in 2012-2013 were collected and entered into the calibrated HS model to forecast the ET0. The proposed method was tested through comparisons between ET0 forecasts and ET0 calculated from observed meteorological data and the PM model. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.94, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within +/- 2 C) ranged from 60.48% to 76.29% and the accuracy of the maximum temperature forecast ranged from 50.18% to 62.94%. The accuracy of the ET0 forecast (error within +/- 1.5 mm day(-1)) ranged from 77.43% to 90.81%, the average values of the mean absolute error ranged from 0.64 to 1.02 mm day(-1), the average values of the root mean square error ranged from 0.87 to 1.36 mm day(-1), and the average values of the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.64 to 0.86. The sources of errors were the error in the temperature forecasts and the fact that the effects of wind speed and relative humidity were not considered in the HS model. The applications illustrated that the proposed method could provide daily ET0 forecasts with a certain degree of accuracy for real-time irrigation forecasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The data available consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity loads for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the locations of either the zones or stations. We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand.

POLLEN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOLOGICAL PHASES; AIRBORNE POLLEN; CROP YIELD; ANDALUSIA; PLANT; INDEXES; MODELS; AREAS,"Analysis of long-term airborne pollen counts makes it possible not only to chart pollen-season trends but also to track changing patterns in flowering phenology. Changes in higher plant response over a long interval are considered among the most valuable bioindicators of climate change impact. Phenological-trend models can also provide information regarding crop production and pollen-allergen emission. The interest of this information makes essential the election of the statistical analysis for time series study. We analysed trends and variations in the olive flowering season over a 30-year period (1982-2011) in southern Europe (Cordoba, Spain), focussing on: annual Pollen Index (PI); Pollen Season Start (PSS), Peak Date (PD), Pollen Season End (PSE) and Pollen Season Duration (PSD). Apart from the traditional Linear Regression analysis, a Seasonal-Trend Decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) and an ARIMA model were performed. Linear regression results indicated a trend toward delayed PSE and earlier PSS and PD, probably influenced by the rise in temperature. These changes are provoking longer flowering periods in the study area. The use of the STL technique provided a clearer picture of phenological behaviour. Data decomposition on pollination dynamics enabled the trend toward an alternate beating cycle to be distinguished from the influence of other stochastic fluctuations. Results pointed to show a rising trend in pollen production. With a view toward forecasting future phenological trends, ARIMA models were constructed to predict PSD, PSS and PI until 2016. Projections displayed a better goodness of fit than those derived from linear regression. Findings suggest that olive reproductive cycle is changing considerably over the last 30 years due to climate change. Further conclusions are that STL improves the effectiveness of traditional linear regression in trend analysis, and ARIMA models can provide reliable trend projections for future years taking into account the internal fluctuations in time series.

Predictions for subseasonal variability of zonal wind and precipitation are generally more skillful over the Asian and Australian monsoon regions than other monsoon regions. Climatologically, forecasts for the variations of dynamical monsoon indices have high skills at leads of about 2 weeks. However, apparent interannual differences exist, with high skills up to 5 weeks in exceptional cases. Comparisons for the relationships of monsoon indices with atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns between skillful and unskillful forecasts indicate that skills for subseasonal variability of a monsoon index depend partially on the degree to which the observed variability of the index attributes to the variation of large-scale circulation. Thus, predictions are often more skillful when the index is closely linked to atmospheric circulation over a broad region than over a regional and narrow range. It is also revealed that, the subseasonal variations of biases of winds, precipitation, and surface temperature over various monsoon regions are captured by a first mode with seasonally independent biases and a second mode with apparent phase transition of biases during summer. The first mode indicates the dominance of overall weaker-than-observed summer monsoons over major monsoon regions. However, at certain stages of monsoon evolution, these underestimations are regionally offset or intensified by the time evolving biases portrayed by the second mode. This feature may be partially related to factors such as the shifts of subtropical highs and intertropical convergence zones, the reversal of biases of surface temperature over some monsoon regions, and the transition of regional circulation system. The significant geographical differences in bias growth with increasing lead time reflect the distinctions of initial memory capability of the climate system over different monsoon regions.",,,,", AK/B-6517-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979-2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982-2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.",,,,,"Pena, Malaquias/0000-0002-3400-5075",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Those datasets were the (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as derived from the Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), (2) daytime and (3) nighttime land surface temperature (LST) as derived from Aqua satellite's MODIS, and (4) precipitation from the National Weather Service (NWS) Nexrad-based gridded data product. The originating MODIS data utilized were the globally produced 8-day, clear sky composited science products (MOD09Q1 and MYD11A2), while the US-wide NWS data were manipulated to mesh with the MODIS imagery both spatially and temporally by regridding and summing the otherwise daily measurements. The crop growing seasons of 2006-2011 were analyzed with each year bounded by 32 8-day periods from mid-February through late October. Land cover classifications known as the Cropland Data Layer as produced annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were used to isolate the input dataset pixels as to corn and soybeans for each of the corresponding years. The relevant pixels were then averaged by crop and time period to produce a county-level estimate of NDVI, the LSTs, and precipitation. They in turn were related to official annual NASS county level yield statistics. For the Corn Belt region as a whole, both corn and soybean yields were found to be positively correlated with NDVI in the middle of the summer and negatively correlated to daytime LST at that same time. Nighttime LST and precipitation showed no correlations to yield, regardless of the time prior or during the growing season. There was also slight suggestion of low NDVI and high daytime LST in the spring being positively related to final yields, again for both crops. Taking only NDVI and daytime LST as inputs from the 2006-2011 dataset, regression tree-based models were built and county-level, within-sample coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.93 were found for both crops. Limiting the models by systematically removing late season data showed the model performance to remain strong even at mid-season and still viable even earlier. Finally, the derived models were used to predict out-of-sample for the 2012 season, which ended up having an anomalous drought Yet, the county-level results compared reasonably well against official statistics with R-2 = 0.77 for corn and 0.71 for soybeans. The root-mean-square errors were 1.26 and 0.42 metric tons per hectare, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

Under stable climate, temporal variability typically results in higher dispersal.

Methods: I explore this potential link between behaviour and eco-evolutionary dynamics with controlled field experiments. The experiments manipulated densities of meadow voles foraging in large replicated enclosures. I used the lock-step connection between resource harvest and fitness to generate three fitness surrogates: giving-up densities from artificial resource patches, quitting-harvest rates, and time available for non-foraging behaviours that enhance fitness. Results: Per capita consumption from food trays did not change with population size. Time allocated to foraging increased with population density. Quitting-harvest rates in both safe and risky patches declined linearly with population density. The total amount of time necessary for a new individual to acquire sufficient energy for maintenance increased hyperbolically. Invasion landscapes based on the three fitness surrogates yielded the same behaviourally and evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of habitat selection. But the fitness benefits, subsequent convergence towards the ESS, and potential variation about the ESS, varied. Conclusions: Adaptive foraging behaviour is a reliable and rapid metric for assessing the evolutionary stability of habitat selection. This proof of concept suggests that behavioural metrics may play a prominent role in assessments of other strategies. We may even be able to use behavioural metrics to forecast ecological and evolutionary futures associated with ecological change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol. Ecol.

Here we present a set of analytical tools for synthesizing different levels of distributional and/or demographic data to produce meaningful assessments of invasion potential that can guide management at multiple phases of ongoing invasions, from dispersal to colonization to proliferation. We illustrate the utility of data-synthesis and data-model assimilation approaches with case studies of three well-known invasive speciesa vine, a marine mussel, and a freshwater crayfishunder current and projected future climatic conditions. Results from the integrated assessments reflect the complexity of the invasion process and show that the most relevant climatic variables can have contrasting effects or operate at different intensities across habitat types. As a consequence, for two of the study species climate trends will increase the likelihood of invasion in some habitats and decrease it in others. Our results identified and quantified both bottlenecks and windows of opportunity for invasion, mainly related to the role of human uses of the landscape or to disruption of the flow of resources.

We reviewed the evidence for phenotypic responses to recent climate change in fish. Changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature. Although these traits can evolve rapidly, only two studies attributed phenotypic changes formally to evolutionary mechanisms. The correlation-based methods most frequently employed point largely to fine-grained' population responses to environmental variability (i.e. rapid phenotypic changes relative to generation time), consistent with plastic mechanisms. Ultimately, many species will likely adapt to long-term warming trends overlaid on natural climate oscillations. Considering the strong plasticity in all traits studied, we recommend development and expanded use of methods capable of detecting evolutionary change, such as the long term study of selection coefficients and temporal shifts in reaction norms, and increased attention to forecasting adaptive change in response to the synergistic interactions of the multiple selection pressures likely to be associated with climate change.",,,,,"Hutchings, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1572-5429",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVOL APPL,Evol.

Experiments with online measured water quality data of the Lake Wivenhoe from 2007 to 2010 resulted in predictive models with 0.61 <= r(2) > 0.65 whereby again similar levels of EC and WT have been discovered as thresholds for outgrowth of C raciborskii. The highest validity of r(2) = 0.75 for an in situ data-based model has been achieved after considering time lags for EC by 7 days and dissolved oxygen by 1 day. These time lags have been discovered by a systematic screening of all possible combinations of time lags between 0 and 10 days for all electronically measurable variables. The so-developed model performs seven-day-ahead forecasts and is currently implemented and tested for early warning of C raciborskii blooms in the Wivenhoe reservoir. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to provide timely warnings for the allergy sufferers, a model was developed for forecasting ragweed pollen concentrations in the air. The development was based on the system for integrated modelling of atmospheric composition (SILAM) and concentrated on spatio-temporal modelling of ragweed flowering season and pollen release, which constitutes the emission term. Evaluation of the new model against multi-annual ragweed pollen observations demonstrated that the model reproduces well the main ragweed pollen season in the areas with major plant presence, such as the Pannonian Plain, the Lyon area in France, the Milan region in Italy, Ukraine and southern Russia. The predicted start of the season is mostly within 3 days of the observed for the majority of stations in these areas. The temporal correlation between modelled and observed concentrations exceeds 0.6 for the bulk of the stations. Model application to the seasons of 2005-2011 indicated the regions with high ragweed pollen concentrations, in particular the areas where allergenic thresholds are exceeded. It is demonstrated that, due to long-range transport of pollen, high-concentration areas are substantially more extensive than the heavily infested territories. (C) 2013 The Authors.

With the rate of environmental change increasing, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on a new urgency. Understanding the cues that drive long-distance animal movements is critical to predicting the fate of migrations under different environmental change scenarios and how large migratory herbivores will respond to increasing resource heterogeneity and anthropogenic influences. We used an individual-based modeling approach to investigate the influence of environmental conditions, monitored using satellite data, on departure date and movement speed of migrating zebras in Botswana. Daily zebra movements between dry and rainy season ranges were annotated with coincident observations of precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data set and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). An array of increasingly complex movement models representing alternative hypotheses regarding the environmental cues and controls for movement was parameterized and tested. The best and most justified model predicted daily zebra movement as two linear functions of precipitation rate and NDVI and included a modeled departure date as a function of cumulative precipitation. The model was highly successful at replicating both the timing and pace of seven actual migrations observed using GPS telemetry (R-2=0.914). It shows how zebras rapidly adjust their movement to changing environmental conditions during migration and are able to reverse migration to avoid adverse conditions or exploit renewed resource availability, a nomadic behavior which should lend them a degree of resilience to climate and environmental change. Our results demonstrate how competing individual-based migration models, informed by freely available satellite data, can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence for multiple hypotheses regarding the use of environmental cues in animal movement. This modeling framework can be applied to quantify how animals adapt the timing and pace of their movements to prevailing environmental conditions and to forecast migrations in near real time or under alternative environmental scenarios.",,,,"Bohrer, Gil/A-9731-2008","Bohrer, Gil/0000-0002-9209-9540; Beck, Pieter S A/0000-0002-0692-4779; Bartlam-Brooks, Hattie/0000-0002-1507-1712",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J GEOPHYS RES-BIOGEO,J.

This tree is frequently used in urban green spaces as ornamental specie. The flowering period is greatly influenced by the meteorological conditions, which directly affect its allergenic load in the atmosphere. The purpose of this study is to develop equations to predict the Platanus allergy risk periods as a function of the airborne pollen, the allergen concentration and the main meteorological parameters. The study was conducted by means two volumetric pollen samplers; a Lanzoni VPPS 2000 for the Platanus pollen sampling and a Burkard multivial Cyclone Sampler to collect the aeroallergen particles (Pla a_1). In addiction the Dot-Blot and the Raman spectroscopy methods were used to corroborate the results. The Pla a_l protein is recorded in the atmosphere after the presence of the Platanus pollen, which extend the Platanus pollen allergy risk periods. The Platanus pollen and the Pla al allergens concentration are associated with statistical significant variations of some meteorological variables: in a positive way with the mean and maximum temperature whereas the sign of the correlation coefficient is negative with the relative humidity. The lineal regression equation elaborated in order to forecast the Platanus pollen content in the air explain the 64.5% of variance of the pollen presence in the environment, whereas the lineal regression equation elaborated in order to forecast the aeroallergen a 54.1% of the Pla a_1 presence variance. The combination of pollen count and the allergen quantification must be assessed in the epidemiologic study of allergic respiratory diseases to prevent the allergy risk periods.

We evaluated how well data on 82 populations of 20 species of plants spanning 3 continents explained and predicted plant population dynamics. We parameterized stage-based matrix models with demographic data from individually marked plants and determined how well these models forecast population sizes observed at least 5 years into the future. Simple demographic models forecasted population dynamics poorly; only 40% of observed population sizes fell within our forecasts' 95% confidence limits. However, these models explained population dynamics during the years in which data were collected; observed changes in population size during the data-collection period were strongly positively correlated with population growth rate. Thus, these models are at least a sound way to quantify population status. Poor forecasts were not associated with the number of individual plants or years of data. We tested whether vital rates were density dependent and found both positive and negative density dependence. However, density dependence was not associated with forecast error. Forecast error was significantly associated with environmental differences between the data collection and forecast periods. To forecast population fates, more detailed models, such as those that project how environments are likely to change and how these changes will affect population dynamics, may be needed. Such detailed models are not always feasible. Thus, it may be wiser to make risk-averse decisions than to expect precise forecasts from models. Habilidad de los Modelos Matriciales para Explicar el Pasado y Predecir el Futuro de las Poblaciones de Plantas Resumen La incertidumbre asociada con el pronostico ecologico ha sido reconocida durante un largo tiempo pero rara vez se cuantifica su seguridad. Evaluamos que tan bien la informacion de 82 poblaciones de 20 especies de plantas a lo largo de 3 continentes explica y predice la dinamica de poblacion de las plantas. Realizamos parametros con modelos matriciales con base en estadios con datos demograficos a partir de plantas marcadas individualmente y determinamos que tan bien estos modelos pronostican el tamano de las poblaciones al menos 5 anos en el futuro. Los modelos demograficos simples pronosticaron pobremente las dinamicas de poblacion; solamente el 40% de las poblaciones observadas cayo dentro de los limites de confianza de 85% de nuestros pronosticos. Estos modelos sin embargo explicaron la dinamica de poblacion a lo largo de los anos en los que se colectaron datos; los cambios observados en el tamano de la poblacion durante el periodo de colecta de datos estuvieron positivamente correlacionados con la tasa de crecimiento de la poblacion. Asi, estos modelos son por lo menos una manera segura de cuantificar el estado de la poblacion. Los pronosticos debiles no estuvieron asociados con el numero de plantas individuales o con los anos de datos. Probamos si las tasas vitales dependian de la densidad y encontramos que existe dependencia hacia la densidad tanto positiva como negativa, sin embargo la dependencia de densidad no se asocio con el error de pronostico. El error de pronostico estuvo significativamente asociado con diferencias ambientales entre la recoleccion de datos y los periodos de pronostico. Para predecir el destino de las poblaciones se necesitan modelos mas detallados, como aquellos que proyectan los cambios probables en el ambiente y como estos cambios afectaran a la dinamica de las poblaciones.

However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.",,,,"Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/O-8956-2019; Kraft, Nathan J.

National governments and commercial entities are therefore paying increased attention to the cropping forecasts of important food-exporting countries as well as to their own domestic food production. Given the increased volatility of food markets and the rising incidence of climatic extremes affecting food production, food price spikes may increase in prevalence in future years(2-4). Here we present a global assessment of the reliability of crop failure hindcasts for major crops at two lead times derived by linking ensemble seasonal climatic forecasts with statistical crop models. We found that moderate-to-marked yield loss over a substantial percentage (26-33%) of the harvested area of these crops is reliably predictable if climatic forecasts are near perfect. However, only rice and wheat production are reliably predictable at three months before the harvest using within-season hindcasts. The reliabilities of estimates varied substantially by crop-rice and wheat yields were the most predictable, followed by soybean and maize. The reasons for variation in the reliability of the estimates included the differences in crop sensitivity to the climate and the technology used by the crop-producing regions.

Forage growth potential (FGP), the fraction of historical average production, is predicted as a weighted average of monthly precipitation from January through June. We calibrated and evaluated the DC tool in the Great Plains of the United States, using FGP and precipitation data from Colorado (CO), North Dakota (ND), and Wyoming (WY). In CO, FGP was most sensitive to precipitation in April and May, in ND to precipitation in April and June, and in WY to precipitation in April, May, and June. Weights in these months ranged from 0.16 to 0.52. Prediction was better for CO and WY than for ND. When January June precipitation was used, the tool correctly predicted 83% of the years with FGP reduced by drought for CO, 82% for WY, and only 67% for ND. Positive values of the True Skill Statistic (0.53 for CO, 0.42 for WY, and 0.17 for ND) indicate that FGP was classified as above or below average better than random selection. Predicting FGP earlier than April in CO and WY will require accurate forecasts of April June precipitation. Use of the DC is most limited by insufficient forage data to determine the site-specific relationships between FGP and monthly precipitation. Even so, the decision tool is useful for discriminating drought effects on FGP classification being above or below the long-term average, and it provides a quantitative prediction to producers for their destocking decisions in drought years.",,,,,"Green, Timothy/0000-0002-1441-8008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Eight dominant quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) modes identified by the extended empirical orthogonal function analysis are focused. In the CFSv2, QBW variability exhibits a significant weakening tendency with lead time for all seasons. For most QBWO modes, the variance drops to only 50 % of the initial value at lead time of 11-15 days. QBW variability has better prediction skill in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere. Skillful forecast can reach about 10-15 days for most modes but those in the winter hemisphere have better forecast skills. Among the eight QBWO modes, the North Pacific mode and the South Pacific (SP) mode have the highest forecast skills while the Asia-Pacific mode and the Central American mode have the lowest skills. For the Asia-Pacific and Central American modes, the forecasted QBWO phase shows an obvious eastward shift with increase in lead time compared to observations, indicating a smaller propagating speed. However, the predicted feature for the SP mode is more realistic. Air-sea coupling on the QBW time scale is perhaps responsible for the different prediction skills for different QBWO modes. In addition, most QBWO modes have better forecasting skills in El Nio years than in La Nia years. Different dynamical mechanisms for various QBWO modes may be partially responsible for the differences in prediction skill among different QBWO modes.",,,,"Wang, Hui/B-6516-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

We paired repeat measurements of plant canopy cover with climate at multiple sites across the Chihuahuan Desert over the last century to determine which plant species and functional types may be the most sensitive to climate change. We found that the dominant perennial grass, Bouteloua eriopoda, and species richness had nonlinear responses to summer precipitation, decreasing more in dry summers than increasing with wet summers. Dominant shrub species responded differently to the seasonality of precipitation and drought, but winter precipitation best explained changes in the cover of woody vegetation in upland grasslands and may contribute to woody-plant encroachment that is widespread throughout the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Temperature explained additional variability of changes in cover of dominant and subdominant plant species. Using a novel empirically based approach we identified climate pivot points that were indicative of shifts from increasing to decreasing plant cover over a range of climatic conditions. Reductions in cover of annual and several perennial plant species, in addition to declines in species richness below the long-term summer precipitation mean across plant communities, indicate a decrease in the productivity for all but the most drought-tolerant perennial grasses and shrubs in the Chihuahuan Desert.

That is, in many real-world applications the complexity and high-dimensionality of the data and/or process do not allow for routine model specification. For example, spatio-temporal count data often exhibit temporally varying over/underdispersion within the spatial domain. In order to accommodate such structure, while quantifying different sources of uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) model with dynamic dispersion. Motivated by the problem of predicting migratory bird settling patterns, we propose a threshold vector-autoregressive model for the CMP intensity parameter that allows for regime switching based on climate conditions. Additionally, to reduce the inherent high-dimensionality of the underlying process, we consider nonlinear dimension reduction through kernel principal component analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through out-of-sample one-year-ahead prediction of waterfowl migratory patterns across the United States and Canada. The proposed approach is of independent interest and illustrates the potential benefits of dynamic dispersion in terms of superior forecasting.

The CFSv2 was initialized from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) over 1982-2010. There was a systematic cold bias in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific during summer/fall. The cold bias in the Nino-3.4 index was about -2.5 degrees C in summer/fall before 1999 but suddenly changed to -1 degrees C around 1999, related to a sudden shift in the trade winds and equatorial subsurface temperature in the CFSR.The SST anomaly (SSTA) was computed by removing model climatology for the periods 1982-98 and 1999-2010 separately. The standard deviation (STD) of forecast SSTA agreed well with that of observations in 1982-98, but in 1999-2010 it was about 200% too strong in the eastern Pacific and 50% too weak near the date line during winter/spring. The shift in STD bias was partially related to change of ENSO characteristics: central Pacific (CP) El Ninos were more frequent than eastern Pacific (EP) El Ninos after 2000. The composites analysis shows that the CFSv2 had a tendency to delay the onset phase of the EP El Ninos in the 1980s and 1990s but predicted their decay phases well. In contrast, the CFSv2 predicted the onset phase of the CP El Ninos well but prolonged their decay phase.

The weights used to form the linear combination depend on the current predictor value and are chosen so that the linear combination of past predictor values approximates the current predictor value. The properties of the constructed analog method have previously been described as being distinct from those of linear regression. However, here the authors show that standard implementations of the constructed analog method give forecasts that are identical to linear regression forecasts. A consequence of this equivalence is that constructed analog forecasts based on many predictors tend to suffer from overfitting just as in linear regression. Differences between linear regression and constructed analog forecasts only result from implementation choices, especially ones related to the preparation and truncation of data. Two particular constructed analog implementations are shown to correspond to principal component regression and ridge regression. The equality of linear regression and constructed analog forecasts is illustrated in a Nino-3.4 prediction example, which also shows that increasing the number of predictors results in low-skill, high-variance forecasts, even at long leads, behavior typical of overfitting.

However, an increased understanding of temperature and precipitation influences on cattle weight gains is needed to optimize stocking rates and reduce enterprise risk associated with climatic variability. Yearling steer weight gain data collected at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station at light, moderate, and heavy stocking rates for 30 years (1982-2011) were used to examine the effects of spring (April-June) and summer (July-September) temperature and precipitation, as well as prior-growing-season (prior April-September) and fall/winter (October-March) precipitation, on beef production (kg . ha(-1)). At heavier stocking rates, steer production was more sensitive to seasonal weather variations. A novel finding was that temperature (relatively cool springs and warm summers) played a large predictive role on beef production. At heavier stocking rates, beef production was highest during years with cool, wet springs and warm, wet summers, corresponding to optimum growth conditions for this mixed C-3-C-4 plant community. The novelty and utility of these findings may increase the efficacy of stocking rate decision support tools. The parsimonious model structure presented here includes three-month seasonal clusters that are forecasted and freely available from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration up to a year in advance.

The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the prediction of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) by the new CFS version 2 (CFSv2) using the hindcast for 1983-2010, focusing on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. Many ASM features are well predicted by the CFSv2, including heavy monsoon rainfall centers, large-scale monsoon circulation patterns, and monsoon onset and retreat features. Several commonly used dynamical monsoon indices and their associated precipitation and circulation patterns can be predicted several months in advance. The CFSv2 has better skill in predicting the Southeast Asian monsoon than predicting the South Asian monsoon. Compared to CFS version 1 (CFSv1), the CFSv2 has increased skill in predicting large-scale monsoon circulation and precipitation features but decreased skill for the South Asian monsoon, although some biases in the CFSv1 still exist in the CFSv2, especially the weaker-than-observed western Pacific subtropical high and the exaggerated strong link of the ASM to ENSO. Comparison of CFSv2 hindcast with output from Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) simulations indicates that exclusion of ocean-atmosphere coupling leads to a weaker ASM. Compared to AMIP, both hindcast and CMIP show a more realistic annual cycle of precipitation, and the interannual variability of the ASM is better in hindcast. However, CMIP does not show any advantage in depicting the processes associated with the interannual variability of major dynamical monsoon indices compared to AMIP.",,,,", AK/B-6517-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J CLIMATE,J.

As part of our analysis we also tested the ability of MODIS to capture inter-annual variability in yields. Our results show that the MODIS two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) provides a better basis for predicting maize yields relative to the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of information related to crop phenology derived from MODIS significantly improved model performance within and across years. Surprisingly, using moderate spatial resolution data from the MODIS Land Cover Type product to identify agricultural areas did not degrade model results relative to using higher-spatial resolution crop-type maps developed by the USDA. Correlations between vegetation indices and yield were highest 65-75 days after greenup for maize and 80 days after greenup for soybeans. EVI2 was the best index for predicting maize yield in non-semi-arid counties (R-2 = 0.67), but the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed better in semi-arid counties (R-2 = 0.69), probably because the NDWI is sensitive to irrigation in semi-arid areas with low-density agriculture. NDVI and EVI2 performed equally well predicting soybean yield (R-2 = 0.69 and 0.70, respectively). In addition, EVI2 was best able to capture large negative anomalies in maize yield in 2005 (R-2 = 0.73). Overall, our results show that using crop phenology and a combination of EVI2 and NDWI have significant benefit for remote sensing-based maize and soybean yield models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, widespread use of models is limited by the technical challenges of model-data synthesis and information management. To address these challenges, we present an ecoinformatic workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), which facilitates model analysis. Herein we describe the PEcAn modules that synthesize plant trait data to estimate model parameters, propagate parameter uncertainties through to model output, and evaluate the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty. We illustrate a comprehensive approach to the estimation of parameter values, starting with a statement of prior knowledge that is refined by species-level data using Bayesian meta-analysis; this is the first use of a rigorous meta-analysis to inform the parameters of a mechanistic ecosystem model. Parameter uncertainty is propagated using ensemble methods to estimate model uncertainty. Variance decomposition allows us to quantify the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty; this information can be used to prioritize subsequent data collection. By streamlining the use of models and focusing efforts to identify and constrain the dominant sources of uncertainty in model output, the approach used by PEcAn can speed scientific progress. We demonstrate PEcAn's ability to incorporate data to reduce uncertainty in productivity of a perennial grass monoculture (Panicum virgatum L.) modeled by the Ecosystem Demography model. Prior estimates were specified for 15 model parameters, and species-level data were available for seven of these. Meta-analysis of species-level data substantially reduced the contribution of three parameters (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate, and stomatal slope) to overall model uncertainty. By contrast, root turnover rate, root respiration rate, and leaf width had little effect on model output; therefore trait data had little impact on model uncertainty. For fine-root allocation, the decrease in parameter uncertainty was offset by an increase in model sensitivity. Remaining model uncertainty is driven by growth respiration, fine-root allocation, leaf turnover rater, and specific leaf area. By establishing robust channels of feedback between data collection and ecosystem modeling, PEcAn provides a framework for more efficient and integrative science.",,,,"Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; LeBauer, David/N-2735-2013","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; LeBauer, David/0000-0001-7228-053X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Current patterns are updated hourly throughout the day on the EPA-AIRNow web site. Our contribution is to show how we can substantially improve upon current real-time forecasting systems. We introduce a down-scaler fusion model based on first differences of real- time monitoring data and numerical model output. The model has a flexible coefficient structure with an efficient computational strategy to fit model parameters. This strategy can be viewed as hybrid in that it blends offline model fitting with online predictions followed by fast spatial interpolation to produce the desired real- time forecast maps.

The validation of models obtained with HEA showed the best results for bacillariophyta and dinophyta resulting in coefficients of determination (r(2)) between the modeled and measured data of 0.54-0.79 and 0.29-0.76 for these phyla, respectively, suggesting good predictability of their dynamics. The lowest adequacy of HEA models was found for cyanophyta (r(2) of 0.28-0.46). Models that combined physical, chemical and biological inputs scored highest, whilst zooplankton-based models scored lowest in all experiments and indicated that top-down control of algal biomass could have only secondary effect. The input sensitivity analysis was used for testing the best phytoplankton models with threshold values determining high or low algal biomass and inhibitory-excitatory effects of specific parameters. Wavelets were tested to analyze two extreme cases of dinophyta dynamics in years of its exceptionally high and low developments to gain insights into lag times between the exert of key factor and algae response.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether the assimilation of satellite-derived bio-optical properties can improve the model predictions (phytoplankton population, chlorophyll) in a coastal ocean on time scales of 1-5 days. The Monterey Bay model consists of a physical model based on the Navy Coastal Ocean Model and a biochemical model which includes three nutrients, two phytoplankton groups (diatoms and small phytoplankton), two groups of zooplankton grazers, and two detrital pools. The Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation system is used for the assimilation of physical observations. For the assimilation of bio-optical observations, we used reduced-order Kalman filter with a stationary forecast error covariance. The forecast error covariance is specified in the subspace of the multivariate (bio-optical, physical) empirical orthogonal functions estimated from a monthlong model run. With the assimilation of satellite-derived bio-optical properties (chlorophyll a or absorption due to phytoplankton), the model was able to reproduce intensity and tendencies in subsurface chlorophyll distributions observed at water sample locations in the Monterey Bay, CA. Data assimilation also improved agreement between the observed and model-predicted ratios between diatoms and small phytoplankton populations. Model runs with or without assimilation of satellite-derived bio-optical observations show underestimated values of nitrate as compared to the water sample observations. We found that an instantaneous update of nitrate based on statistical relations between temperature and nitrate corrected the model underestimation of the nitrate fields during the multivariate update.",,,,"Frolov, Sergey/AAE-4019-2019; Gould, Richard/T-8787-2018","Frolov, Sergey/0000-0002-9081-1979; Gould, Richard/0000-0002-5149-048X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

To implement sustainable management plans, resource managers need to accurately forecast species abundance. Moreover, an ecosystem-based approach to management requires forecasting the dynamics of all relevant species and the ability to anticipate indirect effects of management decisions. It is therefore crucial to determine which forecasting methods are most robust to observational and structural uncertainty. Here we describe a nonparametric method for multispecies forecasting and evaluate its performance relative to a suite of parametric models. We found that, in the presence of noise, it is often possible to obtain more accurate forecasts from the nonparametric method than from the model that was used to generate the data. The inclusion of data from additional species yielded a large improvement for the nonparametric model, a smaller improvement for the control model, and only a slight improvement for the alternative parametric models.

This observation is perhaps unsurprising, because population dynamics are often strongly forced and highly nonlinear. Recently, however, numerous statistical techniques have been proposed for fitting highly parameterized mechanistic models to complex time series, potentially providing the machinery necessary for generating useful predictions. Alternatively, there is a wide variety of comparatively simple model-free forecasting methods that could be used to predict abundance. Here wepose a rather conservative challenge and ask whether a correctly specified mechanistic model, fit with commonly used statistical techniques, can provide better forecasts than simple model-free methods for ecological systems with noisy nonlinear dynamics. Using four different control models and seven experimental time series of flour beetles, we found that Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for fitting mechanistic models often converged on best-fit parameterizations far different from the known parameters. As a result, the correctly specified models provided inaccurate forecasts and incorrect inferences. In contrast, a model-free method based on state-space reconstruction gave the most accurate short-term forecasts, even while using only a single time series from the multivariate system. Considering the recent push for ecosystem-based management and the increasing call for ecological predictions, our results suggest that a flexible model-free approach may be the most promising way forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Autoregressive models were initially applied to US gross national product (GNP), and have been extended to nonlinear structures, such as the self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) models. We show that while these nonlinear models fit the in-sample data better than linear models, the out-of-sample forecast performance of extremely simple methods, such as the unconditional mean is competitive compared with both previously published linear and nonlinear models for GNP time series. Motivated by Occam's razor and the forecasting competitiveness of the unconditional mean, we seek parsimonious models which are based on simple assumptions, incorporate few parameters, and can generate accurate forecasts. We propose nonlinear and nonparametric models based on nearest neighbor and kernel regression by forming a state-space of time delayed GNP observations. The rationale of the proposed methodology lies in identification of local regions of state-space known as nearest neighbor sub-spaces, whereby we utilize future trajectories of the neighboring states and weight them using a double kernel estimator to generate density forecasts. The models proposed in this work incorporate only one or two parameters, and the model estimation framework relies on optimizing the performance of in-sample density forecasts. The proposed modeling approach does not require prior assumptions regarding the form of the error distribution, and can provide transition between regimes of growth and contraction. We compare the forecasts from proposed models with classical time series models for GNP and a range of benchmarks, and validate our results on two post-war GNP time series using different performance scores, such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).

The allergenic pollen content of the atmosphere varies according to climate, biogeography and vegetation. Minimisation of the pollen allergy symptoms is related to the possibility of avoidance of large doses of the allergen. Measurements performed in Szczecin over a period of 13 years (2000-2012 inclusive) permitted prediction of theoretical maximum concentrations of pollen grains and their probability for the pollen season of Poaceae,Artemisia and Ambrosia. Moreover, the probabilities were determined of a given date as the beginning of the pollen season, the date of the maximum pollen count, Seasonal Pollen Index value and the number of days with pollen count above threshold values. Materials and methods. Aerobiological monitoring was conducted using a Hirst volumetric trap (Lanzoni VPPS). Linear trend with determination coefficient (R-2) was calculated. Model for long-term forecasting was performed by the method based on Gumbel's distribution. Results. A statistically significant negative correlation was determined between the duration of pollen season of Poaceae and Artemisia and the Seasonal Pollen Index value. Seasonal, total pollen counts of Artemisia and Ambrosia showed a strong and statistically significant decreasing tendency. On the basis of Gumbel's distribution, a model was proposed for Szczecin, allowing prediction of the probabilities of the maximum pollen count values that can appear once in e.g. 5, 10 or 100 years. Conclusions. Short pollen seasons are characterised by a higher intensity of pollination than long ones. Prediction of the maximum pollen count values, dates of the pollen season beginning, and the number of days with pollen count above the threshold, on the basis of Gumbel's distribution, is expected to lead to improvement in the prophylaxis and therapy of persons allergic to pollen.",,,,"Wolski, Tomasz/K-1923-2017","Wolski, Tomasz/0000-0002-1368-6107",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ANN AGR ENV MED,Ann.

The development of the model is based on a double-threshold temperature sum model that describes the propagation of the flowering season and naturally links to the thermal time models to predict the onset and duration of flowering. For the flowering season, the emission model considers ambient humidity and precipitation rate, both of which suppress the pollen release, as well as wind speed and turbulence intensity, which promote it. These dependencies are qualitatively evaluated using the aerobiological observations. Reflecting the probabilistic character of the flowering of an individual tree in a population, the model introduces relaxation functions at the start and end of the season. The physical basis of the suggested birch pollen emission model is compared with another comprehensive emission module reported in literature.

Precipitation forecasts are compared with observed precipitation at point and catchment scales and at different temporal resolutions. The four models evaluated are the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS) including ACCESS-G with a 80 km resolution, ACCESS-R 37.5 km, ACCESS-A 12 km, and ACCESS-VT 5 km. The skill of the NWP precipitation forecasts varies considerably between rain gauging stations. In general, high spatial resolution (ACCESS-A and ACCESS-VT) and regional (ACCESS-R) NWP models overestimate precipitation in dry, low elevation areas and underestimate in wet, high elevation areas. The global model (ACCESS-G) consistently underestimates the precipitation at all stations and the bias increases with station elevation. The skill varies with forecast lead time and, in general, it decreases with the increasing lead time. When evaluated at finer spatial and temporal resolution (e. g. 5 km, hourly), the precipitation forecasts appear to have very little skill. There is moderate skill at short lead times when the forecasts are averaged up to daily and/or catchment scale. The precipitation forecasts fail to produce a diurnal cycle shown in observed precipitation. Significant sampling uncertainty in the skill scores suggests that more data are required to get a reliable evaluation of the forecasts. The non-smooth decay of skill with forecast lead time can be attributed to diurnal cycle in the observation and sampling uncertainty. Future work is planned to assess the benefits of using the NWP rainfall forecasts for short-term streamflow forecasting. Our findings here suggest that it is necessary to remove the systematic biases in rainfall forecasts, particularly those from low resolution models, before the rainfall forecasts can be used for streamflow forecasting.",,,,"Shrestha, Durga/B-5610-2013; Robertson, David/C-3643-2011; Wang, Quan J/D-2674-2012","Shrestha, Durga/0000-0002-5545-1736; Robertson, David/0000-0003-4230-8006; Wang, Quan J/0000-0002-8787-2738",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Collectively, these models have considerably increased our fundamental knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of ecosystem functions, processes, and structure. We explore three areas where models for rangeland management are often challenging for land managers and enterprise-level decision making: 1) coping with spatiotemporal and climatic variability in implementing scenario forecasting, risk assessments, and adaptive management; 2) addressing outputs of multiple ecosystem goods and services and determining whether they are synergistic or competitive; and 3) integrating experimental and experiential knowledge and observations into decision making. Increasing the utility of models for rangeland management remains a key frontier and a major research need for the modeling community and will be achieved less by further technical advances and model complexity and more by the use of existing topoedaphic databases, the capacity to readily incorporate new experimental and experiential knowledge, and the use of frameworks that facilitate outcome-based, adaptive decision making at the enterprise level with associated economic considerations. Opportunities exist for increasing the utility of models for decision making and adaptive rangeland management through better matching of model complexity with enterprise-level, decision-making goals. This could be accomplished by incorporating a fundamental understanding of herbivory, fire, and spatiotemporal interactions with weather patterns that affect multiple ecosystem functions. Most important, effective models would allow land managers in a changing and variable climate to 1) evaluate trade offs in producing multiple goods and services, 2) optimize the application of conservation practices spatially (comparing costs and benefits accrued across different timescales), and 3) incorporate manager capacity, including experience, skills, and labor input.",,,,,"Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736; Augustine, David/0000-0003-3144-0466",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Meteorological data used for model-based predictions of mosquito abundance and life cycle dynamics are typically acquired from ground-based weather stations: however, data availability and completeness are often limited by sparse networks and resource availability. In contrast, environmental measurements from satellite remote sensing are more spatially continuous and can be retrieved automatically. This study compared environmental measurements from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and in situ weather station data to examine their ability to predict the abundance of two important mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex tarsalis) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA from 2005 to 2010. The AMSR-E land parameters included daily surface water inundation fraction, surface air temperature, soil moisture, and microwave vegetation opacity. The AMSR-E derived models had better fits and higher forecasting accuracy than models based on weather station data despite the relatively coarse (25-km) spatial resolution of the satellite data. In the AMSR-E models, air temperature and surface water fraction were the best predictors of Aedes vexans, whereas air temperature and vegetation opacity were the best predictors of Cx. tarsalis abundance. The models were used to extrapolate spatial, seasonal, and interannual patterns of climatic suitability for mosquitoes across eastern South Dakota. Our findings demonstrate that environmental metrics derived from satellite passive microwave radiometry are suitable for predicting mosquito population dynamics and can potentially improve the effectiveness of mosquito-borne disease early warning systems.

As temperatures rise, cold-water fish distributions may shift and contract in response. Predicting the effects of projected stream warming in stream networks is complicated by the generally poor correlation between water temperature and air temperature. Spatial dependencies in stream networks are complex because the geography of stream processes is governed by dimensions of flow direction and network structure. Therefore, forecasting climate-driven range shifts of stream biota has lagged behind similar terrestrial modeling efforts. We predicted climate-induced changes in summer thermal habitat for 3 cold-water fish speciesjuvenile Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and bull trout (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. mykiss, and Salvelinus confluentus, respectively)in the John Day River basin, northwestern United States.

The spatial distribution of stream temperature extremes during summers from 1993 through 2009 was largely governed by solar radiation and interannual extremes of air temperature.

The question remains whether distant pollen sources need to be considered in reliable forecasts. We used the extended numerical weather prediction system COSMO-ART to simulate the release and transport of ragweed pollen in central Europe. A pollen episode (September 12-16, 2006) in north-eastern Germany was modeled in order to find out where the pollen originated. For this purpose, several different source regions were taken into account and their individual impact on the daily mean pollen concentration and the performance of the forecast were studied with the means of a 2 x 2 contingency table and skill scores. It was found that the majority of the pollen originated in local areas, but up to 20% of the total pollen load came from distant sources in Hungary. It is concluded that long-distance transport should not be neglected when predicting pollen concentrations.",,,,"Vogel, Heike/A-3196-2013; Magyar, Donat/B-2971-2009; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We use retrospective forecasts from the Met Office seasonal forecasting system, GloSea4, nominally initialized 1 month ahead of the target season. Initially, we define daily extremes to be events outside either the upper or lower deciles of the daily temperature distribution from the relevant season. This definition provides a threshold that is sufficiently ""extreme"" to be of interest to many users but moderate enough to allow a sufficient sample for verification and to be of regular use to users. We show that skill reduces slightly at more extreme thresholds. Correlations of predicted and observed numbers of upper or lower decile extreme days over a season are significantly greater than zero over much of the globe and, in general, are better than a persistence forecast. Forecast skill for seasonal mean temperature is similar to, but generally greater than, the skill of predictions of the number of extreme days. Observations have a strong relationship between the seasonal mean and the number of extreme days. We show that the skill in predicting the number of extreme days is largely a consequence of this relationship and occurs primarily through a shift in the distribution of the daily data rather than a change of its shape. The ability to predict the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and climate change are both significant contributors to the skill in predicting temperature extremes.

This will impact on the biological world and we need to be able to forecast its effects. In order to produce such forecasts, ecology needs to become more predictive-to develop the ability to understand how ecological systems will behave in future, changed, conditions. Further development of process-based models is required to allow such predictions to be made. Critical to the development of such models will be achieving a balance between the brute-force approach that naively attempts to include everything, and over simplification that throws out important heterogeneities at various levels. Central to this will be the recognition that individuals are the elementary particles of all ecological systems. As such it will be necessary to understand the effect of evolution on ecological systems, particularly when exposed to environmental change. However, insights from evolutionary biology will help the development of models even when data may be sparse. Process-based models are more common, and are used for forecasting, in other disciplines, e. g. climatology and molecular systems biology. Tools and techniques developed in these endeavours can be appropriated into ecological modelling, but it will also be necessary to develop the science of ecoinformatics along with approaches specific to ecological problems.

Much of this research has focused on phenology - the timing of life-history events. Phenology has well-demonstrated links to climate, from genetic to landscape scales; yet our ability to explain and predict variation in phenology across species, habitats and time remains poor. Here, we outline how merging approaches from ecology, climate science and evolutionary biology can advance research on phenological responses to climate variability. Using insight into seasonal and interannual climate variability combined with niche theory and community phylogenetics, we develop a predictive approach for species' reponses to changing climate. Our approach predicts that species occupying higher latitudes or the early growing season should be most sensitive to climate and have the most phylogenetically conserved phenologies. We further predict that temperate species will respond to climate change by shifting in time, while tropical species will respond by shifting space, or by evolving. Although we focus here on plant phenology, our approach is broadly applicable to ecological research of plant responses to climate variability.",,,,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012; Kraft, Nathan J.

IRI's forecasts have been based largely on a two-tiered multimodel dynamical prediction system. Forecasts of the 15% extremes have been consistent with the corresponding probabilistic forecasts for the standard tercile-based categories; however, nonclimatological forecasts for the extremes have been issued sparingly. Results indicate positive skill in terms of resolution and discrimination for the extremes forecasts, particularly in the tropics. Additionally, with the exception of some overconfidence for extreme above-normal precipitation and a strong cool bias for temperature, reliability analyses suggest generally good calibration. Skills for temperature are generally higher than those for precipitation, due both to correct forecasts of increased probabilities of extremely high (above the upper 15th percentile) temperatures associated with warming trends, and to better discrimination of interannual variability. However, above-normal temperature extremes were substantially underforecast, as noted also for the IRI's tercile forecasts.",,,,"Mason, Simon/AAH-5699-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WEATHER FORECAST,Weather Forecast.,AUG,2011,26,4,,,,,545,554,,10.1175/WAF-D-10-05009.1,,,,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,WOS:000294244200008,,,,,

Recently, data assimilation has been applied to improve these models for ecological forecasting. It is not clear what the relative information contributions of model (structure and parameters) vs. data are to constraints of short-and long-term forecasting. In this study, we assimilated eight sets of 10-year data (foliage, woody, and fine root biomass, litter fall, forest floor carbon [C], microbial C, soil C, and soil respiration) collected from Duke Forest into a Terrestrial Ecosystem model (TECO). The relative information contribution was measured by Shannon information index calculated from probability density functions (PDFs) of carbon pool sizes. The null knowledge without a model or data was defined by the uniform PDF within a prior range. The relative model contribution was information content in the PDF of modeled carbon pools minus that in the uniform PDF, while the relative data contribution was the information content in the PDF of modeled carbon pools after data was assimilated minus that before data assimilation. Our results showed that the information contribution of the model to constrain carbon dynamics increased with time whereas the data contribution declined. The eight data sets contributed more than the model to constrain C dynamics in foliage and fine root pools over the 100-year forecasts. The model, however, contributed more than the data sets to constrain the litter, fast soil organic matter (SOM), and passive SOM pools. For the two major C pools, woody biomass and slow SOM, the model contributed less information in the first few decades and then more in the following decades than the data. Knowledge of relative information contributions of model vs. data is useful for model development, uncertainty analysis, future data collection, and evaluation of ecological forecasting.",,,,"Weng, Ensheng/E-4390-2012","Weng, Ensheng/0000-0002-1858-4847",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

These forces include (1) dramatically increased volumes of data from observational and experimental networks, (2) increases in computational power, (3) advances in ecological models and related statistical and optimization methodologies, and most importantly, (4) societal needs to develop better strategies for natural resource management in a world of ongoing global change. Traditionally, ecological forecasting has been based on process-oriented models, informed by data in largely ad hoc ways. Although most ecological models incorporate some representation of mechanistic processes, today's models are generally not adequate to quantify real-world dynamics and provide reliable forecasts with accompanying estimates of uncertainty. A key tool to improve ecological forecasting and estimates of uncertainty is data assimilation (DA), which uses data to inform initial conditions and model parameters, thereby constraining a model during simulation to yield results that approximate reality as closely as possible. This paper discusses the meaning and history of DA in ecological research and highlights its role in refining inference and generating forecasts. DA can advance ecological forecasting by (1) improving estimates of model parameters and state variables, (2) facilitating selection of alternative model structures, and (3) quantifying uncertainties arising from observations, models, and their interactions. However, DA may not improve forecasts when ecological processes are not well understood or never observed. Overall, we suggest that DA is a key technique for converting raw data into ecologically meaningful products, which is especially important in this era of dramatically increased availability of data from observational and experimental networks.",,,,,"LaDeau, Shannon/0000-0003-4825-5435",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding.

The forecasting methods implemented in the competition are univariate and multivariate time series approaches, and econometric models. This forecasting competition differs from previous competitions in several ways: (i) we concentrate on tourism data only; (ii) we include approaches with explanatory variables; (iii) we evaluate the forecast interval coverage as well as the point forecast accuracy; (iv) we observe the effect of temporal aggregation on the forecasting accuracy; and (v) we consider the mean absolute scaled error as an alternative forecasting accuracy measure. We find that pure time series approaches provide more accurate forecasts for tourism data than models with explanatory variables. For seasonal data we implement three fully automated pure time series algorithms that generate accurate point forecasts, and two of these also produce forecast coverage probabilities which are satisfactorily close to the nominal rates. For annual data we find that Naive forecasts are hard to beat. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In eastern Australian waters, southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) are a quota-limited species in a multispecies longline fishery; minimizing capture by nonquota holders is an important management concern. A habitat preference model (conditioned with electronic tag data) coupled with ocean reanalysis data has been used since 2003 to generate real-time predicted maps of SBT distribution (nowcasts). These maps are used by fishery managers to restrict fisher access to areas with high predicted SBT distribution. Here we use the coupled ocean-atmosphere model, POAMA (predictive ocean atmosphere model for Australia), and a habitat model to forecast SBT distribution at lead times of up to 4 months. These forecasts are comparable with nowcasts derived from the operational system, and show skill in predicting SBT habitat boundaries out to lead-times of 3-4 months.

Both theoretical and empirical findings have indicated that integration of different models can be an effective way of improving upon their predictive performance, especially when the models in combination are quite different. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are flexible computing frameworks and universal approximators that can be applied to a wide range of forecasting problems with a high degree of accuracy. However, using ANNs to model linear problems have yielded mixed results, and hence; it is not wise to apply ANNs blindly to any type of data. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are one of the most popular linear models in time series forecasting, which have been widely applied in order to construct more accurate hybrid models during the past decade. Although, hybrid techniques, which decompose a time series into its linear and nonlinear components, have recently been shown to be successful for single models, these models have some disadvantages. In this paper, a novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA model is proposed in order to overcome mentioned limitation of ANNs and yield more general and more accurate forecasting model than traditional hybrid ARIMA-ANNs models. In our proposed model, the unique advantages of ARIMA models in linear modeling are used in order to identify and magnify the existing linear structure in data, and then a neural network is used in order to determine a model to capture the underlying data generating process and predict, using preprocessed data. Empirical results with three well-known real data sets indicate that the proposed model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by traditional hybrid models and also either of the components models used separately.

Models that accurately predict where new invasions will occur could guide the efficient allocation of resources to slow colonization. We assessed the accuracy of a model that predicts the probability of colonization of lakes in Wisconsin by Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). We based this predictive model on 9 years (1990-1999) of sequence data of milfoil colonization of lakes larger than 25 ha (n = 1803). We used milfoil colonization sequence data from 2000 to 2006 to test whether the model accurately predicted the number of lakes that actually were colonized from among the 200 lakes identified as being most likely to be colonized. We found that a lake's predicted probability of colonization was not correlated with whether a lake actually was colonized. Given the low predictability of colonization of specific lakes, we compared the efficacy of preventing milfoil from leaving occupied sites, which does not require predicting colonization probability, with protecting vacant sites from being colonized, which does require predicting colonization probability. Preventing organisms from leaving colonized sites reduced the likelihood of spread more than protecting vacant sites. Although we focused on the spread of a single species in a particular region, our results show the shortcomings of gravity models in predicting the spread of numerous non-native species to a variety of locations via a wide range of vectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Current phenological models, such as the commonly used temperature sum (thermal time) model, are efficient for predicting the timing of point events, e.g. the onset of flowering or leaf unfolding. However, the flowering period of boreal trees, including Betula pendula and B. pubescens, may last up to 5 weeks with widely varying flowering intensity. Therefore, the ability to predict the duration of the whole flowering period and the intensity of pollination is very important. In this paper, we present a new phenological model that predicts the whole flowering period and daily (normalized) variation of flowering intensity. The model is based on similar principles as the temperature sum model. The model was calibrated against pollen data recorded with pollen traps placed in several locations in Southern and Central Finland. Our new model predicted accurately the variation in the intensity throughout the flowering period. Moreover, it was able to predict the start and end of the pollination season with accuracy comparable to that achieved with an ordinary temperature sum model for point events. Due to limited amount of test data, the data-dependency of the model had to be tested with a bootstrapping approach. With this method, the model fit and parameter values showed to be independent of the parameter fitting data. The model can be used to predict the whole flowering period of wind-pollinated boreal trees for many different purposes, such as aerobiological forecasts of allergenic pollen, or generation of input data for models of long-range pollen transport.

In this study, we adopt a data-oriented approach in order to develop operational forecasting models (1-7 days ahead) of daily average airborne pollen concentrations of the highly allergenic taxa: Poaceae, Oleaceae and Urticaceae. The models are developed using a representative dataset consisting of pollen and meteorological time-series recorded during the years 1987-2002, in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The input variables (features) of the models have been optimized by making use of genetic algorithms, whereas we evaluate the performance of three algorithms: i) multi-Layer Perceptron, ii) support vector regression and iii) regression trees originating from distinct domains of Computational Intelligence (Cl), and compare the resulting models with traditional multiple linear regression models. Results show the superiority of Cl methods, especially when forecasting several days ahead, compared to traditional multiple linear regression models. Furthermore, the Cl models complement each other, resulting to a combined model that performs better than each one separately. The overall performance ranges, in terms of the index of agreement, from 0.85 to 0.93 clearly suggesting the potential operational use of the models.

Datasets on rare species distribution usually have few observations, limited spatial accuracy and lack of valid absences; conversely they provide comprehensive views of species distributions allowing to realistically capture most of their realized environmental niche. Rare species are the most in need of predictive distribution modelling but also the most difficult to model. We refer to this contrast as the ""rare species modelling paradox"" and propose as a solution developing modelling approaches that deal with a sufficiently large set of predictors, ensuring that statistical models are not over-fitted. Our novel approach fulfils this condition by fitting a large number of bivariate models and averaging them with a weighted ensemble approach. We further propose that this ensemble forecasting is conducted within a hierarchic multi-scale framework. We present two ensemble models for a test species, one at regional and one at local scale, each based on the combination of 630 models. In both cases, we obtained excellent spatial projections, unusual when modelling rare species. Model results highlight, from a statistically sound approach, the effects of multiple drivers in a same modelling framework and at two distinct scales. From this added information, regional models can support accurate forecasts of range dynamics under climate change scenarios, whereas local models allow the assessment of isolated or synergistic impacts of changes in multiple predictors.

Virtually all biological phenomena-from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes-have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.",,,,"Forrest, Jessica/A-6290-2010; Miller-Rushing, Abraham/D-5102-2009","Forrest, Jessica/0000-0002-5273-9339; Miller-Rushing, Abraham/0000-0003-3203-0143",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953-2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events.

We use a case study approach to demonstrate uncertainties in ecological predictions related to the driving climatic input data. We use observational records, derived observational datasets (e.g. interpolated observations from local weather stations and gridded data products) and output from general circulation models (GCM) in conjunction with site based phenology models to estimate the first flowering date (FFD) for three woody flowering species. Using derived observations over the modern time period, we find that cold biases and temperature trends lead to biased FFD simulations for all three species. Observational datasets resolved at the daily time step result in better FFD predictions compared to simulations using monthly resolution. Simulations using output from an ensemble of GCM and regional climate models over modern and future time periods have large intra-ensemble spreads and tend to underestimate observed FFD trends for the modern period. These results indicate that certain forcing datasets may be missing key features needed to generate accurate hindcasts at the local scale (e.g. trends, temporal resolution), and that standard modeling techniques (e.g. downscaling, ensemble mean, etc) may not necessarily improve the prediction of the ecological response. Studies attempting to simulate local ecological processes under modern and future climate forcing therefore need to quantify and propagate the climate data uncertainties in their simulations.",,,,"Steiner, Allison L/F-4942-2011; Steiner, Allison/AAC-7029-2020; Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012","Steiner, Allison L/0000-0002-3823-1512; Terando, Adam/0000-0002-9280-043X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

During the spin-up EnKF has to fulfill two independent requirements, namely that the ensemble mean be close to the true state, and that the ensemble perturbations represent the 'errors of the day'. As a result, there are cases, such as radar observations of a severe storm, or regional forecast of a hurricane, where EnKF may spin-up too slowly to be useful. A heuristic scheme is proposed to accelerate the spin-up of EnKF by applying a no-cost Ensemble Kalman Smoother, and using the observations more than once in each assimilation window during spin-up in order to maximize the initial extraction of information. The performance of this scheme is tested with the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) implemented in a quasi-geostrophic model, which requires a very long spin-up time when initialized from random initial perturbations from a uniform distribution. Results show that with the new 'running in place' (RIP) scheme the LETKF spins up and converges to the optimal level of error faster than 3D-Var or 4D-Var, even in the absence of any prior information. Additional computations (2 to 12 iterations for each assimilation window) are only required during the initial spin-up, since the scheme naturally returns to the original LETKF after spin-up is achieved. RIP also accelerates spin-up when the initial perturbations are drawn from a well-tuned 3D-Var background-error covariance, rather than being uniform noise, and fewer iterations and RIP cycles are required than in the case without such prior information.

We perform an economic analysis of these grazing strategies using a bio-economic multiperiod linear programming model with variable annual forage production and beef prices. We evaluate the economics of conservative versus flexible grazing where stock numbers are adjusted to match forage conditions. The deterministic model estimates that a flexible grazing strategy could nearly double net returns relative to a conservative strategy, but realizing this substantial economic potential means higher production costs, and it depends on a quality climate forecast that is not currently available. Maintaining grazing flexibility was determined to be very important for managing variable forage conditions, and its importance increased with the level of variability. Without annual variation in forage production, over 80% of available forage would optimally be allocated to cow calf production. As forage variability increased to levels observed on the arid rangelands of the western United States, a 50:50 forage allocation between cow calf and yearling enterprises was found to be optimal, but optimal cow numbers decreased over time as dry conditions force herd reductions. As compared to a cow calf ranch only, adding flexible yearling enterprises increased average annual net ranch returns by 14% with conservative stocking and by up to 66% with flexible grazing. Herd expansion beyond a conservative level should occur with yearlings because adjusting cow numbers is too expensive relative to the potential short-term gain, even if forage conditions are known with certainty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Methods Three approaches were considered: (1) incorporating models of species migration to understand the ability of a species to occupy suitable habitat in new locations; (2) linking models of landscape disturbance and succession to models of habitat suitability; and (3) fully linking models of habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and spatially explicit population dynamics. Results Linking species-environment relationships, landscape dynamics and population dynamics in a multi-modelling framework allows the combined impacts of climate change (affecting species distribution and vital rates) and land cover dynamics (land use change, altered disturbance regimes) on species to be predicted. This approach is only feasible if the life history parameters and habitat requirements of the species are well understood. Main conclusions Forecasts of the impacts of global change on species may be improved by considering multiple causes. A range of methods are available to address the interactions of changing habitat suitability, habitat dynamics and population response that vary in their complexity, realism and data requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

However, well-intentioned management plans may not meet this balance as most do not include the effect of climate change. Ocean temperatures are expected to increase through the 21st century, which will have far-reaching and complex impacts on marine fisheries. To begin to quantify these impacts for one coastal fishery along the cast coast of the United States, we develop a coupled climate population model for Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The model is based on a mechanistic hypothesis: recruitment is determined by temperature-driven, overwinter mortality of juveniles in their estuarine habitats. Temperature forecasts were obtained from 14 general circulation models simulating three CO2 emission scenarios. An ensemble-based approach was used in which a multimodel average was calculated for a given CO2 emission scenario to forecast the response of the population. The coupled model indicates that both exploitation and climate change significantly affect abundance and distribution of Atlantic croaker. At current levels of fishing, the average (2010-2100) spawning biomass of the population is forecast to increase by 60-100%. Similarly, the center of the population is forecast to shift 50-100 km northward. A yield analysis, which is used to calculate benchmarks for fishery management, indicates that the maximum sustainable yield will increase by 30-100%. Our results demonstrate that climate effects on fisheries must be identified, understood, and incorporated into the scientific advice provided to managers if sustainable exploitation is to be achieved in a changing climate.",,,,"Alexander, Michael A/A-7097-2013","Alexander, Michael A/0000-0001-9646-6427; Scott, James D/0000-0002-8709-8594",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Methods Species distribution models, which deliver habitat-based information on potential distributions, and interacting particle systems, which simulate spatio-temporal range dynamics as dependent on neighbourhood configurations, were combined into a common framework. We then used the combined model to simulate the invasion of A. artemisiifolia in Austria between 1990 and 2005. For comparison, simulations were also performed with models that accounted only for habitat suitability or neighbourhood configurations. The fit of the three models to the data was assessed by likelihood ratio tests, and simulated invasion patterns were evaluated against observed ones in terms of predictive discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I). Results The combined model fitted the data significantly better than the single-component alternatives. Simulations relying solely on parameterized spread kernels performed worst in terms of both AUC and spatial pattern formation. Simulations based only on habitat information correctly predicted infestation of susceptible areas but reproduced the autocorrelated patterns of A. artemisiifolia expansion less adequately than did the integrated model. Main conclusions Our integrated modelling approach offers a flexible tool for forecasts of spatio-temporal invasion patterns from landscape to regional scales. As a further advantage, scenarios of environmental change can be incorporated consistently by appropriately updating habitat suitability layers. Given the susceptibility of many alien plants, including A. artemisiifolia, to both land use and climate changes, taking such scenarios into account will increasingly become relevant for the design of proactive management strategies.",,,,,"Leitner, Michael/0000-0002-4975-6787; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We compared several statistical recruitment forecast models and demonstrate that an increasing abundance of predators on juvenile walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma, particularly the arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, which now dominates the groundfish biomass in the Gulf of Alaska, and autocorrelation caused by intercohort interactions strongly affect pollock recruitment during the juvenile phase. Furthermore, the weight of predictor variables changes with threshold criteria, which are linked to phase shifts in the marine environment.

Niche-based species distribution models offer a well-developed framework for assessing the potential range of species. However, these models assume equilibrium between the species' distribution and its ecological requirements. During range expansion, invasive species are not in such equilibrium due to both dispersal limitation and frequent casual occurrence in sites unsuitable to persistent populations. In this article we use the example of the invasive annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Austria to evaluate if model accuracy can be enhanced in such non-equilibrium situations by taking account of propagule pressure and by restricting model calibration to naturalized populations. Moreover, we test if model accuracy increases during invasion history using distribution data from 1984 to 2005. The results suggest that models calibrated with naturalized populations are much more accurate than those based on the total set of records. Proxies of propagule pressure slightly but significantly improve goodness of fit, accuracy, and Type I and II error rates of models calibrated with all available records but have less consistent effects on models of naturalized populations. Model accuracy did not increase during the recent invasion history, probably because the species is still far from an equilibrium distribution. We conclude that even a coarse assessment of population status with records of invasive species delivers important information for predictive modelling and that proxies of propagule pressure should be included into such models at least during early to intermediate stages of the invasion history.",,,,,"Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

In this paper, we review the history of applications of various model-data fusion techniques in studies of terrestrial carbon fluxes in two approaches: top-down approaches that use measurements of global CO2 concentration and sometimes other atmospheric constituents to infer carbon fluxes from the land surface, and bottom-up approaches that estimate carbon fluxes using process-based models. We consider applications of model-data fusion in flux estimation, parameter estimation, model error analysis, experimental design and forecasting. Significant progress has been made by systematically studying the discrepancies between the predictions by different models and observations. As a result, some major controversies in global carbon cycle studies have been resolved, robust estimates of continental and global carbon fluxes over the last two decades have been obtained, and major deficiencies in the atmospheric models for tracer transport have been identified. In the bottom-up approaches, various optimization techniques have been used for a range of process-based models. Model-data fusion techniques have been successfully used to improve model predictions, and quantify the information content of carbon flux measurements and identify what other measurements are needed to further constrain model predictions. However, we found that very few studies in both top-down and bottom-up approaches have quantified the errors in the observations, model parameters and model structure systematically and consistently. We therefore suggest that future research will focus on developing an integrated Bayesian framework to study both model and measurement errors systematically. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we present an analysis of the spring phenological response to climate variation of twelve taxa: six plants, three birds, a frog, and two insects. Phenology was monitored using standardized protocols at 176 meteorological stations in Japan and South Korea from 1953 to 2005, and in some cases even longer. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the complex interactions of temperature, site effects, and latitude on phenology. Results show species-specific variation in the magnitude and even in the direction of their responses to increasing temperature, which also differ from site-to-site. At most sites the differences in phenology among species are forecast to become greater with warmer temperatures. Our results challenge the assertion that trends in one geographic region can be extrapolated to others, and emphasize the idiosyncratic nature of the species response to global warming.

They also exhibit substantial variability among individuals in traits such as size, age, condition, and disease status that have large impacts on individual fates and consequently on the future of the population. We present here methods for constructing and analyzing a stochastic integral projection model (IPM) incorporating both of these forms of variability, illustrated through a case study of the monocarpic thistle Carlina vulgaris. We show how model construction can exploit the close correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of trait-fate relationships in a ""mixed"" or ""hierarchical"" models framework. This correspondence means that IPMs can be parameterized straightforwardly from data using established statistical techniques and software (vs. the largely ad hoc methods for stochastic matrix models), properly accounting for sampling error and between-year sample size variation and with vastly fewer parameters than a conventional stochastic matrix model. We show that the many tools available for analyzing stochastic matrix models (such as stochastic growth rate, lambda(S), small variance approximations, elasticity/sensitivity analysis, and life table response experiment [LTRE] analysis) can be used for IPMs, and we give computational formulas for elasticity/sensitivity analyses. We develop evolutionary analyses based on the connection between growth rate sensitivity and selection gradients and present a new method using techniques from functional data analysis to study the evolution of function-valued traits such as size-dependent flowering probability. For Carlina we found consistent selection against variability in both state-specific transition rates and the fitted functions describing state dependence in demographic rates. For most of the regression parameters de. ning the IPM there was also selection against temporal variance; however, in some cases the effects of nonlinear averaging were big enough to favor increased temporal variation. The LTRE analysis identified year-to-year variation in survival as the dominant factor in population growth variability. Evolutionary analysis of flowering strategy showed that the entire functional relationship between plant size and flowering probability is at or near an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) shaped by the size-specific trade-off between the benefit (fecundity) and cost (mortality) of flowering in a temporally varying environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The driving force for these epidemics is a combination of biotic (vector, amplification host, and virus) and abiotic (meteorological conditions, especially rainfall and temperature) factors. Abiotic factors that facilitate the synchronization and interaction of vector and amplification host populations favor epidemic amplification and transmission. In Florida, epidemics of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, SLEV) have been preceded by major freezes one or two winters before the onset of human cases. Here, we analyze the relationship between severe winter freezes and epidemic SLEV transmission in peninsular Florida and show that there is a significant relationship between the transmission of SLEV and these severe freezes. We propose that by killing cold-sensitive understory vegetation in the mid-peninsular region of Florida, freezes enhance the reproductive success of ground-feeding avian amplification hosts, especially mourning doves and common grackles. In conjunction with other appropriate environmental signals, increased avian reproductive success may enhance SLEV and West Nile (WN) virus amplification and result in SLE and WN epidemics during years when all of the biological cycles are properly synchronized. The knowledge that winter freezes in Florida may enhance the amplification and epidemic transmission of SLE and WN viruses facilitates arboviral tracking and prediction of human risk of SLE and WN infection during the transmission season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

This paper compares the following different weighting methods with or without taking into account the single-model performance: equal weighting of models (EW), simple skill-based weighting (SW), using a simple model performance indicator, and weighting by Bayesian model averaging ( BMA). These methods are tested for both short-range weather and seasonal temperature forecasts. The prototype seasonal multimodel ensemble is the Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble System for Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction (DEMETER) system, with four different models and nine forecasts per model. The short-range multimodel prototype system is the European Meteorological Services (EUMETNET) Poor-Man's Ensemble Prediction System (PEPS), with 14 models and one forecast per model. It is shown that despite the different forecast ranges and spatial scales, the impact of weighting is comparable for both forecast systems and is related to the same ensemble characteristics. In both cases the added value of ensemble forecasting over single-model forecasting increases considerably with the decreasing correlation of the models' forecast errors, with a relation depending only on the number of models. Also, in both cases a larger spread in model performance increases the added value of combining model forecasts using the performance-based SW or BMA weighting instead of EW. Finally, the more complex BMA weighting adds value over SW only if the best model performs better than the ensemble with EW weighting.",,,,"Ahrens, Bodo/A-7439-2008","Ahrens, Bodo/0000-0002-6452-3180",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Quantifying LDD is thus important for predicting the future dynamics of plants exposed to environmental changes. However, environmental changes can also alter the behaviour of LDD vectors: for instance, increasing air temperature may enhance atmospheric instability, thereby altering the turbulent airflow that transports seed and pollen. Here, we investigate temperature effects on wind dispersal in a boreal forest using a 10-year time series of micrometeorological measurements and a Lagrangian stochastic model for particle transport. For a wide range of dispersal and life history types, we found positive relations between air temperature and LDD. This translates into a largely consistent positive effect of +3 degrees C warming on predicted LDD frequencies and spread rates of plants. Relative increases in LDD frequency tend to be higher for heavy-seeded plants, whereas absolute increases in LDD and spread rates are higher for light-seeded plants for which wind is often an important dispersal vector. While these predicted increases are not sufficient to compensate forecasted range losses and environmental changes can alter plant spread in various ways, our results generally suggest that warming can promote wind-driven movements of plant genotypes and populations in boreal forests.",,,,"Katul, Gabriel G/A-7210-2008; Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008","Katul, Gabriel G/0000-0001-9768-3693; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In 11 sites encompassing a wide range of conditions and vegetation physiognomies, we studied a 20-year monthly data set of NDVI and precipitation. We took into account the precipitation of current, as well as previous periods of variable length. Interannual variation of annual NDVI was little correlated with annual precipitation, either current or previous. In contrast, it was highly and widely correlated with precipitation accumulated during a few months of the previous growing season. Interannual variation of seasonal NDVI was little correlated With Current seasonal precipitation. In contrast, it was significantly correlated with precipitation accumulated during previous periods of variable length according to the season and site under consideration. NDVI was more tightly coupled with precipitation in drier ecosystems. Lags of response between NDVI and precipitation provide an opportunity for forecasting ANPP and suggest even longer lags between climatic variation and herbivore performance.

Depending on the rate of climatic change, the landscape fragmentation and the dispersal capabilities of individual species, these assumptions are likely to prove inaccurate, leading to under-or overestimation of future species distributions and yielding large uncertainty between these two extremes. As a result, the concepts of 'potentially suitable' and 'potentially colonizable' habitat are expected to differ significantly. To quantify to what extent these two concepts can differ, we developed MIGCLIM, a model simulating plant dispersal under climate change and landscape fragmentation scenarios. MIGCLIM implements various parameters, such as dispersal distance, increase in reproductive potential over time, landscape fragmentation or long-distance dispersal. Location Western Swiss Alps. Methods Using our MIGCLIM model, several simulations were run for two virtual species by varying dispersal distance and other parameters. Each simulation covered the 100-year period 2001-2100 and three different IPCC-based temperature warming scenarios were considered. Results of dispersal-limited projections were compared with unlimited and no-dispersal projections. Results Our simulations indicate that: (1) using realistic parameter values, the future potential distributions generated using MIGCLIM can differ significantly (up to more than 95% difference in colonized surface) from those that ignore dispersal; (2) this divergence increases under more extreme climate warming scenarios and over longer time periods; and (3) the uncertainty associated with the warming scenario can be as large as the one related to dispersal parameters.

The aerobiological monitoring was carried out in 1997-2005 and 2007 in Rzeszw (SE Poland). In the presented investigation, three methods defining the start of the Quercus pollen season were selected on the basis of accumulated sums of pollen or the constant occurrence of pollen grains in air. Despite the application of different combinations of GDDA degrees C methods and threshold temperatures, the correlation coefficients between the expected and obtained values were low. In some cases, however, they proved highly effective for the test years (2005, 2007) with the accuracy of a few days. For GDDA degrees C methods, the best threshold temperatures range between 5 and 6A degrees C. Models based on bioclimatic indices and meteorological variables were not satisfactory.

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be con. dent in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples ( both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie.

The HABs, caused by the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, lead to shellfish toxicity and to respiratory irritation. In addition to predicting new blooms and their extent, HAB forecasts are made twice weekly during a bloom event, using a combination of satellite derived image products, wind predictions, and a rule-based model derived from previous observations and research. These forecasts include: identification, intensification, transport, extent, and impact; the latter being the most significant to the public. Identification involves identifying new blooms as HABs and is validated against an operational monitoring program involving water sampling. Intensification forecasts, which are much less frequently made, can only be evaluated with satellite data on mono-specific blooms. Extent and transport forecasts of HABs are also evaluated against the water samples. Due to the resolution of the forecasts and available validation data, skill cannot be resolved at scales finer than 30 km. Initially, respiratory irritation forecasts were analyzed using anecdotal information, the only available data, which had a bias toward major respiratory events leading to a forecast accuracy exceeding 90%. When a systematic program of twice-daily observations from lifeguards was implemented, the forecast could be meaningfully assessed. The results show that the forecasts identify the occurrence of respiratory events at all lifeguard beaches 70% of the time. However, a high rate (80%) of false positive forecasts occurred at any given beach. As the forecasts were made at half to whole county level, the resolution of the validation data was reduced to county level, reducing false positives to 22% (accuracy of 78%). The study indicates the importance of systematic sampling, even when using qualitative descriptors, the use of validation resolution to evaluate forecast capabilities, and the need to match forecast and validation resolutions.

Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) is projected to shrink as concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) increase, and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) are extremely sensitive to these changes because they use sea ice as a breeding, foraging and molting habitat. We project emperor penguin population responses to future sea ice changes, using a stochastic population model that combines a unique long-term demographic dataset (1962-2005) from a colony in Terre Adelie, Antarctica and projections of SIE from General Circulation Models (GCM) of Earth's climate included in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We show that the increased frequency of warm events associated with projected decreases in SIE will reduce the population viability. The probability of quasi-extinction (a decline of 95% or more) is at least 36% by 2100. The median population size is projected to decline from approximate to 6,000 to approximate to 400 breeding pairs over this period. To avoid extinction, emperor penguins will have to adapt, migrate or change the timing of their growth stages.

Predicting spread of non-indigenous species requires an understanding of where propagules are being transported, and whether these propagules can survive in the novel habitat and successfully integrate into the recipient community. In this study, we model potential spread of invading Cabomba caroliniana in Ontario, Canada, using a combination of passive and active dispersal models coupled with an environmental suitability model, thereby considering the first two stages of the invasion process. 2. Measures of propagule pressure incorporated both human-mediated dispersal via trailered boats, and advective flow from invaded to non-invaded systems, while habitat suitability was forecasted by combining native and global data sets and using boosted regression trees. 3. Risk of invasion differed depending on the combination of approaches used and the time period considered. Three lakes appear to be at greatest risk owing to a combination of high boater and water movement from invaded sources, and high environmental suitability. The best predictors of lake suitability were pH, mean lake temperature and dissolved calcium concentration.

Catches for these species represented approximately 55% of the total fish catch in the North Pacific in the 1990s. Five distinct groups were apparent in the data, and each group exhibited a different response to the climate regime shifts of 1977, 1989, and 1998. Some species appeared to have responded only to the regime shift in 1977, others responded only to the shift in 1989, and a few species responded to both. The trends in the time series of catches for these five groups were not random, and shifts in catch generally coincided with regime shifts as identified by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and other indices of climate change. Although this study examined the relationship of fisheries to trends in climate, there is an obvious linkage to the population dynamics of a particular species.

Prior to the onset of a shell disease epizootic in 1997, larval settlement alone fully explained 82% of the variation in the numbers of pre-recruit lobsters about to enter the Rhode Island lobster fishery. With the onset of shell disease, however, the model required an additional term for disease prevalence to provide a sufficient statistical fit to the observed data. Neither time trends in bottom temperature nor predatory fish provided significant additional explanatory power for variability in pre-recruit abundance. To our knowledge, this analysis constitutes the first demonstration in which cohorts of a benthic marine invertebrate have been successfully tracked from settlement to the threshold of a fishery by accounting for the joint effects of variable supply of new recruits and subsequent disease during post-settlement years. As such, it illustrates how factors altering the rate of post-settlement mortality over time can obscure predictive relationships between settlement and subsequent recruitment. A tight spawner-to-recruit linkage is therefore unlikely in coastal Rhode Island. The analysis underscores the value of maintaining parallel time series of different life stages, as well as the need to better quantify both pre- and post-settlement mechanisms that influence cohort success in marine populations.",,,,"Wahle, Richard/AAI-3047-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The 'safe' livestock carrying capacity (LCC) required to maintain resource condition is strongly dependent on climate. We reviewed: the approaches for quantifying LCC; current trends in climate and their effect on components of the grazing system; implications of the 'best estimates' of climate change projections for LCC; the agreement and disagreement between the current trends and projections; and the adequacy of current models of forage production in simulating the impact of climate change. We report the results of a sensitivity study of climate change impacts on forage production across the rangelands, and we discuss the more general issues facing grazing enterprises associated with climate change, such as 'known uncertainties' and adaptation responses (e.g. use of climate risk assessment). We found that the method of quantifying LCC from a combination of estimates (simulations) of long-term (>30 years) forage production and successful grazier experience has been well tested across northern Australian rangelands with different climatic regions. This methodology provides a sound base for the assessment of climate change impacts, even though there are many identified gaps in knowledge. The evaluation of current trends indicated substantial differences in the trends of annual rainfall (and simulated forage production) across Australian rangelands with general increases in most of western Australian rangelands ( including northern regions of the Northern Territory) and decreases in eastern Australian rangelands and south-western Western Australia. Some of the projected changes in rainfall and temperature appear small compared with year-to-year variability. Nevertheless, the impacts on rangeland production systems are expected to be important in terms of required managerial and enterprise adaptations. Some important aspects of climate systems science remain unresolved, and we suggest that a risk-averse approach to rangeland management, based on the 'best estimate' projections, in combination with appropriate responses to short-term (1-5 years) climate variability, would reduce the risk of resource degradation. Climate change projections - including changes in rainfall, temperature, carbon dioxide and other climatic variables - if realised, are likely to affect forage and animal production, and ecosystem functioning. The major known uncertainties in quantifying climate change impacts are: (i) carbon dioxide effects on forage production, quality, nutrient cycling and competition between life forms (e.g. grass, shrubs and trees); and (ii) the future role of woody plants including effects of. re, climatic extremes and management for carbon storage. In a simple example of simulating climate change impacts on forage production, we found that increased temperature (3 degrees C) was likely to result in a decrease in forage production for most rangeland locations (e. g. -21% calculated as an unweighted average across 90 locations). The increase in temperature exacerbated or reduced the effects of a 10% decrease/increase in rainfall respectively (-33% or -9%). Estimates of the beneficial effects of increased CO2 (from 350 to 650 ppm) on forage production and water use efficiency indicated enhanced forage production (+26%). The increase was approximately equivalent to the decline in forage production associated with a 3 degrees C temperature increase. The large magnitude of these opposing effects emphasised the importance of the uncertainties in quantifying the impacts of these components of climate change. We anticipate decreases in LCC given that the 'best estimate' of climate change across the rangelands is for a decline (or little change) in rainfall and an increase in temperature. As a consequence, we suggest that public policy have regard for: the implications for livestock enterprises, regional communities, potential resource damage, animal welfare and human distress. However, the capability to quantify these warnings is yet to be developed and this important task remains as a challenge for rangeland and climate systems science.",,,,"Syktus, Jozef/E-7173-2011; Stokes, Chris/G-5199-2010; Crimp, Steven/D-6995-2011; Howden, Stuart M/C-1138-2008","Syktus, Jozef/0000-0003-1782-3073; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457; Crimp, Steven/0000-0003-4068-573X; Howden, Stuart M/0000-0002-0386-9671",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2009,31,1,,,,,1,29,,10.1071/RJ08068,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000264639900002,,,,,

They have been shown to respond strongly to many of the drivers that are predicted to change natural systems over this century, including climate, introduced species, and other anthropogenic influences. Predicting how different tree species might respond to this complex of forces remains a daunting challenge for forest ecologists. Yet shifts in species composition and abundance can radically influence hydrological and atmospheric systems, plant and animal ranges, and human populations, making this challenge an important one to address. Forest ecologists have gathered a great deal of data over the past decades and are now using novel quantitative and computational tools to translate those data into predictions about the fate of forests. Here, after a brief review of the threats to forests over the next century, one of the more promising approaches to making ecological predictions is described: using hierarchical Bayesian methods to model forest demography and simulating future forests from those models. This approach captures complex processes, such as seed dispersal and mortality, and incorporates uncertainty due to unknown mechanisms, data problems, and parameter uncertainty. After describing the approach, an example by simulating drought for a southeastern forest is offered. Finally, there is a discussion of how this approach and others need to be cast within a framework of prediction that strives to answer the important questions posed to environmental scientists, but does so with a respect for the challenges inherent in predicting the future of a complex biological system.",,,,"Clark, James S./G-6331-2011; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; Hersh, Michelle/D-2079-2009","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; Hersh, Michelle/0000-0003-1174-7575; Moran, Emily/0000-0003-4624-1910",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2009,1162,,,,,,221,236,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04495.x,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000266235600009,,,,,

Mixotrophy, the use of phototrophy and heterotrophy in combination, has been emphasized as operative mainly in nutrient-poor habitats as a mechanism for augmenting nutrient supplies. Here we examine an alternate premise, that many harmful algae which thrive in eutrophic habitats are mixotrophs that respond both directly to nutrient inputs, and indirectly through high abundance of bacterial and algal prey that are stimulated by the elevated nutrients. From review and synthesis of the available data, mixotrophy occurs in all HAS examined thus far in the organic substrate- and prey-rich habitats of eutrophic estuarine and marine coastal waters. Where data are available comparing phototrophy versus mixotrophy, mixotrophy in eutrophic habitats generally is significant in nutrient acquisition and growth of HAS and, therefore, likely important in the development and maintenance of their blooms. In eutrophic habitats phagotrophic mixotrophs, in particular, have been shown to attain higher growth than when in phototrophic mode. Yet for many HAS, quantitative data about the role of mixotrophy in nutrition, growth, and blooms are lacking, especially relating laboratory information to natural field assemblages, so that the relative importance of photosynthesis, dissolved organic nutrients, and ingestion of prey largely remain unknown. Research is needed to assess simultaneously the roles of phototrophy, osmotrophy and phagotrophy in the nutritional ecology of HAS in eutrophic habitats, spanning bloom initiation, development and senescence. From these data, models that include the role of mixotrophy can be developed to gain more realistic insights about the nutritional factors that control harmful algae in eutrophic waters, and to strengthen predictive capability in predicting their blooms. An overall forecast that can be tested, as well, is that harmful mixotrophic algae will become more abundant as their food supplies increase in many estuaries and coastal waters that are sustaining chronic, increasing cultural eutrophication.

Nonetheless, they are also controlled by other physical factors that may prevent them moving to new thermally suitable sites. Using presence-absence records in 655 sites widespread throughout nine French river units, we predicted the potential future distribution of 30 common stream fish species facing temperature warming and change in precipitation regime. We also assessed the potential impacts on fish assemblages' structure and diversity. Only cold-water species, whose diversity is very low in French streams, were predicted to experience a strong reduction in the number of suitable sites. In contrast, most cool-water and warm-water fish species were projected to colonize many newly suitable sites. Considering that cold headwater streams are the most numerous on the Earth's surface, our results suggested that headwater species would undergo a deleterious effect of climate change, whereas downstream species would expand their range by migrating to sites located in intermediate streams or upstream.

Changes in assemblage composition were also positively related to the intensity of warming.

S. due to putative climatic suitability. Additionally, projected trends of global warming were predicted to significantly increase suitable habitat and promote range expansion by these snakes. However, the ecological limitations of the Burmese python are not known and the possible effects of global warming on the potential expansion of the species are also unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that a predicted continental expansion is unlikely based on the ecology of the organism and the climate of the U. S. Our ecological niche models, which include variables representing climatic extremes as well as averages, indicate that the only suitable habitat in the U. S. for Burmese pythons presently occurs in southern Florida and in extreme southern Texas. Models based on the current distribution of the snake predict suitable habitat in essentially the only region in which the snakes are found in the U. S. Future climate models based on global warming forecasts actually indicate a significant contraction in suitable habitat for Burmese pythons in the U. S. as well as in their native range. Conclusions/Significance: The Burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the United States it currently inhabits due to the ecological niche preferences of the snake. The ability of the Burmese python to expand further into the U. S. is severely limited by ecological constraints. Global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide, underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species.",,,,"Pyron, Robert/F-1681-2014","Pyron, Robert/0000-0003-2524-1794",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,13-Aug,2008,3,8,,,,,,,e2931,10.1371/journal.pone.0002931,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,WOS:000264412600017,,,,,

Range-shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction, often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data, but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species, the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia, assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move, survive, and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally, by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism, trait-based approaches can be used to investigate the range-limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species' potential to evolve at range-edges.

We argue here that dispersal kernels are in fact highly dynamic during periods of range advance because density effects and spatial assortment by dispersal ability (""spatial selection"") drive the evolution of increased dispersal on the expanding front. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we demonstrate this effect under a wide variety of population growth rates and dispersal costs. We then test the possibility of an evolved shift in dispersal kernels by measuring dispersal rates in individual cane toads (Bufo marinus) from invasive populations in Australia (historically, toads advanced their range at 10 km/year, but now they achieve 155 km/year in the northern part of their range). Under a common-garden design, we found a steady increase in dispersal tendency with distance from the invasion origin. Dispersal kernels on the invading front were less kurtotic and less skewed than those from origin populations. Thus, toads have increased their rate of range expansion partly through increased dispersal on the expanding front. For accurate long-range forecasts of range advance, we need to take into account the potential for dispersal kernels to be evolutionarily dynamic.",,,,"Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008; Phillips, Ben/C-7957-2009; Travis, Justin/B-8571-2014; Brown, Gregory P./F-9897-2011","Phillips, Ben/0000-0003-2580-2336; Travis, Justin/0000-0002-5785-4272; Brown, Gregory P./0000-0002-2924-9040",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AM NAT,Am.

In many regions, aquatic invasive species have established isolated populations, but have not yet spread to many sites that provide suitable habitat. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, several Great Lakes invaders such as zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) are currently undergoing secondary spread to the smaller inland lakes and streams. This paper describes recent advances in forecasting the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species and presents a framework for assessing vulnerability of inland waters based on explicit assessment of three distinct aspects of biological invasions: colonization, site suitability, and adverse impact. In many cases, only a fraction of lakes on the landscape are vulnerable to specific invasive species, highlighting the potential application of this type of research for improving invasive species management. Effective application to on-the-ground resource management will require that research aimed at assessing site vulnerability be translated into management tools.",,,,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Given the impact that meteorological conditions have on air quality simulations, it has been assumed that the resultant air quality simulations would be more skillful by using dynamic analyses rather than meteorological forecasts to characterize the meteorological conditions, and that the statistical trends in the meteorological model fields are also reflected in the air quality model. This article, which is the first of two parts, demonstrates the impact of nudging in the meteorological model on retrospective air quality model simulations. Here, meteorological simulations are generated by the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) using both the traditional dynamic analysis approach and using forecasts for a summertime period. The resultant fields are then used to characterize the meteorological conditions for emissions processing and air quality simulations using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modeling System. As expected, on average, the near-surface meteorological fields show a significant degradation over time in the forecasts ( when nudging is not used), while the dynamic analyses maintain nearly constant statistical scores in time. The use of nudged MM5 fields in CMAQ generally results in better skill scores for daily maximum 1-h ozone mixing ratio simulations. On average, the skill of the daily maximum 1-h ozone simulation deteriorates significantly over time when nonnudged MM5 fields are used in CMAQ. The daily maximum 1-h ozone mixing ratio also degrades over time in the CMAQ simulation that uses MM5 dynamic analyses, although to a much lesser degree, despite no aggregate loss of skill over time in the dynamic analyses themselves. These results affirm the advantage of using nudging in MM5 to create the meteorological characterization for CMAQ for retrospective simulations, and it is shown that MM5-based dynamic analyses are robust at the surface throughout 5.5-day simulations.",,,,,"Spero, Tanya/0000-0002-1600-0422",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

A combination of bottom-up and top-down eutrophication control measures has been implemented in both lakes since 1979. Dividing the time-series data into training and validation datasets based on three distinctive management periods has facilitated a comparative analysis of the two lakes regarding the long-term dynamics in response to eutrophication control. Results of the study have demonstrated that RANN and HEA can be applied for (1) 5-day-ahead prediction of Oscillatoria spp. and (2) 5-day-ahead prediction of Scenedesmus spp. Firstly RANN achieved reasonably accurate results for 5-day-ahead forecasting of abundances of blue-green algae Oscillatoria and green algae Scenedesmus in both lakes. Secondly HEA achieved similar good forecasting results and also provided model representations for both algae species in the form of rule sets. The limitation with single lake models is that the rule sets discovered are lake specific. Merging of the two lake datasets using merged lake models for both training and testing have produced simpler and generic rule sets that explain the dynamics of Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus for both lakes. The results from this study have shown that both external nutrient control combined with food web manipulation have turned the lakes from hypereutrophic conditions and from Oscillatoria to Scenedesmus dominance. These complex dynamics that are associated with the shift from periods of turbid with Oscillatoria dominance to clear-water conditions with increased Scenedesmus in both lakes are predictable and can be explained by the key-driving variables in the generic rule sets discovered.

In this work, we propose a simple modification to the traditional EnKF that results in matching the analysed error covariance given by Kalman filter in cases when the correction is small; without perturbed observations. The proposed filter is based on the recognition that in the case of small corrections to the forecast the traditional EnKF without perturbed observations reduces the forecast error covariance by an amount that is nearly twice as large as that is needed to match Kalman filter. The analysis scheme works as follows: update the ensemble mean and the ensemble anomalies separately; update the mean using the standard analysis equation; update the anomalies with the same equation but half the Kalman gain. The proposed filter is shown to be a linear approximation to the ensemble square root filter (ESRF). Because of its deterministic character and its similarity to the traditional EnKF we call it the 'deterministic EnKF', or the DEnKF. A number of numerical experiments to compare the performance of the DEnKF with both the EnKF and an ESRF using three small models are conducted. We show that the DEnKF performs almost as well as the ESRF and is a significant improvement over the EnKF. Therefore, the DEnKF combines the numerical effectiveness, simplicity and versatility of the EnKF with the performance of the ESRFs. Importantly, the DEnKF readily permits the use of the traditional Schur product-based localization schemes.",,,,"Oke, Peter R/C-5127-2011; Sakov, Pavel/A-1578-2008","Oke, Peter R/0000-0002-3163-5610; Sakov, Pavel/0000-0003-3040-0980",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15 - 30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos.

The goals of GODAE include the development and application of eddy-resolving, data assimilating ocean forecast systems. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the Bluelink effort that are motivated by this goal. One of the main innovations of Bluelink is the development of the Bluelink ocean data assimilation system (BODAS). The initial test-bed for BODAS is the Bluelink ReANalysis (BRAN), a multi-year model integration with data assimilation. The Bluelink model is a global ocean general circulation model that is eddy-resolving in the Australian region. Observations that are assimilated into BRAN include satellite altimetry, sea-surface temperature and in situ temperature and salinity data from Argo, XBT, TAO and other sources. BODAS is an ensemble optimal interpolation system that uses an ensemble of intraseasonal anomalies from a free running model to estimate the background error covariances (BECs). The ensemble-based BECs are multivariate and inhomogeneous and are shown to reflect the length-scales, the anisotropy and the covariability of mesoscale oceanic processes. We evaluate the performance. of BODAS and BRAN (version 1.5), spanning the period January 2003 to June 2006, by comparing reanalyzed fields to a range of satellite-derived and in situ observations. Specifically, we demonstrate that BRAN realistically reproduces the mesoscale circulation around Australia, representing both the broad-scale circulation and, in many instances, the relatively small-scale mesoscale features. Quantitatively, we show that reanalyzed fields in the region around Australia are typically within 6-12 cm of withheld altimetric observations, within 0.5-0.9 degrees of observed sea-surface temperature and within 4-7 cm of observed coastal sea-level. Comparisons with Argo profiles and surface drifting buoys show that BRAN fields are within 1 degrees of observed sub-surface temperature, within 0.15 psu of observed sub-surface salinity and within 0.2 m s(-1) of near-surface currents.

Drought and high temperature are especially considered as key stress factors with high potential impact on crop yield. Yield safety can only be improved if future breeding attempts will be based on the valuable new knowledge acquired on the processes determining plant development and its responses to stress. Plant stress responses are very complex. Interactions between plant structure, function and the environment need to be investigated at various phases of plant development at the organismal, cellular as well as molecular levels in order to obtain a full picture. The results achieved so far in this field indicate that various plant organs, in a definite hierarchy and in interaction with each other, are involved in determining crop yield under stress.

In this paper, we argue that accurate forecasting of a population's quasi-extinction risk does not necessarily require knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms. Because of the stochastic and multiplicative nature of population growth, the ensemble behaviour of population trajectories converges to common statistical forms across a wide variety of stochastic population processes. This paper provides a theoretical basis for this argument. We show that the quasi-extinction surfaces of a variety of complex stochastic population processes (including age-structured, density-dependent and spatially structured populations) can be modelled by a simple stochastic approximation: the stochastic exponential growth process overlaid with Gaussian errors. Using simulated and real data, we show that this model can be estimated with 20-30 years of data and can provide relatively unbiased quasi-extinction risk with confidence intervals considerably smaller than (0,1). This was found to be true even for simulated data derived from some of the noisiest population processes (density-dependent feedback, species interactions and strong age-structure cycling). A key advantage of statistical models is that their parameters and the uncertainty of those parameters can be estimated from time series data using standard statistical methods. In contrast for most species of conservation concern, biologically realistic models must often be specified rather than estimated because of the limited data available for all the various parameters. Biologically realistic models will always have a prominent place in PVA for evaluating specific management options which affect a single segment of a population, a single demographic rate, or different geographic areas. However, for forecasting quasi-extinction risk, statistical models that are based on the convergent statistical properties of population processes offer many advantages over biologically realistic models.",,,,"Sabo, John/B-1872-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

These are explored in the context of nowcasting and forecasting using nonlinear differential equation based marine ecosystem models assimilating sparse and noisy non-Gaussian multivatiate observations. The statistical framework uses a state space model with the goal of estimating the time evolving probability distribution of the ecosystem state. Assimilation of observations relies on stochastic dynamic prediction and Bayesian principles. In this study, a new sequential data assimilation approach is introduced based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The ecosystem state is represented by an ensemble, or sample, from which distributional properties, or summary statistical measures, can be derived. The Metropolis-Hastings based MCMC approach is compared and contrasted with two other sequential data assimilation approaches: sequential importance resampling, and the (approximate) ensemble Kalman filter (including computational comparisons). A simple illustrative application is provided based on a 0-D nonlinear plank-ton ecosystem model with multivariate non-Gaussian observations of the ecosystem state from a coastal ocean observatory. The MCMC approach is shown to be straightforward to implement and to effectively characterize the non-Gaussian ecosystem state in both nowcast and forecast experiments. Results are reported which illustrate how non-Gaussian information originates, and how it can be used to characterize ecosystem properties. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Autocorrelation (AC) and partial autocorrelation (PAC) functions were estimated, which led to the identification and construction of seasonal ARIMA models, suitable in explaining the time series and forecasting the future catch per unit of effort (CPUE) values. Univariate and multivariate ARIMA models satisfactorily predicted the total pelagic fish production and the production of anchovy, sardine, and horse mackerel. The univariate ARIMA models demonstrated a good performance in terms of explained variability and predicting power. The current findings revealed a strong autoregressive character providing relatively high R-2 and satisfactory forecasts that were close to the recorded CPUE values. The present results also indicated that the multivariate ARIMA outperformed the univariate ARIMA models in terms of fitting accuracy. The opposite was evidenced when testing the forecasting accuracy of the two methods, where the univariate ARIMA models overall performed better than the multivariate models. The observed seasonal pattern in the monthly production series was attributed to the intrinsic nature of the pelagic fishery.

An ecological model was developed using genetic programming (GP) to predict the time-series dynamics of the diatom, Stephanodiscus hantzschii for the lower Nakdong River, South Korea. Eight years of weekly data showed the river to be hypertrophic (chl. a, 45.1 +/- 4.19 mu g L-1, mean +/- SE, n = 427), and S. hantzschii annually formed blooms during the winter to spring flow period (late November to March). 2. A simple non-linear equation was created to produce a 3-day sequential forecast of the species biovolume, by means of time series optimization genetic programming (TSOGP). Training data were used in conjunction with a GP algorithm utilizing 7 years of limnological variables (1995-2001). The model was validated by comparing its output with measurements for a specific year with severe blooms (1994). The model accurately predicted timing of the blooms although it slightly underestimated biovolume (training r(2) = 0.70, test r(2) = 0.78). The model consisted of the following variables: dam discharge and storage, water temperature, Secchi transparency, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, evaporation and silica concentration. 3. The application of a five-way cross-validation test suggested that GP was capable of developing models whose input variables were similar, although the data are randomly used for training. The similarity of input variable selection was approximately 51% between the best model and the top 20 candidate models out of 150 in total (based on both Root Mean Squared Error and the determination coefficients for the test data). 4. Genetic programming was able to determine the ecological importance of different environmental variables affecting the diatoms. A series of sensitivity analyses showed that water temperature was the most sensitive parameter. In addition, the optimal equation was sensitive to DO, Secchi transparency, dam discharge and silica concentration. The analyses thus identified likely causes of the proliferation of diatoms in 'river-reservoir hybrids' (i.e. rivers which have the characteristics of a reservoir during the dry season). This result provides specific information about the bloom of S. hantzschii in river systems, as well as the applicability of inductive methods, such as evolutionary computation to river-reservoir hybrid systems.",,,,"Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/O-6355-2014","Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/0000-0001-7721-4937",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The assimilation provides a self-consistent, temporally continuous estimate of the coupled model state and its uncertainty, in the form of discrete ensemble members, which can be used directly to initialize probabilistic climate forecasts. Here, the CDA is evaluated using a series of perfect model experiments, in which a particular twentieth-century simulation-with temporally varying greenhouse gas and natural aerosol radiative forcings-serves as a ""truth"" from which observations are drawn, according to the actual ocean observing network for the twentieth century. These observations are then assimilated into a coupled model ensemble that is subjected only to preindustrial forcings. By examining how well this analysis ensemble reproduces the ""truth,"" the skill of the analysis system in recovering anthropogenically forced trends and natural climate variability is assessed, given the historical observing network. The assimilation successfully reconstructs the twentieth-century ocean heat content variability and trends in most locations. The experiments highlight the importance of maintaining key physical relationships among model fields, which are associated with water masses in the ocean and geostrophy in the atmosphere. For example, when only oceanic temperatures are assimilated, the ocean analysis is greatly improved by incorporating the temperature-salinity covariance provided by the analysis ensemble. Interestingly, wind observations are more helpful than atmospheric temperature observations for constructing the structure of the tropical atmosphere; the opposite holds for the extratropical atmosphere. The experiments indicate that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is difficult to constrain using the twentieth-century observational network, but there is hope that additional observations-including those from the newly deployed Argo profiles-may lessen this problem in the twenty-first century. The challenges for data assimilation of model systematic biases and evolving observing systems are discussed.",,,,"Wittenberg, Andrew T/G-9619-2013","Wittenberg, Andrew T/0000-0003-1680-8963",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

The intermediate coupled model used here is the operational version of the Zebiak-Cane model, called LDEO5. The assimilation is applied as a means of estimating the true state of the system in the presence of incomplete observations of the state. In the first part of this study assimilation is performed under the ""perfect model"" assumption, where SST observations are synthetically derived from a trajectory of the model. The focus is on how and why changes in the filter parameters (ensemble size, covariance localization, and covariance inflation) affect the quality of the analysis. It is shown that isotropic covariance localization does not benefit the analysis even when a small number of ensemble members are used. These results suggest that destruction of the ""balance"" between variables caused by localization is more detrimental than spurious correlation due to small ensemble size. In the second part of this study the EAKF is used to assimilate an independent dataset of SST observations. The EAKF/Zebiak-Cane assimilation system is able to correctly estimate the phase and intensity of ENSO, as measured by the average SST anomaly in the eastern equatorial Pacific. A comparison of the analysis herein to independent wind stress and thermocline depth datasets suggests that even with the assimilation of only SST observations it is possible to reproduce over 70% of the interannual variability of thermocline depth in the eastern equatorial Pacific and off the coast of the Philippine Islands. The interannual variability of zonal wind stress in the central and western equatorial Pacific is also well correlated with independent observations ( R > 0.75).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J CLIMATE,J.

To show that Denmark obtains significant quantities of birch pollen from Poland or Germany before the local trees start to flower. Simultaneous observations of pollen concentrations and phenology in the potential source area in Poland as well as in Denmark were performed in 2006. The Danish pollen records from 2000 to 2006 were analysed for possible long-range transport episodes and analysed with trajectories in combination with a birch tree source map. In 2006, high pollen concentrations were observed in Denmark with bi-hourly concentrations above 500 grains/m(3) before the local trees began to flower. Poland was identified as a source region.

In all episodes, trajectory analysis identified Germany or Poland as source regions. Denmark obtains significant pre-seasonal quantities of birch pollen from either Poland or Germany almost every year. Forecasting of birch pollen quantities relevant to allergy patients must therefore, take into account long-range transport. This cannot be based on measured concentrations in Denmark. The most effective way to improve the current Danish pollen forecasts is to extend the current forecasts with atmospheric transport models that take into account pollen emission and transport from countries such as Germany and Poland.

Under favourable environmental conditions, these blooms can occur and subside over rather short time scales-in the order of days to a few weeks. Very often, these blooms are observed in weakly flushed coastal waters under calin wind conditions-with or without stratification. Based on high-frequency field observations of harmful algal blooms at two coastal mariculture zones in Hong Kong. a mathematical model has been developed to forecast algal blooms. The model accounts for algal growth, decay, settling, and vertical turbulent mixing, and adopts the same assumptions as the classical Riley, Stommel and Bumpus model (Riley, G.A., Stommel). H.. Bumpus, D.F., 1949. Quantitative ecology of the plankton of the western North Atlantic. Bulletin of the Bingham Oceanographic Collection Yale University 12. 1-169). It is shown that for algal blooms to occur, a vertical stability criterion, E < 4 mu l(2)/pi(2), must be satisfied, where E, mu, l are the vertical turbulent diffusivity, algal growth rate, and euphotic layer depth respectively. In addition, a minimum nutrient threshold concentration must be reached. Moreover, with a nutrient competition consideration, the type of bloom (caused by motile or non-motile species) can be classified. The model requires as input simple and readily available field measurements of water column transparency and nutrient concentration, and representative maximum algal growth rate of the motile and non-motile species. In addition, with the use of three-dimensional hydrodynamic circulation models. simple relations are derived to estimate the vertical mixing coefficient as a function of tidal range, wind speed, and density stratification. The model gives a quick assessment of the likelihood of algal bloom occurrence, and has been validated against field observations over a 4-year period. The model helps to explain the observed spatial and temporal patterns of bloom Occurrences in relation to the vertical turbulence and nutrient condition. The success of the model points the way to the development of real time management models for disaster mitigation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, adopting the FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) equation as the standard for ET, estimation, an attempt was made to predict daily ETo using the public weather forecast messages available in China. These involve the cloudiness conditions, daily maximum and minimum temperature, and wind speed scales. An analytical method (AM) was developed to translate daily weather forecast messages into the variables needed to estimate ETo. Daily weather data for the period 1984-1998 at eight meteorological stations representing a wide range of climatic conditions of China were used to compute the FAO-PM ET, and to serve as reference data sets for comparison with the variables obtained from daily weather forecast messages at the same locations and period. Several statistical indicators were used for the respective comparisons. The sunshine duration (n) estimated from the forecasted cloudiness agree well with those observed as indicated by the Willmott indices of agreement, d, and the determination coefficient, R-2, higher than 0.99 and 0.96, respectively, at all locations. The translation of wind speed scales into wind speed values shows adequate, with a relative error, RE, near 0.10 and high values for d and R-2. The comparison of the actual vapour pressure estimated from the minimum temperature and computed from air humidity observations yielded d and R-2 values higher than 0.85 for all the locations except one, Ejina, located in an and region. The estimated weather parameters were then used to compute the daily ETo, with the FAO-PM equation for the eight locations. The weather forecasted ETo estimates agree well with the ETo values computed with full data sets, with d and R-2 for all locations larger than 0.95 and 0.91, respectively. However, the accuracy of these ET, estimations depends upon the availability of accurate weather forecast messages. Results indicate that daily ET. predictions using the public weather forecast messages are appropriate to be used for real-time water allocation and irrigation management. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In Italy ragweed occurs prevalently in north-north-eastern regions, where sensitization is increasing. Because of the small diameter of pollen grains, ragweed pollen is often involved in episodes of long-range transport, as already shown in central Italy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of such transport by comparing pollen and meteorological data for two northern Italian cities (Parma and Mantova) with data from Pistoia and Florence in central Italy. In 2002 and 2004 peaks in ragweed pollen levels were detected in these four cities on the same day, and concentrations of the grains were above clinical thresholds.

The results have improved understanding of relationships between changing microcystin concentrations, Microcystis species abundances and annual rainfall intensity. The data analysis by non-supervised ANN revealed that total Microcystis abundance and extra-cellular microcystin concentrations in typical dry years are much higher than those in typical wet years. It also showed that high microcystin concentrations in dry years coincided with the dominance of the toxic Microcystis Viridis whilst in typical wet years non-toxic Microcystis ichthyoblabe were dominant. Hybrid EA were used to discover rule sets to explain and forecast the occurrence of high microcystin concentrations in relation to water quality and climate conditions.

SAC is starting to be considered in the analysis of species distribution data, and over the last 10 years several studies have incorporated SAC into statistical models (here termed 'spatial models'). Here, I address the question of whether incorporating SAC affects estimates of model coefficients and inference from statistical models. Methods I review ecological studies that compare spatial and non-spatial models. Results In all cases coefficient estimates for environmental correlates of species distributions were affected by SAC, leading to a mis-estimation of on average c. 25%. Model fit was also improved by incorporating SAC. Main conclusions These biased estimates and incorrect model specifications have implications for predicting species occurrences under changing environmental conditions. Spatial models are therefore required to estimate correctly the effects of environmental drivers on species present distributions, for a statistically unbiased identification of the drivers of distribution, and hence for more accurate forecasts of future distributions.",,,,,"Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Generally, ecological models are built using occurrence data from a species' native range to predict the distribution in areas that the species may invade. However, historical and geographical constraints can limit a species' native distribution. Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP), an ecological niche modeling program, was used to predict the potential distribution of the invasive, freshwater New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, in Australia and North America. We compared the strength of the predictions made by models built with data from the snail's native range in New Zealand to models built with data from the locations invaded by the species. A time-series analysis of the Australian models demonstrated that range-of-invasion data can make better predictions about the potential distribution of invasive species than models built with native range data. Large differences among the model forecasts indicate that uncritical choice of the data set used in training the GARP models can result in misleading predictions.

The study was conducted at three highly contrasting ecosystems in South Texas over the period 1989-2000. Wavelet transform was introduced as a mathematical tool to denoise the NDVI time series. The simulated forage production, NDVI and denoised NDVI (DeNDVI) were subject to spectral decomposition for the detection of periodicities. Spectral analysis revealed bimodal vegetation growth patterns in Southwestern Texas. A yearly cycle (364 days) of peak vegetation production was detected for the three study sites, another peak forage production was revealed by spectral analysis at 182 days following the first peak in vegetation production. A similar trend was found for the NDVI imageries sensing the study sites. Wavelet denoising of NDVI signal was effective in revealing clear periodicities in one study site where maximum variability of NDVI was noted. The Box and Jenkins ARIMA modelling approach was used as a forecasting method for near-term forage production to assist range managers in proactive operational stocking decisions to mitigate drought risk. Using denoised NDVI provided forage projections with the lowest standard error prediction (SEP) throughout the forecast 84-day periods. However, acceptable SEP was only achieved up to 6 weeks into a projection for the forage-only based forecasts. The ARIMA forecasting methodology appears to offer a new approach to help managers of livestock production through the creation of near real-time early warning systems. Using satellite-derived NDVI data as a covariate improved the forecast quality and reduced the standard error of forecast in three highly contrasting sites. Denoising the NDVI data using wavelet methods further improved the forecast quality in all study sites. The integration of AVHRR NDVI data and biophysical simulation of forage production appears a promising approach for assisting decision makers in a positive manner by assessing forage conditions in response to emerging weather conditions and near real-time projection of available forage for grazing animals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

Quantifying this variability is essential to resolve ecosystem responses to eutrophication from variability imposed by climate. We developed a 'synoptic climatology' from surface sea-level pressure (SLP) maps to categorize and quantify atmospheric circulation patterns and address climate forcing of phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay. The 10 patterns we identified had unique frequencies-of-occurrence and associated meteorological conditions (i.e. precipitation, temperature, wind speed and direction). Four measures of phytoplankton biomass, surface chlorophyll a (B), euphotic layer chlorophyll a (B-eu), water column chlorophyll a (B-wc), and total biomass (B-tot), were obtained from remotely sensed ocean color data spanning 16 yr (1989 to 2004) combined with concurrent shipboard data. Years with more frequent warm/wet weather patterns had spring blooms that reached peak biomass farther seaward in the estuary, were greater in magnitude, occurred later in the spring, and covered a larger area than years with a predominance of cool/dry weather patterns. Frequencies of winter weather patterns were used to forecast spring B, B-eu, B-wc, and B-tot, explaining between 23 and 89% of the variance in the regional time-series. Residuals from these models did not show time-trends attributable to either accelerating eutrophication or management actions intended to decrease nutrient loadings. These findings extend our understanding of climatic influences on phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay by quantifying the effects of synoptic climate variability on spring bloom intensity, thereby supporting forecasts of seasonal phytoplankton biomass based on sub-continental scale weather patterns in this mid-Atlantic estuary.",,,,,"Miller, W.

Medusae were found within a relatively narrow range of temperature (26 to 30 C) and salinity (10 to 16). Regression analyses reveal that a combination of temperature and salinity is a significant predictor of medusa occurrence. Assessments of the predictive performance of these models using medusae and environmental data collected at independent survey sites (n = 354) indicated that model-predicted medusa occurrence and concentration correspond well with observations.

ARIMA modeling, Modeling for Optimal Forecasting techniques and Decision Support Systems based on fuzzy mathematics may be used to predict the general trend of a given fish landings time-series with increased reliability and accuracy. The present paper applies these three modeling methods to forecast anchovy fish catches landed in a given port (Thessaloniki, Greece) during 1979-2000 and hake and bonito total fish catches during 1982-2000. The paper attempts to assess the model's accuracy by comparing model results to the actual monthly fish catches of the year 2000. According to the measures of forecasting accuracy established, the best forecasting performance for anchovy was shown by the DSS model (MAPE = 28.06%, RMSE = 76.56, U-statistic = 0.67 and R-2 = 0.69). The optimal forecasting technique of genetic modeling improved significantly the forecasting values obtained by the selected ARIMA model. Similarly, the DSS model showed a noteworthy forecasting efficiency for the prediction of hake landings, during the year 2000 (MAPE = 2.88%, RMSE = 13.75, U-statistic = 0.19 and R-2 = 0.98), as compared to the other two modeling techniques. Optimal forecasting produced by combined modeling scored better than application of the simple ARIMA model. Overall, DSS results showed that the Fuzzy Expected Intervals methodology could be used as a very reliable tool for short-term predictions of fishery landings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence-absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. 2. In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. 3. The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. 4. When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence-absence maps.",,,,"Tsoar, Asaf/K-1374-2017; Lourenco, Carla R./M-3661-2013","Tsoar, Asaf/0000-0001-5572-7870; Lourenco, Carla R./0000-0002-6837-0986",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

This study assessed the applicability of the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) forage growth model for both strategic (long-term) and tactical (within-season) prediction of forage production in northern mixed-grass prairie. An improved version of the model was calibrated for conditions at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Long-term (1983-2001) simulations of peak standing crop (PSC) were compared to observations. Also, within-season (1983) forecasts of total aboveground biomass made for 1. March onward, 1 April onward, 1 May onward, and 1 June onward were compared to observations. The normal, driest, and wettest weather years on record (1915-1981) were used to simulate expected values, lower bounds, and upper bounds of biomass production, respectively. The forage model explained 66% of the variability in PSC from 1983 to 2001. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) derived from long-term simulated PSC overestimates cumulative probabilities for PSC > 1 500 kg.ha(-1). The generated CDF could be used strategically to estimate long-term forage production at various levels of probability, with errors in cumulative probability ranging from 0.0 to 0.16. Within-season forecasts explained 77%-94% of biomass variability in 1983. It was shown that monthly updating of the forage forecast, with input of actual weather to date, improves accuracy.

It is shown that at least small grains, such as birch pollen, can stay in the air for a few days, which leads to a characteristic scale for their transport of similar to 10(3) km. The analytical consideration confirmed the applicability of existing dispersion models to the pollen transport task and provided some reference parameterizations of the key processes, including dry and wet deposition. The results were applied to the Finnish Emergency Dispersion Modelling System (SILAM), which was then used to analyze pollen transport to Finland during spring time in 2002-2004. Solutions of the inverse problems (source apportionment) showed that the main source areas, from which the birch flowering can affect Finnish territory, are the Baltic States, Russia, Germany, Poland, and Sweden-depending on the particular meteorological situation. Actual forecasting of pollen dispersion required a birch forest map of Europe and a unified European model for birch flowering, both of which were nonexistent before this study.

Analytical models are only able to predict mean dispersal distances, whereas sophisticated trajectory simulation models are able to incorporate rare wind conditions causing long-distance dispersal and are therefore preferable. Despite the rapid development of mechanistic dispersal models, only a few studies have focused on comparing the performance of the models. To assess the level of model complexity needed, attention should be paid to model comparisons and the sensitivity of the predictions to model complexity.

We contrast this dispersal with the relatively unchanged distribution of Anopheles gambiae and examine possible future movements of this malaria vector. We use a comprehensive database of international ship and aircraft traffic movements, combined with climatic information, to remap the global transportation network in terms of disease vector suitability and accessibility. The expansion of the range of Ae. albopictus proved to be surprisingly predictable using this combination of climate and traffic data. Traffic volumes were more than twice as high on shipping routes running from the historical distribution of Ae. albopictus to ports where it has established in comparison with routes to climatically similar ports where it has yet to invade.

The techniques were evaluated based on their efficiency to forecast and their ability to utilise auxiliary environmental information. Applying a ""stepwise modelling"" technique, namely by adding stepwise predictors and comparing the quality of fit, certain inferences concerning the importance of the predictors were made. The ARIMA models predicted the test data very precisely (high R-2), especially if the target time series contained a strong autoregressive character, after they were first differenced to obtain stationarity (R-2 > 0.96). The disadvantage of the ARIMA, as with most statistical models, is their assumption that the relationships and system parameters remain the same across the observation and forecasting periods. The influence of temperature on catches was mainly investigated by applying neural models, which predicted the monthly landings with high precision (R-2 = 0.89), even when incorporating in the model exclusively monthly SST descriptors. Similarly, ANN models of annual landings containing monthly mean temperatures provided high precision (R-2 = 0.87) and valuable inference concerning the possible effect of the SST in certain months. Bayesian dynamic models also provided a high precision (R-2 = 0.96). They combined the information of both environmental and landing time series, namely the monthly mean temperatures and the monthly seasonality of the landings. The impact factors estimated from the model have the form of time series representing the temperature effect. The results reveal that both the monthly and the annual landings can be predicted and that the Bayesian model is the best performer overall, characterised by a higher number of stable forecasts, and forecasts with higher precision and accuracy, than the other methods. It is evident, from application of the ""stepwise modelling"" technique, that the incorporation of temperature descriptors can significantly improve the model performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A ELAM model is an individual-based model (IBM) coupling a (1) Eulerian framework to govern the physical, hydrodynamic, and water quality domains, (2) Lagrangian framework to govern the sensory perception and movement trajectories of individual fish, and (3) agent framework to govern the behavior decisions of individuals. The resulting ELAM framework is well suited for describing large-scale patterns in hydrodynamics and water quality as well as the much smaller scales at which individual fish make movement decisions. This ability of ELAM models to simultaneously handle dynamics at multiple scales allows them to realistically represent fish movements within aquatic systems. We introduce ELAMs with an application to aid in the design and operation of fish passage systems in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Individual virtual fish make behavior decisions about every 2.0 s. These are sub-meter to meter-scale movements based on hydrodynamic stimuli obtained from a hydraulic model. Movement rules and behavior coefficients are systematically adjusted until the virtual fish movements approximate the observed fish. The ELAM model introduced in this paper is called the Numerical Fish Surrogate. It facilitated the development of a mechanistic biological-based hypothesis describing observed 3-D movement and passage response of downstream migrating juvenile salmon at 3 hydropower dams on 2 rivers with a total of 20 different structural and operational configurations. The Numerical Fish Surrogate is presently used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and public utility districts during project planning and design to forecast juvenile salmon movement and passage response to alternative bypass structures.

Deterministic models provide point estimates of X, the finite rate of increase, as well as measures of matrix sensitivity and elasticity. Stationary matrix models can be used to estimate extinction risk in a variable environment, but they assume that the matrix elements are randomly sampled from a stationary (i.e., non-changing) distribution. Here we outline a method for using nonstationary matrix model!; to construct realistic forecasts of population fluctuation in changing environments. Our method requires three pieces of data: (I) field estimates of transition matrix elements, (2) experimental data on the demographic responses of populations. to altered environmental conditions, and (3) forecasting data on environmental drivers. These three pieces of data are combined to generate a series of sequential transition matrices that emulate a pattern of long-term change in environmental drivers. Realistic estimates of population persistence and extinction risk can be derived from stochastic permutations of such a model. We illustrate the steps of this analysis with data from two population's of Sarracenia purpurea growing in northern New England. Sarracenia purpurea is a perennial carnivorous plant that is potentially at risk of local extinction because of increased nitrogen deposition. Long-term monitoring records or models of environmental change can be used to generate time series of driver variables under different scenarios of changing environments. Both manipulative and natural experiments can be used to construct a linking function that describes how matrix parameters change as a function of the environmental driver. This synthetic modeling approach provides quantitative estimates of extinction probability that have an explicit mechanistic basis.",,,,,"Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

A Growing Degree Days forecasting model was used. together with future meteorological data forecast using the Regional Climate Model developed by the Hadley Meteorological Centre, in order to determine the expected advance in the start of Quercus pollination in future years. At each study site, airborne pollen curves presented a similar pattern in all study years, with different peaks over the season attributable in many cases to the presence of several species. High pollen concentrations were recorded, particularly at Mediterranean sites. This study also proposes forecasting models to predict both daily pollen values and annual pollen emission. All models were externally validated using data for 2001 and 2004, with acceptable results. Finally, the impact of the highly-likely climate change on Iberian Quercus pollen concentration values was studied by applying RCM meteorological data for different future years, 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2099.

However, long-distance transport of birch pollen before the onset of local flowering may complicate the utilization of phenological observations in pollen forecasting. We compared the timing of leaf bud burst of silver birch with the timing of the stages of birch pollen season during an eight year period (1997-2004) at five sites in Finland. The stages of the birch pollen season were defined using four different thresholds: 1) the first date of the earliest three-day period with airborne birch pollen counts exceeding 10 grains m(-3) air; and the dates when the accumulated pollen sum reaches 2) 5%; 3) 50% and 4) 95% of the annual total. Atmospheric modelling was used to determine the source areas for the observed long-distance transported pollen, and the exploitability of phenological observations in pollen forecasting was evaluated. Pair-wise comparisons of means indicate that the timing of leaf bud burst fell closest to the date when the accumulated pollen sum reached 5% of the annual total, and did not differ significantly from it at any site (p < 0.05; Student-Newman-Keuls test).

Recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model projections and there remains a need to test the accuracy of models and to reduce uncertainties.

These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have led to massive fish kills, hypoxia, and beach closures. However, to date the causality and mechanism of coastal algal blooms are still poorly understood. A remotely controlled autonomous real time field monitoring system has been developed to continuously track the changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, dissolved oxygen and other hydro-meteorological variables at two representative mariculture zones. The system can give an alarm when a bloom is detected, so that timely manual water quality sampling can be carried out to supplement the telemetric data. During 2000-2003, the system has successfully tracked 19 algal blooms. In the shallow weakly flushed coastal water (depth 7-10 m, tidal current 5-19 cm s(-1)), the bloom is short-lived, typically lasting a few days to over a week, with chlorophyll and DO concentrations in the range of 20-40 mg m(-3) and 2-15 g m(-3), respectively. It is found that: (1) the chlorophyll concentration is strongly correlated with its past values in the previous week, suggesting an auto-regressive type of algal dynamics; (2) the dissolved oxygen can reach highly super-saturated levels (12 g m(-3)) during a diatom bloom, and decreases to below 4 g m(-3) at the tail of the growth phase; (3) in contrast, a dinoflagellate bloom is characterized by a much more pronounced vertical structure. Diel vertical migration and aggregation to dense layers are clearly observed. Significant dissolved oxygen consumption is associated with the migration, resulting in DO drops by as much as 6 g m(-3) during the bloom; (4) the predominance of diatoms and dinoflagellates at the two sites can be explained in terms of the different hydrographic and nutrient conditions (the N:P ratio). Net algal growth rate, sinking and swimming velocities are derived from the in situ bloom data. The 4-year high frequency data set provides a basis for development of models for forecast of harmful algal blooms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Biological invasions have an anthropogenic origin, and although many species are able to spread on their own within the newly invaded area, long-distance dispersal events shown to accelerate rates of spread are frequently associated with human activities. In a previous study, the performances of several invasion models of the spread of the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella in Germany were compared, demonstrating that the best model in qualitative and quantitative terms was a stratified dispersal model taking into account the effect of human population density on the probability of long-distance dispersal events. 2. Similar data were collected in France over 4 years (2000-2004, 5274 observation points). These data were used to assess the performance of the best-fit models from Germany using the original parameters and to model the spread of the leafminer in France. 3. The stratified dispersal model accounting for variations in human population density developed in Germany, predicted the invasion of France with a similar level of predictive power as in the area where it was developed. This suggests that an equivalent level of predictability can be expected in a newly invaded country with similar environmental conditions. 4. We applied the model to forecast the future invasion dynamics in the UK from 2005 to 2008, based on the first observations of Cameraria in the country in 2002-2004. Predictions are discussed in the light of different prevailing environmental conditions. 5. Synthesis and application. The model and predictions developed in this study provide one of the few examples of an a priori model of invasion in a newly invaded country, and provide a simple modelling framework that can be used to explore the spread of other invading organisms. In the case of Cameraria, little can be done to prevent or slow its spread but our model, by predicting changes in distribution and rates of spread, provides fore-warning of where and when damaging pest populations are likely to appear.",,,,"Guichard, Sylvain/F-8706-2011; Gilbert, Marius/C-6969-2009; Gregoire, Jean-Claude/F-4397-2011","Gilbert, Marius/0000-0003-3708-3359; Gregoire, Jean-Claude/0000-0002-3346-4130",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

An ocean data quality-control system is fully integrated with the multivariate analysis, and includes feedback of forecast fields and prediction errors in the quality control of new observations. The system is operational at the US Navy oceanographic production centres both in global and in regional applications.

Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues.

Observations from a validation array of current meter and thermistor moorings deployed on a cross-shore line through the center of the LEO intensive observing area were used to formulate a set of quantitative model skill metrics that focused on aspects of the two-layer wind-driven upwelling and downwelling circulation that characterizes ocean dynamics during the stratified summer season along this coast.

This is particularly true for cases where a measurement of recruitment is not available until after substantial fishing on this recruitment has already taken place. The South African anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resource reflects such a situation, and forms the basis for a simulation study to investigate the benefits of using environmental indices to set appropriate Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Simulations, based on a 'management procedure' (sensu the International Whaling Commission), investigate how such benefits are related to the proportion of variation in recruitment explained by the environmental index. Furthermore, they evaluate to what extent these benefits are compromised by uncertainties related to the degrees of freedom effect (over-fitting data), the selection of explanatory variables (danger of spurious correlations), and errors in the values of explanatory variables (including measurement error). Five recruitment prediction models that incorporate increasing numbers of these uncertainties are investigated. These predictions are used to adjust TACs depending on whether they indicate forthcoming recruitment to be in the top or bottom third of the distribution of possible recruitment values. Results indicate that an environmental index needs to explain roughly 50 % or more of the total variation in recruitment (r(2) >= 0.5) before the management procedure starts showing benefits in terms of the summary performance statistics for risk and average catch. Comparable benefits are possible at a lower r(2) value when TAC constraints are removed, but there is then a large associated increase in interannual catch variation. When r(2) is low, performance in terms of average catch may prove worse if attempting to take account of an environmental variable in setting the TAC than ignoring it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

Risk analyses for accidental introductions of ruffe to inland lakes should focus on the chance of establishment for small introductions such as those that would result from transporting ruffe as bait. Here I use Akaike's Information Criterion to select a population growth model for ruffe based on observed population dynamics during the invasion of Loch Lomond, Scotland. This population is regulated by a high carrying capacity and Allee effects were undetected. Parameter estimates obtained from this population forecast that the chance of establishment for possible introductions of ruffe to inland lakes in North America is high. A model for ruffe winter survival suggests that survivorship between introductions and spawning may be an important determinant of establishment success, but that the chance of establishment is high for introductions of only a few individuals. To prevent invasions of ruffe in inland waters, release of ruffe, whether intentional or accidental, should not be tolerated.",,,,"Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members;, this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January-June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90% BMA prediction intervals were 66% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.",,,,"Gneiting, Tilmann/A-8773-2009","Gneiting, Tilmann/0000-0001-9397-3271",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

All tests for inoculum production from the surface of infected coast live oak bark or exudates from cankers were negative. In contrast, sporangia and chlamydospores were produced on the surface of infected bay laurel leaves. Mean number of zoospores produced from infected bay laurel leaves under natural field conditions during rainstorms was 1,173.0 +/- SE 301.48, and ranged as high as 5,200 spores/leaf. P. ramorum was recovered from rainwater, soil, litter, and streamwater during the mid-to late rainy season in all 3 years of the study. P. ramorum was not recovered from sporadic summer rains or soil and litter during the hot, dry summer months. Concentrations of inoculum in rainwater varied significantly from year to year and increased as the rainy season progressed for the two complete seasons that were studied. Potential dispersal distances were investigated for rainwater, soil, and streamwater. In rainwater, inoculum moved 5 and 10 m from the inoculum source. For soil, transmission of inoculum was demonstrated from infested soil to bay laurel green leaf litter, and from bay laurel green leaf litter to aerial leaves of bay laurel seedlings. One-third to one-half of the hikers tested at the study site during the rainy season also were carrying infested soil on their shoes. In streamwater, P. ramorum was recovered from an unforested site in pasture approximate to 1 km downstream of forest with inoculum sources.

Their difference, the mass of the dry atmosphere, is estimated to be constant for the equivalent surface pressure to within 0.01 hPa based on changes in atmospheric composition. Global reanalyses satisfy this constraint for monthly means for 1979-2001 with a standard deviation of 0.065 hPa. New estimates of the total mass of the atmosphere and its dry component, and their corresponding surface pressures, are larger than previous estimates owing to new topography of the earth's surface that is 5.5 m lower for the global mean. Global mean total surface pressure is 985.50 hPa, 0.9 hPa higher than previous best estimates. The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480 X 10(18) kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5 X 10(15) kg depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; this is somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27 X 10(16) kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 +/- 0.0003 X 10(18) kg. The water vapor contribution varies with an annual cycle of 0.29-hPa, a maximum in July of 2.62 hPa, and a minimum in December of 2.33 hPa, although the total global surface pressure has a slightly smaller range. During the 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Ninio events, water vapor amounts and thus total mass increased by about 0.1 hPa in surface pressure or 0.5 X 10(15) kg for several months. Some evidence exists for slight decreases following the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and also for upward trends associated with increasing global mean temperatures, but uncertainties due to the changing observing system compromise the evidence. The physical constraint of conservation of dry air mass is violated in the reanalyses with increasing magnitude prior to the assimilation of satellite data in both ERA-40 and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalyses. The problem areas are shown to occur especially over the Southern Oceans. Substantial spurious changes are also found in surface pressures due to water vapor, especially in the Tropics and subtropics prior to 1979.",,,,"Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012","Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J CLIMATE,J.

However, these data may be patchy, and have gaps or biases. An alternative approach to generating C budgets has been to use process-based models, constructed to simulate the key processes involved in C exchange. However, the process of model building is arguably subjective, and parameters may be poorly defined. This paper demonstrates why data assimilation (DA) techniques - which combine stock and flux observations with a dynamic model - improve estimates of, and provide insights into, ecosystem carbon (C) exchanges. We use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to link a series of measurements with a simple box model of C transformations. Measurements were collected at a young ponderosa pine stand in central Oregon over a 3-year period, and include eddy flux and soil CO2 efflux data, litterfall collections, stem surveys, root and soil cores, and leaf area index data. The simple C model is a mass balance model with nine unknown parameters, tracking changes in C storage among five pools; foliar, wood and fine root pools in vegetation, and also fresh litter and soil organic matter (SOM) plus coarse woody debris pools. We nested the EnKF within an optimization routine to generate estimates from the data of the unknown parameters and the five initial conditions for the pools. The efficacy of the DA process can be judged by comparing the probability distributions of estimates produced with the EnKF analysis vs. those produced with reduced data or model alone. Using the model alone, estimated net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE)=-251+/-197 g C m(-2) over the 3 years, compared with an estimate of -419+/-29 g C m(-2) when all observations were assimilated into the model. The uncertainty on daily measurements of NEE via eddy fluxes was estimated at 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1), but the uncertainty on assimilated estimates averaged 0.47 g C m(-2) day(-1), and only exceeded 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) on days where neither eddy flux nor soil efflux data were available. In generating C budgets, the assimilation process reduced the uncertainties associated with using data or model alone and the forecasts of NEE were statistically unbiased estimates. The results of the analysis emphasize the importance of time series as constraints. Occasional, rare measurements of stocks have limited use in constraining the estimates of other components of the C cycle. Long time series are particularly crucial for improving the analysis of pools with long time constants, such as SOM, woody biomass, and woody debris. Long-running forest stem surveys, and tree ring data, offer a rich resource that could be assimilated to provide an important constraint on C cycling of slow pools. For extending estimates of NEE across regions, DA can play a further important role, by assimilating remote-sensing data into the analysis of C cycles. We show, via sensitivity analysis, how assimilating an estimate of photosynthesis - which might be provided indirectly by remotely sensed data - improves the analysis of NEE.",,,,"Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Airborne pollen of Cupressaceae, Urticaceae, Quercus spp. and O. europaea make up approximately 70% of the total average annual pollen counts. The set of data that we worked with represented days without precipitation and time intervals during which winds blew from the same direction for at least 4 consecutive hours. We did this in order to study the effect of the different wind components independently of precipitation, and to avoid secondary effects produced by pollen resuspension phenomena. Factorial regression analysis among the summed bi-hourly pollen counts for each taxon and the values of wind speed and persistence per wind direction gave significant results in 22 cases (combinations of plant taxa and wind directions). The pollen concentrations of all taxa correlated significantly with at least one of the three wind components. In seven out of the 22 taxon-wind direction combinations, the pollen counts correlated positively with wind persistence, whereas this was the case for only two of the taxon-wind speed combinations. In seven cases, pollen counts correlated with the interaction effect of wind speed and persistence. This shows the importance of wind persistence in pollen transport, particularly when weak winds prevail for a considerable part of the year, as is the case for Thessaloniki. Medium/long-distance pollen transport was evidenced for Olea (NW, SW directions), Corylus (NW, SW), Poaceae (SW) and Populus (NW).",,,,"Damialis, Athanasios/C-6109-2013; Damialis, Athanasios/P-9072-2018","Damialis, Athanasios/0000-0001-6400-384X; Damialis, Athanasios/0000-0003-2917-5667",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

While the heuristics of 'pulses', 'triggers' and 'reserves' are intuitive and thus appealing, the value of the paradigm is limited, both as a conceptual model of how pulsed water inputs are translated into primary production and as a framework for developing quantitative models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a revision of the pulse-reserve model that emphasizes the following: (1) what explicitly constitutes a biologically significant 'rainfall pulse', (2) how do rainfall pulses translate into usable 'soil moisture pulses', and (3) how are soil moisture pulses differentially utilized by various plant functional types (FTs) in terms of growth? We explore these questions using the patch and lands simulation (PALS) model for sites in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. Our analyses indicate that rainfall variability is best understood in terms of sequences of rainfall events that produce biologically-significant 'pulses' of soil moisture recharge, as opposed to individual rain events. In the desert regions investigated, biologically significant pulses of soil moisture occur in either winter (October-March) or summer (July September), as determined by the period of activity of the plant FTs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding specific growth responses to moisture pulses, because of the strong effects of and interactions between precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and plant FT responses, all of which vary among deserts and seasons. Our results further suggest that, in most soil types and in most seasons, there is little separation of soil water with depth. Thus, coexistence of plant FTs in a single patch as examined in this PALS study is likely to be fostered by factors that promote: (1) separation of water use over time (seasonal differences in growth), (2) relative differences in the utilization of water in the upper soil layers, or (3) separation in the responses of plant FTs as a function of preceding conditions, i.e., the physiological and morphological readiness of the plant for water-uptake and growth. Finally, the high seasonal and annual variability in soil water recharge and plant growth, which result from the complex interactions that occur as a result of rainfall variability, antecedent soil moisture conditions, nutrient availability, and plant FT composition and cover, call into question the use of simplified vegetation models in forecasting potential impacts of climate change in the and zones in North America.",,,,"Reynolds, James F/G-6364-2010","Fernandez, Roberto/0000-0003-3094-569X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2004,141,2,,,,,194,210,,10.1007/s00442-004-1524-4,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000224528200002,,,,,

However, biomes differ substantially in sensitivity of aboveground net primary production ( ANPP) to between-year variation in precipitation(6-8). Average rain-use efficiency ( RUE; ANPP/precipitation) also varies between biomes, supposedly because of differences in vegetation structure and/or biogeochemical constraints(8). Here we show that RUE decreases across biomes as mean annual precipitation increases. However, during the driest years at each site, there is convergence to a common maximum RUE (RUEmax) that is typical of arid ecosystems. RUEmax was also identified by experimentally altering the degree of limitation by water and other resources. Thus, in years when water is most limiting, deserts, grasslands and forests all exhibit the same rate of biomass production per unit rainfall, despite differences in physiognomy and site-level RUE. Global climate models(9,10) predict increased between-year variability in precipitation, more frequent extreme drought events, and changes in temperature.

Routine monitoring data are not sufficient for early warning due to the large temporal and spatial variability in the occurrence of surface waterblooms, and the time lag between the formation of the scum and the availability of relevant information for risk management. We combined a ""traditional"" dynamic simulation model based upon differential equations with fuzzy logic to describe the three main conditions governing surface waterbloom formation: (1) a preexisting population of cyanobacteria, (2) buoyancy of the cells, and (3) stability of the water column. The attributes and membership functions of the fuzzy model were based on earlier field studies of diel changes in buoyancy and vertical distribution of cyanobacteria. The model was applied without further calibration to the large lake IJsselmeer (1200 km(2)) in the Netherlands, and we validated the model output using 12 years of NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers) satellite images on which surface blooms are discernible as an enhanced vegetation index or increased surface water temperature. Existing surface blooms were predicted with high accuracy, but additional blooms were also predicted. A statistical test (Cohen's Kappa) showed that correct predictions of the absence or presence of surface blooms were highly unlikely to have occurred by chance only. The model can be used to predict the occurrence of surface waterblooms in advance on the basis of the long-term weather forecast, leaving time for appropriate management of the problem.

Most of the abandonment occurred 30 to 40 years ago and this process has now stopped. Thus, we lack data on the very first phase of tree colonization. We anticipate that a simulation tool could bring an appreciable help in (i) rebuilding the entire colonization process-including the initial phase-of pine settlement and (ii) answering questions about the origin of the narrow and unimodal distributions of age of pine stands we observed. In addition, such a simulator could help managers to forecast extension of Scots pine and to predict growth and evolution of present secondary forests. A spatially explicit individual-based model is presented. The model takes into account both space and time and includes growth of trees, seed production and seed dispersal, death and competition between individuals. The influence of the initial parameters are analyzed and elements of validation given. The model was then used to predict tree settlement and stand establishment using the initial conditions from a natural stand studied in the field whose characteristics before abandonment were known (number and age-distribution of trees, location of mother trees, time of abandonment). Three simulations were achieved by using the same initial conditions but following different scenarios for the recruitment process. The scenario of a fluctuating resistance of the resident vegetation (that controls the susceptibility of the environment to tree establishment) seemed as one of the most probable to explain the actual stand characteristics. We thus concluded that dynamic models could be improved by taking into account the resistance of the vegetation to colonization as a fluctuating parameter instead of a static and permanent attribute.",,,,"Coquillard, Patrick/D-6550-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2003,168,1,,,,,121,137,,10.1023/A:1024404214782,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,,,WOS:000183835900011,,,,,

Blooms of these organisms are attributed to two primary factors: natural processes such as circulation, upwelling relaxation, and river flow; and, anthropogenic loadings leading to eutrophication. Unfortunately, the latter is commonly assumed to be the primary cause of all blooms, which is not the case in many instances. Moreover, although it is generally acknowledged that occurrences of these phenomena are increasing throughout the world's oceans, the reasons for this apparent increase remain debated and include not only eutrophication but increased observation efforts in coastal zones of the world. There is a rapidly advancing monitoring effort resulting from the perception of increased impacts from these HABs, manifested as expanding routine coastal monitoring programs, rapid development and deployment of new detection methods for individual species, toxins, and toxicities, and expansion of coastal modeling activities towards observational forecasts of bloom landfall and eventually bloom prediction.

Typically, model predictions are extremely sensitive to estimated parameters, resulting in risk estimates that are very imprecise. Therefore, careful consideration of uncertainty is warranted when reporting PVA predictions. Here, we survey some simple and general simulation-based methods for assessing the uncertainty in model-based forecasts. We then illustrate how these methods can be used for incorporating parameter uncertainty when reporting estimates of extinction risk, using a PVA model developed from data on Pacific Chinook salmon stocks. Several researchers have suggested that relative assessments between management options will be more stable than estimates of extinction risk and population growth rate. We illustrate how the uncertainty in relative assessments can be quantified in a rigorous way. Finally, we show how Sobol' indices can be used to ask: ""Where is the uncertainty coming from?"" These indices are an ANOVA-like decomposition of the effects of parameters on model output that take into account both direct effects (as in standard sensitivity analysis) and effects due to interactions with other parameters. Throughout, we illustrate these methods using models relevant to the life cycle of Pacific salmon, with the intent of assessing the relative influences of habitat, harvest, and hatcheries on the viability of salmon populations.

Beginning in 1999, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued the Gulf of Mexico HAB Bulletins to support state monitoring and management efforts. These bulletins involve analysis of satellite imagery with field and meteorological station data. The effort involves several components or models: (a) monitoring the movement of an algal bloom that has previously been identified as a HAB (type 1 forecast); (b) detecting new blooms as HAB or non-HAB (type 2); (c) predicting the movement of an identified HAB (type 3); (d) predicting conditions favorable for a HAB to occur where blooms have not yet been observed (type 4). The types 1 and 2 involve methods of bloom detection requiring routine remote sensing, especially satellite ocean color imagery and in situ data. Prediction (types 3 and 4) builds on the monitoring capability by using interpretative and numerical modeling. Successful forecasts cover more than 1000 km of coast and require routine input of remotely sensed and in situ data. The data sources used in this effort include ocean colorimagery from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor/OrbView-2 satellite and processed using coastal-specific algorithms, wind data from coastal and offshore buoys, field observations of bloom location and intensity provided by state agencies, and forecasts from the National Weather Service. The HAB Bulletins began in coordination with the state of Florida in autumn of 1999 and included K. brevis bloom monitoring (type 1), with limited advisories on transport (type 3) and the detection of blooms in new areas (type 2). In autumn 2000, we improved both the transport forecasts and detection capabilities and began prediction of conditions favorable for bloom development (type 4). The HAB Bulletins have had several successes. The state of Florida was advised of the potential for a bloom to occur at the end of September 2000 (type 4), and the state was alerted to the position of blooms in January 2000 and October 2001 in areas that had not been previously sampled (type 3). These successful communications of HAB activity allowed Florida agencies responsible for shellfish management and public health to respond to a rapidly developing event in a timely, efficient manner.

The commonly used back-propagation learning algorithm is employed for training the ANN. The modeling is based on (a) comprehensive biweekly water quality data at Tolo Harbour (1982-2000); and (b) 4-year set of weekly phytoplankton abundance data at Lamina Island (1996-2000). Algal biomass is represented as chlorophyll-a and cell concentration of Skeletonema at the two locations, respectively. Analysis of a large number of scenarios shows that the best agreement with observations is obtained by using merely the time-lagged algal dynamics as the network input. In contrast to previous findings with more complicated neural networks of algal blooms in freshwater systems, the present work suggests the algal concentration in the eutrophic sub-tropical coastal water is mainly dependent on the antecedent algal concentrations in the previous 1-2 weeks. This finding is also supported by an interpretation of the neural networks' weights. Through a systematic analysis of network performance, it is shown that previous reports of predictability of algal dynamics by ANN are erroneous in that 'future data' have been used to drive the network prediction. In addition, a novel real time forecast of coastal algal blooms based on weekly data at Lamina is presented. Our study shows that an ANN model with a small number of input variables is able to capture trends of algal dynamics, but data with a minimum sampling interval of 1 week is necessary. However, the sufficiency of the weekly sampling for real time predictions using ANN models needs to be further evaluated against longer weekly data sets as they become available.

Annual abundance indices (1970-1996) were derived from fishery data, for stocks in coastal waters (northern North Sea and West Coast) and the Rockall area. Abundance in coastal waters was correlated. with several annual environmental indices, including the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index and the average sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) in the northern North Sea. Regression models, relating fishery abundance to annual environmental indices, and time-series models, predicting abundance from the previous year's abundance, could both provide reasonable fits to observed abundance data. Model fits obtained for coastal waters were generally better than those for the Rockall area. Regression models produced consistently poor forecasts whereas time-series models produced satisfactory forecasts for the years 1997-1999. Forecast accuracy for the time-series models could be improved by taking into account environmental variables. Thus, adding effects of SST in May in the northern North Sea in the current and previous years improved a time-series model of squid abundance in coastal waters. Improved forecasts were also achieved by fitting time-series models to monthly abundance data. The apparent influence of May SST in the northern North Sea on the coastal fishery could indicate that SST affects recruitment strength. Results for the offshore Rockall fishery suggest that large-scale and longer-term oceanographic processes may be involved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Recent research activities in forecasting with artificial neural networks (ANNs) suggest that ANNs can be a promising alternative to the traditional linear methods. ARIMA models and ANNs are often compared with mixed conclusions in terms of the superiority in forecasting performance. In this paper, a hybrid methodology that combines both ARIMA and ANN models is proposed to take advantage of the unique strength of ARIMA and ANN models in linear and nonlinear modeling. Experimental results with real data sets indicate that the combined model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by either of the models used separately.

The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the filter's performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update time are reduced by 55% (or 70%; or 80%) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84% for the optimal smoother). For robust error variance estimates, an ensemble of at least 500 members is needed. The dynamic evolution of the estimation error variances is dominated by wetting and drying events with high variances during drydown and low variances when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Furthermore, the ensemble distribution of soil moisture is typically symmetric except under very dry or wet conditions when the effects of the nonlinearities in the model become significant. As a result, the actual errors are consistently larger than ensemble-derived forecast and analysis error variances. This suggests that the update is suboptimal. However, the degree of suboptimality is relatively small and results presented here indicate that the EnKF is a flexible and robust data assimilation option that gives satisfactory estimates even for moderate ensemble sizes.",,,,"Reichle, Rolf H/E-1419-2012","Reichle, Rolf H/0000-0001-5513-0150",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

The improvement amounts to about a 1-day gain in predictability of mean-sea-level pressure and 500 hPa height over the last decade in the northern hemisphere, with a similar gain over the last 3 years in the southern hemisphere. Differences between the initial analyses from the three systems have been substantially reduced. Detailed study of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts verifications shows that identifiable improvements in the data assimilation, model and observing systems have significantly increased the accuracy of both short- and medium-range forecasts, although interannual (flow-dependent) variations in error-growth characteristics complicate the picture. The implied r.m.s. error of 500 hPa height analyses has fallen well below the 10 in level typical of radiosonde measurement error. Intrinsic error-doubling times, computed from the divergence of northern hemisphere forecasts started I day apart, exhibit a small overall reduction over the past 10 years at day two and beyond, and a much larger reduction at day one. Error-doubling times for the southern hemisphere have become generally shorter and are now similar to those for the northern hemisphere. One-day forecast errors have been reduced so much in the southern hemisphere that medium-range forecasts for the region have become almost as skilful as those for the northern hemisphere. The approach to saturation of forecast error beyond the 10-day range has been examined for sets of 21-day forecasts. When the systematic (sample-mean) component of the error is subtracted, forecast errors and the differences between successive forecasts both appear to level out near the end of the 2 1-day range at values close to the limit set by the natural level of variance of the atmosphere for the northern hemisphere. A number of features of the model 500 hPa height fields remain quite realistic at the three-week range. The most obvious discrepancy in mean climate is in the Pacific/North-American sector, and variance is too high in the southern hemisphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q. J. R. Meteorol.

Even though rarely used by ecologists, gravity models allow estimation of long-distance dispersal between discrete points in heterogeneous landscapes. We developed a production-constrained gravity model to forecast zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) dispersal into inland lakes of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin (USA) based on the site and location of lakes and the number and location of boats within 364 counties. A deterministic form of this model was used to estimate best-fit parameters for distance coefficient, Great Lakes boat-ramp attractiveness, and colonization Cutoff threshold. A stochastic model thus developed from these parameters allows for random changes in colonization likelihood. The results of our model are highly correlated with the actual pattern of colonized lakes in southern Michigan and southeastern Wisconsin at the end of 1997. Areas of central Wisconsin and western Michigan, where zebra mussel colonies have not been documented, were also predicted to be colonized, suggesting that future invasions may be imminent in these locations. These analyses suggest that gravity models may be useful in predicting long-distance dispersal when dispersal abilities of species and the attractiveness of potential habitats are known.",,,,"Bossenbroek, Jonathan/F-3664-2011; Bossenbroek, Jonathan/C-9184-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In most instances, multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm have been used. The major shortcoming of this approach is that the knowledge contained in the trained networks is difficult to interpret. One way to increase model transparency is to use neurofuzzy approaches, which enable the information that is stored in trained networks to be expressed in the form of a fuzzy rule base. In this paper, B-spline associative memory networks (AMNs), which have been shown to be learning equivalent to certain types of fuzzy models, are used to forecast concentrations of the cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia, 4 weeks in advance. The ASMOD (adaptive spline modeling of observation data) algorithm is used to optimise the model structure and the number of model inputs. The sensitivity of the model to the order of the basis functions and a number of stopping criteria is investigated. The performance of the various models is assessed in terms of forecasting accuracy and model transparency, and compared with that of a MLP model developed in a previous study. It is found that lower order basis functions and Bayes' Information Criterion (BIC) give the best model performance, both in terms of forecasting accuracy and transparency. The accuracy of the forecasts obtained using the B-spline AMN and MLP models is comparable, although the AMN may be considered to perform marginally better overall. In addition, the AMN provides more explicit information about the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. The fuzzy rules obtained from the AMN model suggest that incidences of Anabaena spp. generally occur after the passing of a flood hydrograph and when water temperatures are high.

While SALMO is driven by process-based differential equations, the model ANNA is designed as recurrent feedforward neural network trained by time series data. Predictions of chlorophyll-a for the years 1979-1982 by both models were validated by means of measured data. Results showed that SALMO is able to predict annual average trends not only of chlorophyll-a but other chemical and biological state variables as well. It supports decision making by evaluating alternative scenarios for strategic eutrophication control. The model ANNA achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting timing and magnitudes of algal biomass up to 7 days ahead. The recurrent feedforward architecture of ANNA proved to be most efficient in order to model and predict seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its forecasting results can be utilized for early warning and tactical control of algal blooms in freshwater lakes. A sensitivity analysis conducted by ANNA revealed that algal abundance in Burrinjuck Reservoir is not only driven by physical and chemical characteristics of the water body but to a large extend by hydrological characteristics such as water depth as well.

This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These tools are based on particular choices for the underlying population dynamics model, the aspects of the assessment considered uncertain, and the approach for assessing uncertainty (Bayes, frequentist or likelihood). The current state of the art is advancing rapidly as a consequence of the availability of increased computational power, but there remains little consistency in the choices made for assessments and forecasts. This can be explained by several factors including the specifics of the species under consideration, the purpose for which the analysis is conducted and the institutional framework within which the methods are developed and used, including the availability and customary usage of software tools. Little testing of either the methods or their assumptions has yet been done. Thus, it is not possible to argue either that the methods perform well or perform poorly or that any particular conditioning choices are more appropriate in general terms than others. Despite much recent progress, fisheries science has yet to identify a means for identifying appropriate conditioning choices such that the probability distributions which are calculated for management purposes do adequately represent the probabilities of eventual real outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that increased focus should be placed on testing and carefully examining the choices made when conducting these analyses, and that more attention must be given to examining the sensitivity to alternative assumptions and model structures.

The comparison of the forecast simulation efficiency of the first-order Takagi-Sugeno combination method with the other three combination methods demonstrates that the first-order Takagi-Sugeno method is just as efficient as both the WAM and the NNM in enhancing the flood forecasting accuracy.

The comparative successes of these two approaches are a subject of substantial inquiry and some controversy. Presented in this article is a new procedure for long-lead forecasting of tropical Pacific SST fields that expresses qualitative aspects of scientific paradigms for SST dynamics in a statistical manner. Through this combining of substantial physical understanding and statistical modeling and learning, this procedure acquires considerable predictive skill. Specifically, a Markov model, applied to a low-order (empirical orthogonal function-based) dynamical system of tropical Pacific SST, with stochastic regime transition, is considered.

This study reviews issues and approaches related to applying crop models at scales larger than the plot, Perfect aggregate prediction at larger scales requires perfect integration of a perfect model across the range of variability of perfect input data. Aggregation error results from imperfect integration of heterogeneous inputs, and includes distortions of either spatial mean values of predictions or year-to-year variability of the spatial means. Approaches for reducing aggregation error include sampling input variability in geographic or probability space, and calibration of model inputs or outputs. Implications of scale and spatial interactions for model structure and complexity are a matter of ongoing debate.

In the vast majority of cases, multilayer perceptrons that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm are used. One of the major shortcomings of this approach is that it is difficult to elicit the knowledge about the input/output mapping that is stored in the trained networks. One way to overcome this problem is to use B-spline associative memory networks (AMNs), because their connection weights may be interpreted as a set of fuzzy membership functions and hence the relationship between the model inputs and outputs may be written as a set of fuzzy rules. In this paper, multilayer perceptrons and AMN models are compared, and their main advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The performance of both model types is compared in terms of prediction accuracy and model transparency for a particular water quality case study, the forecasting (4 weeks in advance) of concentrations of the cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia. The forecasts obtained using both model types are good. Neither model clearly outperforms the other, although the forecasts obtained when the B-spline AMN model is used may be considered slightly better overall. In addition, the B-spline AMN model provides more explicit information about the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. The fuzzy rules extracted from the B-spline AMN model indicate that incidences of Anabaena spp, are likely to occur after the passing of a flood hydrograph and when water temperatures are high.",,,,"Maier, Holger R/B-9639-2008","Maier, Holger R/0000-0002-0277-6887; Sayed, Tarek/0000-0001-8797-0541",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

By contrast, models fitted to non-target demersal species and pelagic species were unsatisfactory in terms of explained variability and predicting power. Large commercial size classes were better explained than the small size classes. Intervention analysis was used to identify the significance, magnitude and form of structural shifts (interventions) of the time series for each species. Most of the fitted interventions appeared in small commercial size classes and indicated a decrease in the mean level of the catch. Seasonality of demersal species, caught mainly by trawlers, was mainly attributed to changing availability and recruitment. By contrast, gear type explained the seasonal variation in landings of pelagic and some coastal species.

In this paper, the steps that should be followed in the development of such models are outlined. These include the choice of performance criteria, the division and pre-processing of the available data, the determination of appropriate model inputs and network architecture, optimisation of the connection weights (training) and model validation. The options available to modellers at each of these steps are discussed and the issues that should be considered are highlighted. A review of 43 papers dealing with the use of neural network models for the prediction and forecasting of water resources variables is undertaken in terms of the modelling process adopted. In all but two of the papers reviewed, feedforward networks are used. The vast majority of these networks are trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Issues in relation to the optimal division of the available data, data pre-processing and the choice of appropriate model inputs are seldom considered. In addition, the process of choosing appropriate stopping criteria and optimising network geometry and internal network parameters is generally described poorly or carried out inadequately. All of the above factors can result in non-optimal model performance and an inability to draw meaningful comparisons between different models. Future research efforts should be directed towards the development of guidelines which assist with the development of ANN models and the choice of when ANNs should be used in preference to alternative approaches, the assessment of methods for extracting the knowledge that is contained in the connection weights of trained ANNs and the incorporation of uncertainty into ANN models.

The role of experts is important because their judgments can provide valuable information, particularly in view of the limited availability of ""hard data"" regarding many important uncertainties in risk analysis. Because uncertainties are represented in terms of probability distributions in probabilistic risk analysis (PRA), we consider expert information in terms of probability distributions. The motivation for the use of multiple experts is simply the desire to obtain as much information as possible. Combining experts' probability distributions summarizes the accumulated information for risk analysts and decision-makers. Procedures for combining probability distributions are often compartmentalized as mathematical aggregation methods or behavioral approaches, and we discuss both categories. However, an overall aggregation process could involve both mathematical and behavioral aspects, and no single process is best in all circumstances. An understanding of the pros and cons of different methods and the key issues to consider is valuable in the design of a combination process for a specific PRA.

A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. The Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R-3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S-2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S-2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S-2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms. Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R-3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that g(i) and g(j) are radially symmetric functions defined on R-3 such that g(i) (x) = 0 for vertical bar x vertical bar > d(i) and g(j)(x) = 0 for vertical bar x vertical bar > d(j), 0 < d(i),d(j) <= where vertical bar.vertical bar denotes Euclidean distance in R-3. The parameters d(i) and d(j) are 'cut-off' distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions less than or equal to infinity, C-ij (x, y) := (g(i) *g(j))(x - y), i not equal j, and convolution covariance functions C-ii (x, y) := (g(i) * g(i))(x - y), vanishing for vertical bar x - y vertical bar > d(i) + d(j) and vertical bar x - y vertical bar > 2d(i), respectively. Additional covariance functions on R-3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R-3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form C(x, y) := C-0(vertical bar x - y vertical bar), x, y is an element of R-3, where the functions C-0(r) for r is an element of R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y is an element of S-2 approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S-2 x S-2.",,,,"Cohn, Stephen/K-1954-2012","Cohn, Stephen/0000-0001-8506-9354",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

DLMs use an adaptive fitting procedure to track trends in the rate of decline over time, in contrast to other approaches that fit fixed parameters. We used this method to make forecasts of PCB concentrations in these fishes, along with Bayesian credible-interval estimates associated with these forecasts. Point estimates of PCB concentrations in all five species show a decline through a 10-yr forecast horizon.

The networks of backpropagation type were trained on 7 years of weekly data for eight variables, and their ability to provide a 4-week forecast was evaluated for a 28-week period. They were relatively successful in providing a good forecast of both the incidence and magnitude of a growth peak of the cyanobacteria within the limits required for water quality monitoring. The use of lagged versus unlagged inputs was evaluated in the implementation and performance of the networks. Lagged inputs proved far superior in providing a fit to the actual data. Sensitivity analysis of input variables was performed to evaluate their relative significance in determining the forecast values. The analysis indicated that for this data set for the River Murray, flow and temperature were the predominant variables in determining the onset and duration of cyanobacterial growth. Water colour was the next most important variable in determining the magnitude of the population growth peak.

Applications in forecasting, signal processing and control require explicit treatment of dynamics. Feedforward networks can accommodate dynamics by including past input and target values in an augmented set of inputs. A much richer dynamic representation results from also allowing for internal network feedbacks. These types of network models are called recurrent network models and are used by Jordan (1986) for controlling and learning smooth robot movements, and by Elman (1990) for learning and representing temporal structure in linguistics. In Jordan's network, past values of network output feed back into hidden units; in Elman's network, past values of hidden units feed back into themselves. The main focus of this study is to investigate the relative forecast performance of the Elman type recurrent network models in comparison to feedforward networks with deterministic and noisy data. The salient property of the Elman type recurrent network architecture is that the hidden unit activation functions (internal states) are fed back at every time step to provide an additional input. This recurrence gives the network dynamical properties which make it possible for the network to have internal memory. Exactly how this memory is represented in the internal states is not determined in advance. Instead, the network must discover the underlying temporal structure of the task and learn to encode that structure internally. The simulation results of this paper indicate that recurrent networks filter noise more successfully than feedforward networks in small as well as large samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PHYSICA D,Physica D,15-Sep,1997,108,2-Jan,,,,,119,134,,10.1016/S0167-2789(97)82009-X,,,,"Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas; Physics, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Mathematical",,,WOS:A1997XW35800008,,,,,

Daily chlorophyll a (a measure of blue-green algal biomass) was correlated to some weather, physical, and grazing variables at lags ranging from 0 to 9 days. Conditions immediately preceding surface scums were variable, making predictions difficult. However, during surface scums, Secchi disk depth, wind velocity, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation were significantly different than when the scums were absent.

When present in large numbers, they can cause serious problems for domestic, industrial, agricultural and recreational users of water, as they can produce toxins and impart undesirable tastes and odours to water. It is important to understand the relationship between the incidence of algal populations and the prevailing environmental conditions in order to prevent algal blooms from occurring. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to model the incidence of a specific genus of cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp.) in the River Murray at Morgan, with the dual objectives of forecasting algal concentrations to give prior warning of impending blooms and to identify the factors that affect the blooms of Anabaena. The model inputs include weekly values of turbidity, colour, temperature, flow and the concentrations of total nitrogen, as well as soluble and total phosphorus. The results obtained are very promising as the model was able to forecast most major variations in Anabaena concentrations (timing and magnitude) for an eight-year period two weeks in advance.

In general, BES and, to a lesser extent, HES, NM ( which actually is an ARIMA (0,1,0)), EMP and HREG models were among the best performers more often, produced the worst forecasts more rarely and were generally characterised by the higher number of stable forecasts and of forecasts with MAPE < 20% and < 10%.

The scheme is based on a maximum-likelihood approach in which estimates are produced on the basis of a single batch of simultaneous observations. Single-sample covariance estimation is reasonable as long as the number of available observations exceeds the number of tunable parameters by two or three orders of magnitude. Not much is known at present about model error associated with actual forecast systems. Our scheme can be used to estimate some important statistical model error parameters such as regionally averaged variances or characteristic correlation length scales. The advantage of the single-sample approach is that it does not rely on any assumptions about the temporal behavior of the covariance parameters: time-dependent parameter estimates can be continuously adjusted on the basis of current observations. This is of practical importance since it is likely to be the case that both model error and observation error strongly depend on the actual state of the atmosphere. The single-sample estimation scheme can be incorporated into any four-dimensional statistical data assimilation system that involves explicit calculation of forecast error covariances, including optimal interpolation (OI) and the simplified Kalman filter (SKF). The computational cost of the scheme is high but not prohibitive: online estimation of one or two covariance parameters in each analysis box of an operational boxed-OI system is currently feasible. A number of numerical experiments performed with an adaptive SKF and an adaptive version of OI, using a linear two-dimensional shallow-water model and artificially generated model error are described. The performance of the nonadaptive versions of these methods turns out to depend rather strongly on the correct specification of model error parameters. These parameters are estimated under a variety of conditions, including uniformly distributed model error and time-dependent model error statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Incorrect model structure, parameter estimates, or both will result in unreliable model output. Spatially explicit models require knowledge of population spatial structure, dispersal, and movement rates, in addition to the usual demographic parameters and structural assumptions such as density-dependence, and are thus potentially very vulnerable to propagation of model uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis and validation can both be used to evaluate the reliability of SEPMs, but the level of spatiotemporal resolution at which the model should be evaluated is often not clear. Many SEPMs are very complex, and validation may only be possible or meaningful on a sub-model basis. Forecasting, that is, prediction under a different set of conditions than that under which the model was built, will provide a stronger test of model reliability. Forecasts from SEPMs can be used to generate hypotheses that can then be tested as parts of large-scale adaptive management experiments.

Moreover, it is shown how recent attempts to measure meaningful Lyapunov exponents for ecological data are fundamentally flawed, and that when observational noise is convolved with process noise, computing Lyapunov exponents for the real system will be difficult. Such problems pave the way for more operational definitions of dynamic complexity (cf. Yao and Tong, this volume). Aside from its use in the characterization of chaos, nonlinear forecasting can be used more broadly in pragmatic classification problems. Here I review a recent example of nonlinear forecasting as it is applied to classify human heart rhythms. In particular, it is shown how forecast nonlinearity can be a good discriminator of the physiological effects of age, and how prediction-decay may discriminate heart-disease.

It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

This second alternative is called deterministic chaos and the issue in this paper is to decide if actual plankton time series can vindicate the hypothesis of chaotic dynamics. The near-neighbor forecasting method is a recent technique for detecting determinism in a time series and we apply it to measurements of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass obtained at a single station in the Middle Atlantic Bight. Although the results do not conclude the presence of chaos, they do give some support to the idea that deterministic non-linear trophic dynamics may account for at least some of the variability that is seen in the data, particularly in terms of inferring zooplankton oscillations from those of phytoplankton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

J,"MURPHY, AH",,,,"MURPHY, AH",,,WHAT IS A GOOD FORECAST - AN ESSAY ON THE NATURE OF GOODNESS IN WEATHER FORECASTING,WEATHER AND FORECASTING,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Differences of opinion exist among forecasters-and between forecasters and users-regarding the meaning of the phrase ''good (bad) weather forecasts.'' These differences of opinion are fueled by a lack of clarity and/or understanding concerning the nature of goodness in weather forecasting. This lack of clarity and understanding complicates the processes of formulating and evaluating weather forecasts and undermines their ultimate usefulness. Three distinct types of goodness are identified in this paper: 1) the correspondence between forecasters' judgments and their forecasts (type 1 goodness, or consistency), 2) the correspondence between the forecasts and the matching observations (type 2 goodness, or quality), and 3) the incremental economic and/or other benefits realized by decision makers through the use of the forecasts (type 3 goodness, or value). Each type of goodness is defined and described in some detail. In addition, issues related to the measurement of consistency, quality, and value are discussed. Relationships among the three types of goodness are also considered. It is shown by example that the level of consistency directly impacts the levels of both quality and value. Moreover, recent studies of quality/value relationships have revealed that these relationships are inherently nonlinear and may not be monotonic unless the multifaceted nature of quality is respected. Some implications of these considerations for various practices related to operational forecasting are discussed. Changes in these practices that could enhance the goodness of weather forecasts in one or more respects are identified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WEATHER FORECAST,Weather Forecast.,JUN,1993,8,2,,,,,281,293,,10.1175/1520-0434(1993)008<0281:WIAGFA>2.0.CO;2,,,,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,WOS:A1993LL62700012,,,,,

Outliers in time series, depending on their nature, may have a moderate to significant impact on the effectiveness of the standard methodology for time series analysis with respect to model identification, estimation, and forecasting. In this article we use an iterative outlier detection and adjustment procedure to obtain joint estimates of model parameters and outlier effects. Four types of outliers are considered, and the issues of spurious and masking effects are discussed. The major differences between this procedure and those proposed in earlier literature include (a) the types and effects of outliers are obtained based on less contaminated estimates of model parameters, (b) the outlier effects are estimated simultaneously using multiple regression, and (c) the model parameters and the outlier effects are estimated jointly. The sampling behavior of the test statistics for cases of small to large sample sizes is investigated through a simulation study. The performance of the procedure is examined over a representative set of outlier cases. We find that the proposed procedure performs well in terms of detecting outlets and obtaining unbiased parameter estimates. An example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed procedure. It is demonstrated that this procedure performs effectively in avoiding spurious outliers and masking effects. The model parameter estimates obtained from the proposed procedure are typically very close to those estimated by the exact maximum likelihood method using an intervention model to incorporate the outliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J AM STAT ASSOC,J.

Using data compiled from the fish literature, I found a significant relationship (R2 0.90, p much less than 0.001, n 97) between the mean and interannual variance of stage-specific mortality rates that provided variance estimates for the model. The R2 values for the true correlation between abundances of small larvae and subsequent recruitment for four example species of marine fish were predicted to lie between 0.10 and 0.57, depending on the assumptions of the model. I therefore suggest that recruitment levels are fixed after the early-larval period. However, the precision of sample correlations are too low (10-yr data series) to empirically test whether abundances or mortality rates of early larvae are in reality strongly or poorly correlated with recruitment. After metamorphosis, the strength of the true relationship and the precision of sample correlations increase sufficiently to permit precise forecasting of recruitment. Recruitment is a complex process in which variation in all life stages contributes substantially to the variability in final abundance; therefore, researchers should recognize the importance of the later prerecruit stages and the interactions among all stages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FISH B-NOAA,Fish.

Climatic opportunities, in particular the number of field working days, need to be taken into consideration in the management of haymaking and the choice of harvesting equipment. Furthermore, the farmer's behaviour in response to short range weather forecasts and the uncertainty as to the drying requirements of a given forage should be taken into account. The authors propose to model drying opportunities and drying requirements according to the air saturation deficit sum. Drying requirements depend especially on the water content of the herbage. It is shown that drying requirements vary greatly from year to year. Paddocks with the higher yields have the greatest drying requirements. At a given date, the area cut depends not only on the forage characteristics but also on harvesting strategies (lapping or not of some paddocks) and on farmer behaviour in response to the weather forecast and forage drying requirements. The area cut at a given date is simulated according to these different assumptions and it is shown that the time needed for haymaking can fluctuate by about a month within one year. Haymaking strategy and behaviour towards the drying requirement of the forage are the most important. The results are compared with field data from different farmers over a range of years. The authors suggest, a process to integrate risk and uncertainty situations in respect of the choice of hay harvesting equipment and in respect of daily haymaking management. Also proposed are indicators with which to observe a set of decision making rules (risk level, the order in which to harvest paddocks).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGR SYST,Agric.

The model is used to determine the components of oxygen consumption and production-in particular, the SOD and carbon-to-chlorophyll (CCHL) ratio. It is found that SOD and algal respiration are major oxygen consumption items, and the CCHL ratio is much higher than reported in previous mathematical model studies.

Water-quality predictions are compared with well-documented field observations for both background and algal bloom conditions, over time scales on the order of a month.

Our work was initially inspired by previously published works that yielded inconsistent results about comparative performance. We have experimented with three time series of different complexity using different feed forward, backpropagation neural network models and the standard Box-Jenkins model. Our experiments demonstrate that for time series with long memory, both methods produced comparable results. However, for series with short memory, neural networks outperformed the Box-Jenkins model. We note that some of the comparable results arise since the neural network and time series model appear to be functionally similar models. We have found that for time series of different complexities there are optimal neural network topologies and parameters that enable them to learn more efficiently. Our initial conclusions are that neural networks are robust and provide good long-term forecasting. They are also parsimonious in their data requirements. Neural networks represent a promising alternative for forecasting, but there are problems determining the optimal topology and parameters for efficient learning.",,,,,"Tang, Zaiyong/0000-0002-1638-1165",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SIMULATION,Simulation,NOV,1991,57,5,,,,,303,310,,10.1177/003754979105700508,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,WOS:A1991GQ95900002,,,,,
