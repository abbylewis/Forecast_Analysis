1,274,The use of neural networks in the control of water quality,"In the treatment of raw water, to make it suitable for use as drinking-water, it is necessary to monitor and control colour as a key parameter of concern to the customer[1]. The ability to predict raw-water colour is a desirable feature in the optimisation of the treatment process. In order to remove this discoloration, a coagulant is added. The required dosage is affected by a combination of the six parameters: raw water colour, raw water pH, raw water turbidity, raw water conductivity, dosed water pH and raw water temperature. These six variables are continuously monitored, and may be used to predict the necessary setting for the coagulant flow valve. Raw-water colour is inherently non-linear as a time series relationship, arid it is difficult to achieve accurate modeling with conventional time series modeling techniques. This paper considers a number of possible methods including multiple regression, subtractive fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks (ANNs). From this prediction it is possible to calculate the required dose of coagulant to eliminate the discoloration. Results show that the ANN modeling scheme is as good as the other methods in forecasting the raw-water colour in river water, and lends itself to the design of an ANN controller for dispensing the appropriate dose of coagulant[2].",NA,"Waterworth, G",2000,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,mary lofton,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,1,
2,123,Development of a Oak Pollen Emission and Transport Modeling Framework in South Korea,"Pollen is closely related to health issues such as allergenic rhinitis and asthma as well as intensifying atopic syndrome. Information on current and future spatio-temporal distribution of allergenic pollen is needed to address such issues. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling (CMAQ) was utilized as a base modeling system to forecast pollen dispersal from oak trees. Pollen emission is one of the most important parts in the dispersal modeling system. Areal emission factor was determined from gridded areal fraction of oak trees, which was produced by the analysis of the tree type maps (1: 5000) obtained from the Korea Forest Service. Daily total pollen production was estimated by a robust multiple regression model of weather conditions and pollen concentration. Hourly emission factor was determined from wind speed and friction velocity. Hourly pollen emission was then calculated by multiplying areal emission factor, daily total pollen production, and hourly emission factor. Forecast data from the KMA UM LDAPS (Korea Meteorological Administration Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System) was utilized as input. For the verification of the model, daily observed pollen concentration from 12 sites in Korea during the pollen season of 2014. Although the model showed a tendency of over-estimation in terms of the seasonal and daily mean concentrations, overall concentration was similar to the observation. Comparison at the hourly output showed distinctive delay of the peak hours by the model at the 'Pocheon' site. It was speculated that the constant release of hourly number of pollen in the modeling framework caused the delay.",https://doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2015.25.2.221,"Lim, YK; Kim, KR; Cho, C; Kim, M; Choi, HS; Han, MJ; Oh, I; Kim, BJ",2015,Article,Atmos.-Korea,Korean,mary lofton,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,paper is in korean,1,
3,384,Improving the accuracy and utility of harmful algal bloom forecasting systems,"One of the goals of harmful algal bloom (HAB) research has been to develop predictive capabilities for blooms. Major steps have been made towards this goal, including the development of physical-biological models of HAB species that simulate bloom dynamics in specific regions. In the Gulf of Maine region of the northeastern US, models have been developed that have considerable skill in simulating blooms of Alexandrium fundyense, the causative organism for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks in the region. This model is now being used for both short-term and long-term forecasts. This paper describes several ongoing activities that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the model and forecasts. These include efforts to streamline or minimize the sampling and analysis requirements of annual A. fundyense cyst surveys, efforts to quantitatively describe or characterize the severity of predicted outbreaks and plans to obtain real-time data on Alexandrium cell abundance and toxicity that can be assimilated into the models. Together, these and other activities are moving us towards an operational forecasting system for Alexandrium blooms in the region.",NA,"Anderson, DM; Keafer, BA; McGillicuddy, DJ; Solow, AR; Kleindinst, JL",2013,Article; Book Chapter,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,NA,1,0,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,1,Not a forecast
4,470,A Comparison of ANN Architecture towards Predicting Cyanobacteria Abundance at Tropical Lake and Wetlands,"Algal blooms are becoming increasingly prevalent and serious water quality issues worldwide. Algal bloom events at water resources can cause taste and odor problems, damage the environment, and some algal classes like Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) which release toxins in water may lead to serious diseases or cause fatalities to human. Thus there is a need to develop computational models that can accurately forecast algal bloom which in turns provides valuable lead time for lake and reservoir management to take the necessary correction or preventive actions. This research focused on the feasibility of using artificial neural network (ANN) technology as a modeling and forecasting tool for Cyanobacteria. It also presents a thorough study on the co-relationship of system accuracy with the deployment of different ANN architectures namely Generalized Feed-Forward (GFF), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Recurrent Artificial Neural network (RNN). Historical data collected from tropical Putrajaya Lake and Wetlands served as the test case and the system accuracy is measured in terms of its root means square error (RMSE). The results indicate that the RMSE values are within acceptable range of 105 to 120 (cell/ml) whereby the model developed using RBF architecture out performed slightly better than other models. The high predictive accuracy indicates that with sufficient data, both in terms of the number of historical algal bloom events and availability of important predictor data, ANNs can serve as reliable, forecasting tools.",https://doi.org/10.3850/978-981-08-5716-5_T266,"Oh, JH; Malek, S; Ahmad, SMS; Salleh, A",2010,Proceedings Paper,NA,English,rachel corrigan,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,requested via illiad,1,
5,160,Improvement and Evaluation of Emission Formulas in UM-CMAQ-Pollen Model,"For the allergy patient who needs to know the situation about the extent of pollen risk, the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences developed a pollen forecasting system based on the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling (CMAQ). In the old system, pollen emission from the oak was estimated just based on the airborne concentration and meteorology factors, resulted in high uncertainty. For improving the quality of current pollen forecasting system, therefore the estimation of pollen emission is now corrected based on the observation of pollen emission at the oak forest to better reflect the real emission pattern. In this study, the performance of the previous (NIMS2014) and current (NIMS2016) model system was compared using observed oak pollen concentration. Daily pollen concentrations and emissions were simulated in pollen season 2016 and accuracy of onset and end of pollen season were evaluated. In the NIMS2014 model, pollen season was longer than actual pollen season; The simulated pollen season started 6 days earlier and finished 13.25 days later than the actual pollen season. The NIMS2016 model, however, the simulated pollen season started only 1.83 days later, and finished 0.25 days later than the actual pollen season, showing the improvement to predict the temporal range of pollen events. Also, the NIMS2016 model shows better performance for the prediction of pollen concentration, while there is a still large uncertainty to capture the maximum pollen concentration at the target site. Continuous efforts to correct these problems will be required in the future.",https://doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2019.29.1.001,"Kim, TH; Seo, YA; Kim, KR; Cho, C; Han, MJ",2019,Article,Atmos.-Korea,Korean,mary lofton,NA,99,99,99,NA,abby lewis,In korean,1,
