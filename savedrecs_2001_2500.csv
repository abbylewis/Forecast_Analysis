Modelling studies have suggested that increased variance may foreshadow a regime shift, but this requires long-term data and knowledge of the functional links between key processes. Field-based research and ground-truthing is an essential part of the heuristic that marries theoretical and empirical research, but experimental studies of resilience are lagging behind theory, management and policy requirements. Empirically, ecological resilience must be understood in terms of community dynamics and the potential for small shifts in environmental forcing to break the feedbacks that support resilience. Here, we integrate recent theory and empirical data to identify ways we might define and understand potential thresholds in the resilience of nature, and thus the potential for regime shifts, by focusing on the roles of strong and weak interactions, linkages in meta-communities, and positive feedbacks between these and environmental drivers. The challenge to theoretical and field ecologists is to make the shift from hindsight to a more predictive science that is able to assist in the implementation of ecosystem-based management.",,,,"Norkko, Alf/K-2341-2019; Norkko, Alf/L-8736-2019; Norkko, Alf/A-1856-2012","Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Coco, Giovanni/0000-0001-7435-1602; Thrush, Simon/0000-0002-4005-3882","FRSTNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C01X0501]; Marie Curie International Incoming FellowshipEuropean Union (EU); Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [110999, 114076]","This work was supported by FRST C01X0501 and a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship to SFT.

To date, community-level changes have been poorly documented, owing, in part, to the paucity of long-term datasets. To circumvent this, the use of 'space-for-time' substitution-the forecasting of temporal trends from spatial climatic gradients-has increasingly been adopted, often with little empirical support. Here we examine changes from 1975 to 2001 in three community attributes (species richness, body mass and occupancy) for 404 assemblages of terrestrial winter avifauna in North America containing a total of 227 species. We examine the accuracy of space-for-time substitution and assess causal associations between community attributes and observed changes in annual temperature using a longitudinal study design. Annual temperature and all three community attributes increased over time. The trends for the three community attributes differed significantly from the spatially derived predictions, although richness showed broad congruence. Correlations with trends in temperature were found with richness and body mass. In the face of rapid climate change, applying space-for-time substitution as a predictive tool could be problematic with communities developing patterns not reflected by spatial ecological associations.",,,,"La Sorte, Frank/A-2849-2009","Jetz, Walter/0000-0002-1971-7277",National Audubon Society; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-0648733],"We thank H.

A system was constructed to predict the likelihood of the presence of V. cholerae in surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay, with the goal to provide forecasts of the occurrence of this and related pathogenic Vibrio spp. Prediction was achieved by driving an available multivariate empirical habitat model estimating the probability of V. cholerae within a range of temperatures and salinities in the Bay, with hydrodynamically generated predictions of ambient temperature and salinity. The experimental predictions provided both an improved understanding of the in situ variability of V. cholerae, including identification of potential hotspots of occurrence, and usefulness as an early warning system.

To do this, the species-area relationship (SAR) is frequently used. That relationship assumes random patterns of habitat loss and species distributions. In nature, however, species distribution patterns are usually nonrandom, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Likewise, socioeconomic and environmental factors influence habitat loss and are not randomly distributed across landscapes. We used a recently developed SAR model that accounts for nonrandomness to predict rates of bird species loss in fragmented forests of the Panama Canal region, an area that was historically covered in forest but now has 53% forest cover. Predicted species loss was higher than that predicted by the standard SAR. Furthermore, a species loss threshold was evident when remaining forest cover declined by 25%. This level of forest cover corresponds to 40% of the historical forest cover, and our model predicts rapid species loss past that threshold. This study illustrates the importance of considering patterns of species distributions and realistic habitat loss scenarios to develop better estimates of losses in species richness. Forecasts of tropical biodiversity loss generated from simple species-area relationships may underestimate actual losses because nonrandom patterns of species distributions and habitat loss are probably not unique to the Panama Canal region.",,,,"Desrochers, Andre/B-6248-2008","Desrochers, Andre/0000-0002-5676-964X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This study was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, via a Ph.D. fellowship to G.

We explored these aspects for a coral reef system in Moorea, French Polynesia, involving intraguild predation where the shared damselfish prey (juvenile yellowtail dascyllus Dascyllus flavicaudus) and two species of intraguild (IG) prey (the ambush predators arc-eye hawkfish Paracirrhites arcatus and red-spotted coral crab Trapezia rufopunctata) shelter together in branching Pocilloporid corals for protection from mobile IG predators. Field experiments revealed that both IG prey had strong adverse effects on survivorship of juvenile damselfish, but that the dominant underlying process was competition for enemy-free space and not direct consumption. In this case, the combined effect of hawkfish and crabs did not result in either risk enhancement or risk reduction for the damselfish. Similarly, the combined influence of IG predators and IG prey on the shared prey also was indistinguishable from that expected from their independent effects. Habitat structure weakened the IG-prey-IG-predator interaction; IG prey were much stronger space competitors with damselfish than resource competitors with IG predators. As a consequence, there was not a trophic cascade where damselfish benefited by the adverse effect of IG predators on hawkfish or coral crabs. These results highlight the manner by which habitat structure can mediate species interactions and emphasize the need to understand the underlying mechanisms.",,,,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 9910677, OCE 04-17412]; W.

CEMs are used to examine veiled evolutionary questions about extinctions, locations of past refugia and migration pathways, or to propose hypotheses concerning the past population structure of species in phylogeographical studies. CEMs are sensitive to theoretical assumptions, to model classes and to projections in non-analogous climates, among other issues. Studies hindcasting the climatic niches of species often make reference to these limitations. However, to obtain strong scientific inferences, we must not only be aware of these potential limitations but we must also overcome them. Here, I review the literature on hindcasting CEMs. I discuss the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling, i.e. the stability of climatic niches through time and the equilibrium of species with climate. I also summarize a set of 'recommended practices' to improve hindcasting. The studies reviewed: (1) rarely test the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling such as the stability of species climatic niches through time and the equilibrium of species with climate; (2) they only use one model class (72% of the studies) and one palaeoclimatic reconstruction (62.5%) to calibrate their models; (3) they do not check for the occurrence of non-analogous climates (97%); and (4) they do not use independent data to validate the models (72%). Ignoring the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling and using inadequate methods for hindcasting CEMs may well entail a cascade of errors and naive ecological and evolutionary inferences.

In other words, nature supplies us with a functionality that we would otherwise have to pay for. Our cost would be to provide resources either (1) to ensure the necessary inputs to drive our society, or (2) to assist in counteracting, absorbing or remediating unwanted effects that are results of our societal activities. Through ecosystem studies it has been found that a substantial part of the functionality of nature is laid out in all types of components-the compartments of the ecosystems together with the transactional interrelations (flows) and controls between them. Eventually, many so-called indicators have been proposed during the last decades. Such measures are dedicated to tell us about the quality side of ecosystem functionality, e.g. to tell us how well the system performs relatively to a theoretical maximum efficiency possible. As an additional hypothesis, such functions are thought to orient the systems and thus increase through time development, i.e. to be optimised under the given the constraints, through the evolution of the system. Recently is has been pointed out that natural and societal systems share the feature of being complex in their organisation. Meanwhile, it was remarked that societal systems in many ways evolved in opposite direction of how natural evolution would drive an ecosystem. Many philosophers of biology have stated that biological systems posses information and memory functions which improve their long-term capability to survive. This information is believed to be contained in the organisational structures of the system as much as in its gene pool. If we accept such arguments it means that studies of organisation and function of natural systems will provide us with another type of ecosystem services. This would namely give us information about in what direction to drive society in order to achieve a more sustainable system. This paper discusses what measures derived from modern ecosystem theory can possibly be used to study and compare the functionality of the two types of systems. The discussion takes an entrance point in two graphs-one that represents a natural system and one of a socio-economic system. The systems possess similar levels of complexity in terms of number of compartments whereas their connectivities do differ in quantity and quality. The differences between the systems are compared from both a network and a thermodynamic perspective. Indications of the best available options that we have at present, will help to increase our knowledge about and understanding of the systems given. As a main conclusion it is possible to view and treat our society as an ecosystem. This means that it is possible to apply the same measures (indicators) that we use in ecological theory. The idea to use these features is so clear, obvious and at the same time cheap that this option necessarily has to be tried out. It seems a bit surprising that we - from a ""natural science point-of-view"" - to a certain extent understand natural systems better than socio-economic ones. One major reason is that the latter type includes a large set of regulatory mechanisms that are exerted on a subjective basis as opposed to natural systems. As a consequence societal systems become much more difficult to evaluate, forecast and regulate than ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Soares, WL; Porto, MFD",,,,"Soares, Wagner Lopes; de Souza Porto, Marcelo Firpo",,,Estimating the social cost of pesticide use: An assessment from acute poisoning in Brazil,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pesticides; Poisonings; External costs; Social cost; Cost-benefit,FARMER HEALTH; EXPOSURE,"The intensive use of pesticides in countries like Brazil has ignored structural and institutional shortfalls, such as the lack of workforce training for the new, difficult to implement technologies, and the institutional vulnerability of the environmental protection, health, and safety sectors. As a result we have ""invisible"" or social, environmental and health costs which end up being socialised with the farmer, in general, having no incentives to recognise and internalise them. This study is intended to review and develop this problem in the light of the Brazilian reality. To this end, we make use of an empirical exercise to illustrate estimation of the social cost associated with acute poisoning by pesticide using the PREVS/IBGE data (Harvest Forecast Research) in the state of Parana, Brazil. The results suggest that, for maize, the costs of acute poisoning could represent 64% of the benefits of using herbicides and insecticides. and, in the best of hypotheses, when some risk factors are eliminated, they may reach 8% of the benefits of the use of these products. Similarly, when we examine future scenarios for five and ten years, we find less encouraging results, as in ten years the costs of acute poisoning could reach around 85% of the benefit of using insecticides and herbicides for maize. However. there is the encouraging news that, if preventive measures were taken during this time, the gains would be considerable, about 6.5 times greater. We conclude that an assessment of the real benefits involved with pesticides in Brazil is required, principally in regard to the smallholder, where farmers need more training in the use - or even the elimination - of these hazardous substances. There are sustainable technological options available which are economically efficient, especially if we consider the social, environmental and health costs. In this context it is worth highlighting the role of regulatory measures as a mechanism which can reorient generation of negative external costs through the reduction of current incentives in the socialisation of private costs.

How will climate change influence these climate variables and thereby affect the occurrence of fire and area burned in a deciduous forest landscape in Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada? Location: West central Quebec and the Great Lakes-St Lawrence forest of Canada. Methods: We first used an information-theoretic framework to evaluate the relative role of different weather variables in explaining occurrence and area burned of large fires (>200 ha, 1959-1999) across the Great Lakes-St Lawrence forest region. Second, we examined how these weather variables varied historically in Temiscamingue and, third, how they may change between the present and 2100 according to different scenarios of climate change based on two Global Circulation Models. Results: Mean monthly temperature maxima during the fire season (Apr-Oct) and weighted sequences of dry spells best explained fire occurrence and area burned. Between 1910 and 2004, mean monthly temperature maxima in Temiscamingue showed no apparent temporal trend, while dry spell sequences decreased in frequency and length. All future scenarios show an increase in mean monthly temperature maxima, and one model scenario forecasts an increase in dry spell sequences, resulting in a slight increase in forecasted annual area burned. Conclusion: Despite the forecasted increase in fire activity, effects of climate change on fire will not likely affect forest structure and composition as much as natural succession or harvesting and other disturbances, principally because or the large relative difference in area affected by these processes",,,,"Flannigan, Michael/G-6996-2015","Flannigan, Michael/0000-0002-9970-5363",Ouranos Consortium; NSERC/UQAT/UQAM Industrial Chair in Sustainable Forest ManagementNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Resources Canada Climate Change Action FundNatural Resources Canada; Fondation Marie-Victorin pour la science et la nature; Groupe de Recherche en Ecologie Forestiere Interuniversitaire; UQAM Faculte des sciences,"The authors thank Marc Mazerolle for his assistance with R programming.

Interdiction efforts are being conducted on Guam and some of the potential receiving sites, but no tools exist for evaluating the potential for snake incursion; thus, the amount of effort that should be invested in protecting particular sites is unknown. We devised a model that predicts the relative risk of establishment of the brown tree snake (BTS) at a given site. To calculate overall risk, we incorporated in the model information on the likelihood of an organism entering the transportation system, avoiding detection, surviving to arrive at another location, and establishing at the receiving end. On the basis of documented rates of snake arrival at receiving sites, the model produced realistic predictions of invasion risk. Model outputs can thus be used to prioritize interdiction efforts to focus on especially vulnerable receiving locations. We provide examples of the utility of the model in evaluating the impacts of changes in transportation parameters. Finally, the model can be used to evaluate the impacts that BTS establishment at an additional site and that creation of a new source of snakes would have. The use of qualitative inputs allows the model to be adapted by substituting data on other invasive species or transportation systems.",,,,,,U.S. Department of Interior; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas Tech University,"We thank G.

Species richness and Shannon's index were positively correlated with accumulated precipitation in the growing season and both variables were negatively affected by reduced water availability in drought plots. The relative abundance of the different species in both treatments was linearly correlated with their relative abundance in control plots. Moreover, we found species-specific responses to treatments. Drought and warming treatment reduced the competitive ability of the obligate seeder tree Pinus halepensis against native resprouter shrubs and consequently, the transformation from shrub to pine tree dominated vegetation was slowed down. Conversely, the water use strategy of Globularia alypum may allow this species to maintain a dominant position in drought plots. Therefore, future drier and warmer conditions in Mediterranean areas may severely affect plant community recovery after a disturbance, due to the existence of both abundance-dependent and species-specific responses that may change inter-specific competitive relationships.",,,,"Lloret, Francisco/H-2711-2015; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Llorens, Laura/L-8732-2014; Estiarte, Marc/G-2001-2016","Lloret, Francisco/0000-0002-9836-4069; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Llorens, Laura/0000-0001-9190-5144; Estiarte, Marc/0000-0003-1176-8480","EUEuropean Union (EU) [ENV4-CT97-0694]; VULCAN [EVK2-CT-2000-00094]; Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2006-04025/BOS, CSD2008-00040]; Catalan Government [SGR2005-00312]; European project ALARM [506675]; Fundacion Banco Bilbao Vizcaya","We owe thanks to Paula Bruna for providing her data and also to Marta Ribera, Balma Gonzalez, Vanesa Cruz, Rosa Marin, Patricia Mendoza, Jordi Munoz, Elena Quintanilla and Neus Sanfeliu for their help in the collection of the data.

Human land use and the loss of native habitats is thought to be an important driver of decline for wild, native pollinators, yet the findings of published studies on this topic have never been quantitatively synthesized. Here we use meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on how bees, the most important group of pollinators, are affected by human disturbances such as habitat loss, grazing, logging, and agriculture. We obtained 130 effect sizes from 54 published studies recording bee abundance and/or species richness as a function of human disturbance. Both bee abundance and species richness were significantly, negatively affected by disturbance. However, the magnitude of the effects was not large. Furthermore, the only disturbance type showing a significant negative effect, habitat loss and fragmentation, was statistically significant only in systems where very little natural habitat remains. Therefore, it would be premature to draw conclusions about habitat loss having caused global pollinator decline without first assessing the extent to which the existing studies represent the status of global ecosystems.

The objective was to assess the role of recruitment as a determinant of the production dynamics of stream-resident brown trout (Salmo trutta) across replicate habitats of contrasting quality and population attributes. A total of 128-year-classes (YC) at 12 stream sites were examined along four tributaries of the Rio Esva drainage (northwestern Spain). 2. A meta-comparison revealed that growth, density, mortality and production were essentially site-specific. However, when all data were pooled, recruitment (as a delayed density-dependent process) affected both growth and mortality in a way such that individuals in YC with high recruitment grew less and had higher mortality. 3. The value of total YC production recorded covered the global range of variation in the production of stream salmonids reported in the literature. Linear regressions of log-transformed data revealed that 89.0%, 58.9% and 70.7% of the variation in YC density, biomass and production, respectively, were explained by variations in recruitment. 4. The inclusion of growth and mortality, together with recruitment, into a multiple regression increased the variance explained of the total YC production by 13.3%, from 70.7% to 84.0%. 5.

The objective of this paper was to characterize the relationship between interannual variation of annual and seasonal Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI), as a surrogate for ANPP, and precipitation in the steppes of Northern Patagonia. In 11 sites encompassing a wide range of conditions and vegetation physiognomies, we studied a 20-year monthly data set of NDVI and precipitation. We took into account the precipitation of current, as well as previous periods of variable length. Interannual variation of annual NDVI was little correlated with annual precipitation, either current or previous. In contrast, it was highly and widely correlated with precipitation accumulated during a few months of the previous growing season. Interannual variation of seasonal NDVI was little correlated With Current seasonal precipitation. In contrast, it was significantly correlated with precipitation accumulated during previous periods of variable length according to the season and site under consideration. NDVI was more tightly coupled with precipitation in drier ecosystems. Lags of response between NDVI and precipitation provide an opportunity for forecasting ANPP and suggest even longer lags between climatic variation and herbivore performance.

The loss of large hollow-bearing trees coupled with inadequate recruitment of mature ash forest has been predicted to result in a reduction in population size of up to 90% by 2020. Furthermore, bioclimatic analyses have suggested additional reductions in the species' distribution under a variety of climate change scenarios. Using a panel of 15 highly resolving microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control region sequence data, we infer past and present gene flow. Populations in the northern part of the core range were highly admixed, and showed no signs of either current or historical barriers to gene flow. A marginal, isolated and inbred population at Yellingbo was highly genetically differentiated, both in terms of current and historic genetic structure. Sequence data confirmed the conclusions from earlier genetic simulation studies that the Yellingbo population has been isolated from the rest of the species range since before European-induced changes to the montane landscape, and formed part of a larger genetic unit that is now otherwise extinct. Historic loss of maternal lineages in the Central Highlands of Victoria was detected despite signals of immigration, indicating population declines that most probably coincided with changes in climate at the end of the Pleistocene. Given ongoing habitat loss and the recent (February 2009) wildfire in the Central Highlands, we forecast (potentially extensive) demographic declines, in line with predicted range reductions under climate change scenarios.",,,,"Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017; Taylor, Andrea/B-5795-2009","Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; Hansen, Birgita/0000-0003-3608-7622",Australian Academy of Sciences Research Award; Holsworth Wildlife Foundation Research,"We are very grateful to the Museum of Victoria for making available samples from specimens lodged in their collections, especially the two type specimens.

To test whether differences in decomposer growth can forecast the amount of N species acquire from plant litter, as suggested by theory, we grew individuals of three grassland plants-Holcus lanatus, Plantago lanceolata and Lotus corniculatus-in soils into which (15)N-labelled litter of either Holcus, Plantago or Lotus was added. We measured the effects of live roots and litter of each species on soil microbes and their protozoan and nematode feeders, and to link decomposer growth and plant nutrient uptake, we measured the amount of N taken up by plants from the added litter. We hypothesised that those species that induce the highest growth of microbes, and especially that of microbial feeders, will also take up the highest amount of N from the litter. We found, however, that although numbers of bacterial-feeding Protozoa and nematodes were on average lower after addition of Holcus than Plantago or Lotus litter, N uptake was higher from Holcus litter. Further, although the effects on Protozoa and bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes did not differ between the live plants, litter-N uptake differed, with Holcus being the most efficient compared to Plantago and Lotus. Hence, although microbes and their feeders unquestionably control N mineralization in the soil, and their growth differs among plant species, these differences cannot predict differences in litter-N uptake among plant species. A likely reason is that for nutrient uptake, other species-specific plant traits, such as litter chemistry, root proliferation ability and competitiveness for soil N, override in significance the species-specific ability of plants to induce decomposer growth.",,,,"Mikola, Juha/A-1630-2015; Ekelund, Flemming/M-1731-2014","Mikola, Juha/0000-0002-4336-2648; Ekelund, Flemming/0000-0002-2144-7659",EUEuropean Union (EU),This study is a part of the EU-funded project Biotic Interactions in the Rhizosphere as Structuring Forces for Plant Communities (BIORHIZ).

Location One-thousand one-hundred and ten stream sections in France. Methods We predicted the future potential distribution of 35 common stream fish species facing changes in temperature and precipitation regime. Seven different species distribution models were applied and a consensus forecast was produced to limit uncertainty between single-models. The potential impacts of climate change on fish assemblages were assessed using both species and biological trait approaches. We then addressed the spatial distribution of potential impacts along the upstream-downstream gradient. Results Overall, climate change was predicted to result in an increase in species and trait diversity. Species and trait composition of the fish assemblages were also projected to be highly modified. Changes in assemblages' diversity and composition differed strongly along the upstream-downstream gradient, with upstream and midstream assemblages more modified than downstream assemblages. We also predicted a global increase in species and trait similarity between pairwise assemblages indicating a future species and trait homogenization of fish assemblages. Nevertheless, we found that upstream assemblages would differentiate, whereas midstream and downstream assemblages would homogenize. Our results suggested that colonization could be the main driver of the predicted homogenization, while local extinctions could result in assemblage differentiation. Main conclusions This study demonstrated that climate change could lead to contrasted impacts on fish assemblage structure and diversity depending on the position along the upstream-downstream gradient. These results could have important implications in terms of ecosystem monitoring as they could be useful in establishing areas that would need conservation prioritization.",,,,"Grenouillet, Gael/C-8710-2011; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019",,EUEuropean Union (EU) [GOEC-CT-2003-505540],"This research was part of the EU project Euro-Limpacs (contract number GOEC-CT-2003-505540).

Model input variables were derived from two load estimation methods, the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation (AMLE) and the composite (COMP) method, developed by the U. S. Geological Survey. Variability in midsummer hypoxic area was described by models that incorporated May discharge, May nitrate, and February TP concentrations or their spring (discharge and nitrate) and winter (TP) averages. The regression models predicted the observed hypoxic area within +/-30%, yet model residuals showed an increasing trend with time. An additional model variable, Epoch, which allowed post-1993 observations to have a different intercept than earlier observations, suggested that hypoxic area has been 6450 km(2) greater per unit discharge and nutrients since 1993. Model forecasts predicted that a dual 45% reduction in nitrate and TP concentration would likely reduce hypoxic area to approximately 5000 km(2), the coastal goal established by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. However, the COMP load estimation method, which is more accurate than the AMLE method, resulted in a smaller predicted hypoxia response to any given nutrient reduction than models based on the AMLE method. Monte Carlo simulations predicted that five years after an instantaneous 50% nitrate reduction or dual 45% nitrate and TP reduction it would be possible to resolve a significant reduction in hypoxic area. However, if nutrient reduction targets were achieved gradually (e. g., over 10 years), much more than a decade would be required before a significant downward trend in both nutrient concentrations and hypoxic area could be resolved against the large background of interannual variability. The multiple regression models and statistical approaches applied provide improved capabilities for evaluating dual nutrient management strategies to address Gulf hypoxia and a clearer perspective on the strengths and limitations of approaching the problem using regression models.",,,,"Greene, Richard/G-9685-2013",,U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"The authors appreciate the advice and assistance of Brent Aulenbach (USGS) on the load estimation methodologies.

Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences.

Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.",,,,,"Baum, Julia/0000-0002-9827-1612",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The authors express their gratitude to the late R.A.

Sudden eruption of invading populations from low to high abundance may be viewed as a regime shift from one alternative state to another. Previous research proposed several types of early warning signals to predict regime shifts in ecological systems such as polluted lakes and semiarid grasslands. This paper explores theoretically the potential of such indicators in predicting demographic regime shifts of invading populations. I analyzed a stochastic differential equation model for the population dynamics of an invasive species subject to Allee effects and propagule pressure. Diffusion approximation to the stochastic model suggests that persistent propagule pressure makes demographic regime shifts inevitable, but Allee effects can lengthen the mean time until regime shifts virtually indefinitely. To compare the potential of indicators, I examined standard deviation, skewness, and estimated return rates of longitudinal population abundance. I found that standard deviation showed a distinct increase as regime shifts became more likely, but skewness and return rates showed no clear trends. This result suggests that standard deviation might be a useful warning signal for forecasting an impending demographic regime shift of invading populations during the period when their abundance is still low.",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19870022]",I thank comments from A.

The case studied is the chlorophyll response as bioindicator of ecological status in the Northeast coastal upwelling system of Rio de Janeiro state, Southeastern of Brazil. The prediction of the fuzzy model has shown an improved performance when compared to the traditional approaches as Multiple Regression modelling. The results show that the set of inferred rules can assess three different water masses. Despite the increased occurrence of upwelling is observed in spring-summer period and some instability of the model, it is able to forecast some chlorophyll peaks.

However, the area only recently received full legal protection as a National Park and currently few resources are available to enforce that legislation. With rapid economic development forecast for the island, active conservation efforts are essential. Here we study the distribution and density of the island's endemic bird species, including nine that are Globally Threatened, within the National Park. Sites, covering the full range of primary forest types, were surveyed using distance sampling methods. No introduced species were observed. The highest number of species, including eight Globally Threatened species, were found in lowland rainforest, although many were infrequently encountered. Higher altitude sites were less diverse, but supported some of the common endemic species at extremely high densities. The least diverse assemblage, with generally lower species population densities, occurred at the most accessible mid-altitude forest site. Distance from settlements was a key explanatory variable for the presence of all Globally Threatened species, indicating that human habitation has negative effects on the suitability of nearby forest habitats. This suggests that, as infrastructure improvements proceed, populations of endangered species will come under growing pressure. Integrating the needs of biodiversity conservation and development represents a major challenge for many biodiverse countries and on Sao TomE, as elsewhere, may best be achieved by preserving the still intact functioning forest ecosystem.",,,,"Dallimer, Martin/I-1547-2019","Dallimer, Martin/0000-0001-8120-3309; King, Tony/0000-0003-4597-0134",Davis Expedition Fund of The University of Edinburgh; British Ecological Society; John Ray Trust and the Carnegie Trust; Garmin (Europe) Ltd; Berghaus Ltd,"We thank the staff of ECOFAC Sao TomE and Principe for their help in carrying out the fieldwork.

An autonomous platform (the Automatic Water Quality Monitoring Station) moored in a Mediterranean reservoir provided minute-by-minute records of wind speed and the phytoplankton fluorescence during winter and summer. This information was then used here to quantify the impact of short-term changes in the weather on the vertical distribution of diatoms and cyanobacteria. Additionally, we apply an empirical model to determine the extent of entrainment of diatoms and cyanobacteria within the turbulent upper layers of the water column. During winter, the surface time series of fluorescence was positively correlated with the short-term variations in wind speed. In contrast, during the summer, fluorescence was negatively correlated with wind speed. In the latter case, turbulence overcame the flotation velocity of buoyant cyanobacteria, thus homogenizing their vertical distribution and decreasing surface biomass. In both cases, the dynamic response of surface phytoplankton biomass to short-term changes in wind stress was rapid, within the minute scale. As far as we know from the literature, this is the first study in which the interaction between wind stress and surface phytoplankton fluorescence has been quantified on such a fine temporal scale.

The investigation of causal factors, which command the disease dynamics in rodent populations, is a crucial step to forecast, control and anticipate the infection extension to humans. This paper presents simulation results obtained from an epidemic model, SIMPEST, designed to simulate bubonic plague in a rodent population at a high level of spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a structurally realistic individual-based model, mobilizing knowledge about fleas and rats behaviour, inter-individual plague transmission, and disease evolution in individual organisms, so that the model reflects the way the real system operates and to generate spatial and temporal patterns of disease spread. To assess the structural validity of our simulations, we perform sensitivity analyses on the initial population size and spatial distribution, and compare our results with theoretical statements, garnered from both previous modelling experiences and repeated field observations. We show our results are consistent with referents about population size conditions for a disease to invade and persist and the effect of the contact network on disease dynamics.

This study relates the seed bank densities of species of Taxodium distichum swamps to local water regime and regional climate factors at five latitudes across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley from southern Illinois to Louisiana. In an outdoor nursery setting, the seed banks of twenty-five swamps were exposed to non-flooded (freely drained) or flooded treatments, and the number and species of seeds germinating were recorded from each swamp during one growing season. Based on ANOVA analysis, the majority of dominant species had a higher rate of germination in non-flooded versus flooded treatments. Similarly, an NMS comparison, which considered the local water regime and regional climate of the swamps, found that the species of seeds germinating, almost completely shifted under non-flooded versus flooded treatments. For example, in wetter northern swamps, seeds of Taxodium distichum germinated in non-flooded conditions, but did not germinate from the same seed banks in flooded conditions. In wetter southern swamps, seeds of Eleocharis cellulosa germinated in flooded conditions, but did not germinate in non-flooded conditions. The strong relationship of seed germination and density relationships with local water regime and regional climate variables suggests that the forecasting of climate change effects on swamps and other wetlands needs to consider a variety of interrelated variables to make adequate projections of the regeneration responses of species to climate change. Because regeneration is an important aspect of species maintenance and restoration, climate drying could influence the species distribution of these swamps in the future.",,,,"Middleton, Beth/D-1778-2014","Middleton, Beth/0000-0002-1220-2326",United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey [8343-9HC4F],"This project was funded by the United States Geological Survey (8343-9HC4F).

We have focused our analysis on the round goby (Apollonia metanostoma). a globally distributed invasive forage fish. By integrating bioenergetics with a bioaccumulation model, we illustrate how life history characteristics interact to influence contaminant accumulation. We use uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to assess how the model output is affected by uncertainty and variability in model parameters. We then demonstrate the influence of important physiological characteristics on contaminant accumulation with two scenarios. First, we probe the influence of sexual dimorphism by comparing gender-specific accumulation of a standard polychlorinated biphenyl congener, PCB153, in male and female round gobies. We hypothesize that lipid loss in female gobies during spawning season leads to a decrease in the PCB body burden compared to male gobies. Second, we compare PCB accumulation in the round goby and in the mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi), the native forage fish that the round goby displaced in southern Lake Michigan, to determine whether the invasive species has an intrinsically different bioaccumulation potential than the native one. Our non-intuitive findings from these simulations illustrate how the interaction of growth rate with other life history characteristics lead to unexpected bioaccumulation patterns. The model we present is a flexible tool that integrates complex and dynamic interactions among environmental parameters, thus providing a means to better assess the potential for chemical accumulation in human and wildlife populations, and aiding the development of ecological forecasts.

However, if co-dominant species have traits that lead them to differential responses, then predicting how ecosystem structure and function will be altered is more challenging. We assessed differences in response to climate change factors for the two dominant C-4 grass species in tallgrass prairie, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, by measuring changes in a suite of plant ecophysiological traits in response to experimentally elevated air temperatures and increased precipitation variability over two growing seasons. Maximum photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, water-use efficiency, chlorophyll fluorescence, and leaf water potential varied with leaf and canopy temperature as well as with volumetric soil water content (0-15 cm). Both species had similar responses to imposed changes in temperature and water availability, but when differences occurred. responses by A. gerardii were more closely linked with changes in air temperature whereas S. nutans was more sensitive to changes in water availability. Moreover, S. nutans was more responsive overall than A. gerardii to climate alterations. These results indicate both grass species are responsive to forecast changes in temperature and precipitation, but their differential sensitivity to temperature and water availability Suggest that future population and community structure may vary based on the magnitude and scope of an altered climate.

The Iberian Peninsula. We modelled environmental favourability for the lynx based on its distribution before 1989, and for the rabbit using distribution data collected primarily after 1989, and validated them using independent abundance data. We compared both models and combined them in a lynx occurrence forecast. We correlated the prevalence of southwestern rabbit lineage with the environmental favourability for the rabbit. The environmental lynx model correlated with past lynx abundance data, but did not reflect its recent strong range contraction. The rabbit model correlated with recent rabbit abundance, but was negatively correlated with the environmental model for the lynx. The combination of both models forecasted lynx occurrence in a few separated nuclei, which encompass all recent lynx records. The prevalence of rabbit's southwestern lineage correlated negatively with favourability for the rabbit. The region to which the lynx became confined before 1989 is currently less favourable for rabbits, whereas more favourable areas remain outside lynx reach. This differential favourability correlates with rabbit phylogeographical structure, suggesting that the southwestern lineage is facing more unfavourable conditions or is less resilient to recent diseases. The loss of concordance between lynx distribution and the whole rabbit phylogeographical structure has prevented lynx persistence in northeastern rabbit lineage areas, which should be considered in lynx reintroduction planning. Similar conservation problems could affect other ecologically interacting species whose distributions' overlapping has sharply diminished.",,,,"Delibes, Miguel/K-2744-2014; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010; Rodriguez, Alejandro/E-7709-2011; Barbosa, A.

Lakes appear to be particularly sensitive to the ecological impacts of climate variability, and several long time series have shown a close coupling between climate, lake thermal properties and individual organism physiology, population abundance, community structure, and food web dynamics. Thus, understanding the complex interplay among meteorological forcing, hydrological variability, and ecosystem functioning is essential for improving the credibility of model-based water resources/fisheries management. Our objective herein is to examine the relative importance of the ecological mechanisms underlying plankton seasonal variability in Lake Washington, Washington State (USA), over a 35-year period (1964-1998). Our analysis is founded upon an intermediate complexity plankton model that is used to reproduce the limiting nutrient (phosphate)-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (particulate phosphorus) dynamics in the lake. Model parameterization is based on a Bayesian calibration scheme that offers insights into the degree of information the data contain about model inputs and allows obtaining predictions along with uncertainty bounds for modeled output variables. The model accurately reproduces the key seasonal planktonic patterns in Lake Washington and provides realistic estimates of predictive uncertainty for water quality variables of environmental management interest. A principal component analysis of the annual estimates of the underlying ecological processes highlighted the significant role of the phosphorus recycling stemming from the zooplankton excretion on the planktonic food web variability. We also identified a moderately significant signature of the local climatic conditions (air temperature) on phytoplankton growth (r= 0.41), herbivorous grazing (r= 0.38), and detritus mineralization (r= 0.39). Our study seeks linkages with the conceptual food web model proposed by Hampton et al. [Hampton, S.E., Scheuerell, M.D., Schindler, D.E., 2006b. Coalescence in the Lake Washington story: interaction strengths in a planktonic food web. Limnol. Oceanogr. 51, 2042-2051.] to emphasize the ""bottom-up"" control of the Lake Washington plankton phenology. The posterior predictive distributions of the plankton model are also used to assess the exceedance frequency and confidence of compliance with total phosphorus (15 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (4 mu g L-1) threshold levels during the summer-stratified period in Lake Washington. Finally, we conclude by underscoring the importance of explicitly acknowledging the uncertainty in ecological forecasts to the management of freshwater ecosystems under a changing global environment.

If these forecasts are realized, cropping systems are likely to experience significant geographic range transformations among damaging endemic weed species and new vulnerabilities to exotic weed invasions. To anticipate these changes and to devise management strategies for proactively addressing them, it is necessary to characterize the environmental conditions that make specific weed species abundant, competitive, and therefore damaging the production of particular crops (i.e. defining the damage niche). In this study, U.S. maize is used as a model system to explore the implications of climate change on the distribution of damaging agricultural weeds. To accomplish this, we couple ensemble climate change projections of annual temperature and precipitation with survey data of troublesome weed species in maize. At the state scale, space-for-time substitution techniques are used to suggest the potential magnitude of change among damaging weed communities. To explore how the geography of damage for specific species may evolve over the next century, bioclimatic range rules were derived for two weed species that are pervasive in the Northern (Abutilon theophrasti Medicus, ABUTH) and Southern (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., SORHA) U.S. Results from both analyses suggest that the composition of damaging weed communities may be fundamentally altered by climate change. In some states, potential changes in the coming decades are commensurate to those possible by the end of the century. Regions such as the Northeastern U.S. may prove particularly vulnerable with emerging climate conditions favoring few weed species of present-day significance. In contrast, regions like the mid-South are likely to experience fewer shifts even with a similar magnitude in climate change. By the end of the century in the U.S. Corn Belt, cold-tolerant species likeA. theophrasti may be of minor importance whereas S. halepense, a predominantly Southern U.S. weed species at present, may become common and damaging to maize production with its damage niche advancing 200-600 km north of its present-day distribution.

Here we demonstrate the use of survival regression, an approach that can be used to study a variety of events, not just death, to model the time to colonization. The advantage of survival regression to study colonisation of new areas is that information on those areas that have not been invaded by the end of a study can be included in the analysis, thus potentially increasing the accuracy of parameter estimation. We use proportional hazards regression (PHR; a type of survival regression) to model the spread of the common waxbill Estrilda astrild in Portugal. The species invaded Portugal in two peaks of invasion between 1964 and 1999. We built a PHR model with the information available up to the first invasion peak, then used this model to predict the pattern of invasion in the second peak. PHR had useful forecasting capabilities: areas that were actually colonised by 1999 had significantly higher hazards of colonization based on information from the first wave of invasion than areas that were not colonised. We then built a final model of expansion of the common waxbill that combined all available data up to 1999. Among climate variables, the most important predictor of colonization was temperature, followed by relative humidity. We used this model to estimate the invasion potential of the species under climate change scenarios, observing that an increase of 1 degrees C in mean annual temperature increased the risk of a new invasion by 47%. Our analyses suggest that survival regression may be a useful tool for studying the geographical spread of invasive species. However, PHR was conceived as a descriptive technique rather than as a predictive tool, and thus further research is needed to empirically test the predictive capabilities of PHR.",,,,"Reino, Luis/A-9261-2008; Moya-Larano, Jordi/K-8596-2014","Reino, Luis/0000-0002-9768-1097; Moya-Larano, Jordi/0000-0001-7141-3206","Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/14085/2003]; MinistErio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e do Ensino Superior; Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish Government","We are indebted to D.

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be con. dent in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples ( both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed.

A drawback to PVA is the high degree of uncertainty in these forecasts due to both population stochasticity and parameter estimation uncertainty. With sparse or noisy data, extinction probabilities frequently have 95% confidence intervals ranging from 0 to 1. To make stochastic simulation results more interpretable, we present a new metric, susceptibility to quasi-extinction (SQE), to assess whether or not a population is at risk of declining to a prespecified level (quasi-extinction). Following standard methods for diffusion approximation of extinction risk, we use a parametric bootstrap to determine the 95% CI for the probability of quasi-extinction. SQE is the proportion of this parametric bootstrap that indicates a high (defined as >= 0.90) probability of quasi-extinction, resulting in a point estimate that integrates both parameter uncertainty and stochasticity in extinction forecasting. We demonstrate the application of the metric with sea turtle nest census data, which have a high degree of year-to-year variance and represent only a small fraction of the total population. Using population simulations, we found that for these types of data a critical SQE value of 0.40 corresponds to populations that have a true risk of quasi-extinction. The metric has an accuracy of >80%, which can be increased further by lowering the 0.40 threshold and trading off Type I error (considering a population to be ""not at risk'' when it actually is) and Type II error (considering a population to be ""at risk'' when it actually is not), giving managers a flexible and quantitative tool for assessments of population status.",,,,,,Pacific and Atlantic Sea Turtle Assessment (PASTA); Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station [ORE00102],"We thank T.

Plant growth, population and community dynamics in dry environments are likely to be affected by these changes since productivity is already limited by water availability. We tested the effects of reduced precipitation and fewer rain events on three semiarid plant communities dominated by annual species. Three semiarid plant communities from Almeria province (SE Spain). Rain-out shelters were set up in each community and watering quantity and frequency were manipulated from autumn to early summer. Plant productivity, cover and diversity were measured at the end of the experimental period. We found that a 50% reduction in watering reduced productivity, plant cover and diversity in all three communities. However, neither the 25% reduction in watering nor changes in the frequency of watering events affected these parameters. The lack of response to small reductions in water could be due to the identity and resistance of the plant communities involved, which are adapted to rainfall variability characteristic of arid environments. Therefore, a rainfall reduction of 25% or less may not affect these plant communities in the short term, although higher reductions or long-term changes in water availability would probably reduce productivity and diversity in these communities.",,,,"Suau, Roberto Lazaro/S-1428-2019; Lazaro, Roberto/D-3479-2013; Miranda, Juande/C-4485-2011; Padilla, Francisco M./C-5204-2009; Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008","Suau, Roberto Lazaro/0000-0001-7940-9594; Lazaro, Roberto/0000-0001-7940-9594; Padilla, Francisco M./0000-0003-1021-0258; Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2004-00090/CLI, REN2003-04570/GLO, CGL2007-63718/BOS, CGL2007-63258]; FPU fellowshipSpanish Government [AP2002-1216]","We especially thank F.

Although small-scale experiments have documented the importance of maternal quality to offspring survival in plants and animals, the effects of this association on the recruitment dynamics of exploited populations are largely unknown. Here, we present results from both a simple population model and a meta-analysis of time-series data from 25 species of exploited marine fishes that suggest that a population of older, larger individuals has a higher maximum reproductive rate than an equivalent population of younger, smaller individuals, and that this difference increases with the reproductive lifespan of the population.

This is particularly true given the idiosyncratic nature of invasions, in which both historical and local conditions affect establishment success and hinder our ability to generate guidelines for early detection and eradication of invasive species. To overcome these limitations we have implemented a comprehensive approach that examines plant invasions at three spatial scales: regional, landscape, and local levels. At each scale, in combination with the others, we have evaluated the role of key environmental variables such as climate, landscape structure, habitat type, and canopy closure in the spread of three commonly found invasive woody plant species in New England, Berberis thunbergii, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Euonymus alatus. We developed a spatially explicit hierarchical Bayesian model that allowed us to take into account the ongoing nature of the spread of invasive species and to incorporate presence/absence data from the species' native ranges as well as from the invaded regions. Comparisons between predictions from climate-only models with those from the multiscale forecasts emphasize the importance of including landscape structure in our models of invasive species' potential distributions. In addition, predictions generated using only native range data performed substantially worse than those that incorporated data from the target range.

However, land-cover changes result from a variety of different processes, and it is not clear how effective species distribution models are in capturing species responses to these changes. In this study, we evaluated our ability to predict the effects of land-cover changes on shifts in species distributions at large spatial and temporal scales using Mediterranean landscapes and early-successional, open-habitat birds as study models. Based on presence-absence data from the second Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002), we applied six different species distribution modeling techniques for 10 bird species using climate, topographic, and land-cover data as predictor variables. Then we back-projected the models on land-cover conditions from 1980 to evaluate the projections with field observation data from the first Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1975-1983). Finally, we assessed if, in addition to changes in habitat suitability resulting from land-cover shifts, descriptors of. re impact contributed to further explain species distribution dynamics: colonization and local extinction. We developed accurate model projections of current and past global patterns of species distribution, but our ability to predict species distribution dynamics was reduced. Colonization dynamics were generally more strongly related to. re descriptors than to changes in overall habitat suitability derived from land-cover changes. Our results warn of the dangers of projecting species distribution models onto future conditions if processes behind species distribution dynamics are not explicitly included. Consideration of ecologically meaningful processes for species (i.e., fire disturbance) when modeling species' distribution might contribute to a better explanation of species' colonization dynamics.",,,,"Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; Brotons, Lluis/D-1570-2009; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Brotons, Lluis/0000-0002-4826-4457; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Vallecillo, Sara/0000-0002-5105-6253",Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2005-2000031/BOS]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [044399]; EcoChangeEuropean Union (EU) [066866]; Comissionat per a Universitats i Recerca of the Departament d'Innovacio; Universitats i Empresa from the Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF),"We thank all the volunteers who participated in the two Catalan Breeding Bird Atlases.

The biodiversity-rich Amazon forest is a region of growing concern because many global climate model (GCM) scenarios of climate change forecast reduced precipitation and, in some cases, coupled vegetation models predict dieback of the forest. To date, fires have generally been spatially co-located with road networks and associated human land use because almost all fires in this region are anthropogenic in origin. Climate change, if severe enough, could alter this situation, potentially changing the fire regime to one of increased fire frequency and severity for vast portions of the Amazon forest. High moisture contents and dense canopies have historically made Amazonian forests extremely resistant to fire spread. Climate will affect the fire situation in the Amazon directly, through changes in temperature and precipitation, and indirectly, through climate-forced changes in vegetation composition and structure. The frequency of drought will be a prime determinant of both how often forest fires occur and how extensive they become. Fire risk management needs to take into account landscape configuration, land cover types and forest disturbance history as well as climate and weather. Maintaining large blocks of unsettled forest is critical for managing landscape level fire in the Amazon. The Amazon has resisted previous climate changes and should adapt to future climates as well if landscapes can be managed to maintain natural fire regimes in the majority of forest remnants.",,,,"Cochrane, Mark A/A-1735-2018","Cochrane, Mark A/0000-0002-4573-568X",,,,,112,113,3,95,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The per capita population growth rate between years t and t+1 correlated strongly with the proportion of individuals living in the dangerous top 4 cm layer of the sediment in year t: the more individuals in the top layer, the steeper the population decline.

The most widely used prediction method is to model individual species niches from point observations and project these models forward using future climate scenarios. The resulting changes in individual ranges are then summed to predict diversity changes; multiple models can be combined to produce ensemble forecasts. Predictions based on environment-richness regressions are rarer. However, richness regression models, based on macroecological diversity theory, have a long track record of making reliable spatial predictions of diversity patterns. If these empirical theories capture true functional relationships between environment and diversity, then they should make consistent predictions through time as well as space and could complement individual species-based predictions. Here, we use climate change throughout the 20th century to directly test the ability of these different approaches to predict shifts of Canadian butterfly diversity. We found that all approaches performed reasonably well, but the most accurate predictions were made using the single best richness-environment regression model, after accounting for the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Spatially trained regression models based on macroecological theory accurately predict diversity shifts for large species assemblages. Global changes provide pseudo-experimental tests of those macroecological theories that can then generate robust predictions of future conditions.",,,,,"Algar, Adam/0000-0001-8095-0097","NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Ministry of Research and InnovationMinistry of Research and Innovation, Ontario","Rachelle Desrochers and David Currie provided useful comments and suggestions.

The invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum is a notorious invader with significant negative impacts on cultured shellfish and natural benthic communities, including commercially important ones. We conducted an expert survey, identifying the five most important transport vectors for D. vexillum along the west coast of North America. We determined the spatially explicit vector density for all vectors in order to identify introduction hotspots. Additionally, we developed an environmental niche model based on 46 occurrence points and nine environmental variables to identify areas suitable for D. vexillum. Spatial distribution of the most important transport vectors (slow-moving vessels, aquaculture, fishing vessels, small vessels, and large commercial vessels) identified several hotspots with high vector densities. These proved to be a very good predictor of current D. vexillum occurrence in British Columbia (BC). Ecological niche modelling (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction) predicted suitable environments in southern BC, parts of central BC and along the east coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Independent validation of the model based on the current distribution in BC indicated good predictive accuracy. Additional analytical steps confirmed that no environmental variable dominated the predictions and we identified ranges of environmental conditions predicted suitable by the model. We identified areas of high establishment probability for D. vexillum by combining the vector model and environmental niche model. Parts of central BC, the west coast of Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia are areas where D. vexillum is most likely to establish. Synthesis and applications. Spatially explicit predictions of the potential distribution of biological invaders are crucial for informing risk assessments, development of management strategies, and resource allocation. While most studies only focus on one step in the invasion process, we successfully combined the likelihood of introduction and establishment. Results from this study are informing the canadian risk assessment of invasive tunicates, guiding current monitoring efforts, and providing a basis for potential intervention/mediation measures.",,,,,,Centre of Expertise for Aquatic Risk Assessment (Department of Fisheries and Oceans),"We would like to thank the Centre of Expertise for Aquatic Risk Assessment (Department of Fisheries and Oceans) for funding L.M.H.

High-resolution airborne laser scanning is a recently developed remote-sensing method that provides data that can be used as surrogates for the vertical Structure of the vegetation. These data call be used for modelling the occurrence and abundance of species or species assemblages. Until now, few Studies evaluated the potential of these data for use in Such models, or compared the suitability of data obtained by airborne systems with data gained by alternative methods. To fill part of this gap, we used forest passerine bird species to evaluate airborne laser scanning data for statistical modelling of potential bird abundances and composition of assemblages. Birds were Counted in a mixed montane forest, on 223 1-ha plots along four transects. In the same period, these areas were scanned using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) to characterise canopy Structure. Additionally, we used Visual interpretations of aerial photographs and field Measurements oil the same plots to derive habitat variables for comparison. We found clear correlations between the LiDAR variables and the other two variable sets using canonical correlation analysis. With a few exceptions, predictive power of the LiDAR data set for modelling abundances of single species, with up to 40% explained variance, was superior to that of the other two data sets. Models agreed with existing ecological knowledge for these species. For modelling of species composition with redundancy analysis. LiDAR was also superior to the other two data sets with more than 20% unique contribution to the explained variance. Our results clearly showed that LiDAR provides valuable data for describing and modelling single species as well as assemblages of forest organisms. (c) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

The ensemble consists of ten members and the reference simulation using the operationnal short range forecast PEARP, perturbed using the Singular Vector technique. We then used this ensemble of simulations as the initial and boundary conditions for the meso scale model (M,so-NH) simulations, which uses CO2 fluxes from the ISBA-A-gs land surface model. The final ensemble represents the model dependence to the boundary conditions, conserving the physical properties of the dynamical schemes, but excluding the intrinsic error of the model. </br > First, the variance of our ensemble is estimated over the domain, with associated spatial and temporal correlations. Second, we extract the signal from noisy horizontal correlations, due to the limited size ensemble, using diffusion equation modelling. The computational cost of such ensemble limits the number of members (simulations) especially when running online the carbon flux and the atmospheric models. In the theory, 50 to 100 members would be required to explore the overall sensitivity of the ensemble. The present diffusion model allows us to extract a significant part of the noisy error, and makes this study feasable with a limited number of simulations. Finally, we compute the diagonal and non-diagonal terms of the observation error covariance matrix and introduced it into our CO2 flux matrix inversion for 18 days of the 2005 intensive campaign CERES over the South West of France. Variances are based on model-data mismatch to ensure we treat model bias as well as ensemble dispersion, whereas spatial and temporal covariances are estimated with our method. </br > The horizontal structure of the ensemble variance manifests the discontinuities of the mesoscale structures during the day, but remains locally driven during the night. On the vertical, surface layer variance shows large correlations with the upper levels in the boundary layer (> 0.6), dropping to 0.4 with the lower levels of the free troposphere. Large temporal correlations were found during the afternoon (> 0.5 for several hours), reduced during the night. The diffusion equation model extracted relevant error covariance signals horizontally, with reduced correlations over mountain areas and during the night over the continent. The posterior error reduction on the inverted CO2 fluxes accounting for the model error correlations illustrates the predominance of the temporal over the spatial correlations when using tower-based CO2 concentration observations.",,,,"Chevallier, Frederic JM/E-9608-2016; Chevallier, Frederic/AAF-6452-2019","Chevallier, Frederic JM/0000-0002-4327-3813; Chevallier, Frederic/0000-0002-4327-3813; Pannekoucke, Olivier/0000-0002-3249-2818; Lauvaux, Thomas/0000-0002-7697-742X; Rayner, Peter/0000-0001-7707-6298",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre,"Thanks to J.

The first major outbreak in Saskatchewan was recorded in 1983. Today wheat midge infests much of the wheat-growing area of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and North Dakota (USA), and is beginning to invade Alberta and Montana (USA). In 1984, Saskatchewan wheat midge populations were found to be parasitized by the egg-larval parasitoid, Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) (Hymenoptera). Through the successful implementation of conservation techniques, this parasitoid now controls an average of 31.5% of the wheat midge across Saskatchewan. Estimated value of the parasitoid, due to reduction in insecticide costs in Saskatchewan alone, was estimated to be in excess of $248.3 million in the 1990s. The environmental benefits of not having to apply this amount of chemical insecticide are a bonus. To minimize the economic and ecological impact of S. mosellana today, wheat producers in western Canada have access to one of the most comprehensive management programs of any insect pest of field crops. Forecasts and risk warnings, monitoring tools, cultural control, agronomic practices, chemical control, biological control and plant resistance are all available for producers to manage wheat midge.",,,,,,Saskatchewan Crop Insurance,Special thanks are extended to M.

We focus on models that include physics and are therefore spatially explicit, and review models under the categories of those that include lower trophic level dynamics (NPZ(1)), early life stages of fish (eggs and larvae), and juvenile and adult stages. We first give an overview of the methods that are used to represent transport, growth, mortality, and behavior in biophysical models of early life stages. Second, we detail several case studies of such models, focusing on those applied to anchovy and.. sardine in SPACC regions and those involving small pelagic fish in ""non-SPACC"" regions. Some questions related to climate change require models that include juveniles and adults. Models that include juveniles and adults differ from the early life stage models in the important role played by behavior in fish movement. We briefly discuss several approaches used for modeling behavioral movement of fish, and then summarize several case studies of biophysical models that include adults that are relevant, or potentially relevant, to small pelagic species.

In this review we summarize the assessment and management approaches applied in 29 SPF stocks or management units (12 anchovy, 10 sardine, 4 herring, and 3 sprat). The review demonstrates that the assessment and management of SPF varies substantially in its approach and performance between stocks and regions. Most stocks have a scientific assessment program in place and a management approach that generally takes into account assessment results, but in some stocks management practices deviate substantially from scientific advice and in some, assessment and management processes are largely disconnected. It is concluded that only properly tailored scientific assessment and management programs can provide the speed of response and the flexibility of management that highly variable SPF demand. The most effective monitoring programs are based on fishery-independent surveys (daily egg production or/and hydroacoustics), while analyses based on catch per unit effort offer limited value. Most assessments, defined as what management uses to base its decisions on, rely on catch-at-age or yield per recruit models. Harvest strategies range from those driven by harvest control rules to those derived from outputs of best assessment runs. Some stocks use operating models based on age-structure model outputs or forward VPA(1). On the issue of scientific uncertainty some practitioners propose reducing it through additional science and measures, while others promote the development of management procedures robust to uncertainty. This difference is particularly evident in relation to the value of recruitment forecasts. Other identified uncertainties include fishing versus natural mortality estimates and fleet catchability estimates. Regarding governance it is suggested that adaptive management practices applied by independent governance structures capable of interacting at ecological, social and economic levels need development for effective stewardship and governance. The review also addresses recent concerns over managing stocks that may be subject to productivity regimes or regime shifts, and whether two-level management strategies are required to address short- and long-term resource variability. The straddling nature of some stocks adds complexity to management procedures, and it is feared that this could be accentuated by climate-driven changes in stock distribution. Finally, SPF should be managed under ecosystem considerations, to protect their value as forage species to other fish, mammals and birds, and thus to respect the integrity of ecosystems. While the Ecosystem Approach is yet to be successfully applied to the management of any SPF, this may be the single most important driving force in influencing future assessment and management policies.",,,,"Dickey-Collas, Mark/A-8036-2008; Palomera, Isabel/L-4769-2014; Cubillos, Luis/S-5455-2019; CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014","Palomera, Isabel/0000-0001-5708-168X; Cubillos, Luis/0000-0003-0641-3722; CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; Stratoudakis, Yorgos/0000-0002-7801-4336",,,,,50,51,0,21,,,,,,978-0-521-88482-2,,,,2009,,,,,,,191,255,,,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Fisheries,,,WOS:000313446500011,,,,,

Consequently, the descending of b-value did not present the failure of rock, only AE frequency and magnitude factors could not reflect the structure status inside rock accurately, of course it could not forecast the rock dynamic disaster reliably. The mechanism of the rock dynamic failures is greatly complicated. For forecasting the rock failure more accurately, the information included in the AE signals need to be more excavated, and should conduct comprehensive analysis and investigation combined with the factors of mechanical status.",,,,,,,,,,2,2,0,1,,,,,,978-1-58949-058-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,1447,1450,,,,,,"Ecology; Engineering, Geological; Mining & Mineral Processing",,,WOS:000271028900209,,,,,

Corrosion allowances, based upon very simplistic considerations of general corrosion in untreated raw water, were a part of the original design. However, long term service in many such systems has shown that localized corrosion phenomena, from microbiologically influenced corrosion, pitting, and underdeposit effects, have compromised system integrity. Because of the complexity and random nature of corrosion processes, it is nearly impossible to develop a mathematically deterministic model (like the typically used corrosion allowances) that accurately predicts pipe wall loss. However, when statistical distributions are used to describe the various corrosion processes, mathematical algorithms that incorporate all of the distributions, iterated a statistically significant number of times, can be used to forecast the most probable number of leaks. This approach was used to predict the condition of service water piping at a US Nuclear Power Plant, comparing results to service experience and inspection results.

As electricity cannot be preserved because of the highest cost of storage, electricity production must following market demand, necessarily. Short-long term wind forecasting over different time steps is becoming an important process for the management of wind farms. Time series modelling of wind speeds is based on the valid assumption that all the causative factors are implicitly accounted for in the sequence of occurrence of the process itself. Hence, time series modelling is equivalent to physical modelling. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which perform a non-linear mapping between inputs and outputs, provide a robust approach for wind prediction.

ENMs attempt to capture associations between a species and its environment and are often used to draw biological inferences, to predict potential occurrences in unoccupied regions and to forecast future distributions under environmental change. The accuracy of ENMs, however, hinges critically on the quality of occurrence data. ENMs often use haphazardly collected data rather than data collected across the full spectrum of existing environmental conditions. Moreover, it remains unclear how processes affecting ENM predictions operate at different spatial scales. The scale (i.e. grain size) of analysis may be dictated more by the sampling regime than by biologically meaningful processes. The aim of our study is to jointly quantify how issues relating to region and scale affect ENM predictions using an economically important and ecologically damaging invasive species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). California, USA. We analysed the relationship between sampling sufficiency, regional differences in environmental parameter space and cell size of analysis and resampling environmental layers using two independently collected sets of presence/absence data. Differences in variable importance were determined using model averaging and logistic regression. Model accuracy was measured with area under the curve (AUC) and Cohen's kappa. We first demonstrate that insufficient sampling of environmental parameter space can cause large errors in predicted distributions and biological interpretation. Models performed best when they were parametrized with data that sufficiently sampled environmental parameter space. Second, we show that altering the spatial grain of analysis changes the relative importance of different environmental variables. These changes apparently result from how environmental constraints and the sampling distributions of environmental variables change with spatial grain. These findings have clear relevance for biological inference. Taken together, our results illustrate potentially general limitations for ENMs, especially when such models are used to predict species occurrences in novel environments. We offer basic methodological and conceptual guidelines for appropriate sampling and scale matching.",,,,,"Jetz, Walter/0000-0002-1971-7277",NOAA-GRFNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; USDA-NRIUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2006-35302-17255]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-0648733],"This research was supported through a NOAA-GRF to S.

Physical evidence of warming around the British Isles is presented and, whilst there has been considerable fluctuation, sea surface temperatures are at the highest levels recorded, surpassing previous warm periods (i.e. late 1950s). Examples are given of species that have been advancing or retreating polewards over the last 50 to 100 yr. On rocky shores, the extent of poleward movement is idiosyncratic and dependent upon life history characteristics, dispersal capabilities and habitat requirements. More Southern, warm water species have been recorded advancing than northern, cold water species retreating. Models have been developed to predict likely assemblage composition based on future environmental scenarios. We present qualitative and quantitative forecasts to explore the functional consequences of changes in the identity, abundance and species richness of gastropod grazers and foundation species such as barnacles and canopy-forming algae.

The numerical model includes an explicit representation of the benthic-pelagic coupling, which is stimulated by the increasing density of an invasive megabenthic filter feeder, the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata. The selected spatial resolution allows resolution of the heterogeneous density distribution of these organisms in the bay. Results show that the benthic nutrient dynamics are highly variable and strongly depend on the local conditions. This heterogeneity is not reflected in the pelagic phytoplankton Population dynamics because transport and mixing homogenize the distribution of nutrients and biomass. A seasonally resolved silica budget over the entire bay and estuaries emphasizes the important contribution of the benthic recycling fluxes to the supply of dissolved silica (dSi) during the productive period (similar to 50%, from 1 April to 1 September).

Although these blooms are recurring and recognized hazards, the factors driving bloom proliferation remain poorly understood. The lack of long-term field studies and/or deficiencies in the scope of environmental data included within them hinders the development of robust forecasting tools. For this study, we successfully developed predictive logistic models of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in Monterey Bay, California, from a multi-project dataset representing 8.3 yr of sampling effort. Models were developed for year-round (annual model) or seasonal use (spring and fall-winter models). The consideration of seasonality was significant: chlorophyll a (chl a) and silicic acid were predictors in all models, but period-specific inclusions of temperature, upwelling index, river discharge, and/or nitrate provided significant model refinement. Predictive power for 'unknown' (future) bloom cases was demonstrated at >= 75% for all models, out-performing a chl a anomaly model, and performing comparably to, or better than, previously described statistical models for Pseudo-nitzschia blooms or toxicity. The models presented here are the first to have been developed from long-term (>1.5 yr) monitoring efforts, and the first to have been developed for bloom prediction of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia species. The descriptive capacity of our models places historical and recent observations into greater ecological context, which could help to resolve historical alternation between the implication of freshwater discharge and upwelling processes in bloom dynamics.",,,,,,"NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA04NOS4780239, NA160C2936]","We thank P.

To understand how abundance was influenced by sea surface conditions, we examined the variations in the proportion of thermal habitats with favourable sea surface temperature (SST). The SST data of both the spawning and feeding grounds were used to calculate the monthly proportion of favourable-SST areas (PFSSTA). Catch per fishing day per fishing boat (catch per unit effort, CPUE) of the Chinese mainland squid-jigging fleet was used as squid abundance index. The relationships between CPUE and monthly PFSSTA at spawning and feeding grounds were analyzed, and the relationship between CPUE and selected PFSSTA was quantified with a multiple linear regression model. Results showed that February PFSSTA at the spawning ground and August to November PFSSTA at the feeding ground could account for about 60% of the variability in O. bartramii abundance between 1995 and 2004, that February was the most important period influencing squid recruitment during the spawning season, and that feeding ground PFSSTA during the fishing season would influence CPUE by causing squid to aggregate.

With few exceptions, such as chlorophyll concentrations, information on biological properties is harder to measure autonomously. Here, we present a system to produce estimates of the distribution and abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine. Our system uses satellite-based measurements of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration to determine the developmental and reproductive rates of C. finmarchicus. The rate information then drives a population dynamics model of C. finmarchicus that is embedded in a 2-dimensional circulation field. The first generation of this system produces realistic information on interannual variability in C. finmarchicus distribution and abundance during the winter and spring. The model can also be used to identify key drivers of interannual variability in C. finmarchicus. Experiments with the model suggest that changes in initial conditions are overwhelmed by variability in growth rates after approximately 50 d. Temperature has the largest effect on growth rate. Elevated chlorophyll during the late winter can lead to increased C. finmarchicus abundance during the spring, but the effect of variations in chlorophyll concentrations is secondary to the other inputs. Our system could be used to provide real-time estimates or even forecasts of C. finmarchicus distribution.

A link between the functional-form model (FFM) and the power-scaling approach (PSA) for a wide variety of marine macroalgae has been attempted for the first time in the present work. To test both approaches, thalli of 44 species of marine benthic macroalgae were collected from intertidal zones adjacent to Cadiz Bay. Metabolic rates, tissue nutrient content, surface area to biomass ratio (SA/B) and specific growth rates were measured for these species. PSA slopes were close to 2/3 power for growth rate, while metabolic rates scaled very close to, or matched, 3/4 power. The FFM descriptive model provided similar results to the PSA when it was transformed to a numerical model through the SA/B ratio. Even though both models appear to be valid, the problems derived from species allocation into morphological groups, and other previous criticisms, make the direct use of SA/B ratios more suitable for representing primary production in macroalgal functional groups in numerical models of coastal ecosystems.",,,,"de los Santos, Carmen B/L-3723-2014; Perez-Llorens, Jose Lucas/AAD-7078-2020; Vergara, Juan J/H-9808-2012; Perez-Llorens, Jose Lucas/B-9361-2009","de los Santos, Carmen B/0000-0002-7013-494X; Perez-Llorens, Jose Lucas/0000-0003-2813-1443; Vergara, Juan J/0000-0003-4479-4693; Perez-Llorens, Jose Lucas/0000-0003-2813-1443",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (MEC)Spanish Government [CTM2005-00395/MAR],"This study was supported by the project CTM2005-00395/MAR from the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (MEC), now Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN).

Prior to the onset of a shell disease epizootic in 1997, larval settlement alone fully explained 82% of the variation in the numbers of pre-recruit lobsters about to enter the Rhode Island lobster fishery. With the onset of shell disease, however, the model required an additional term for disease prevalence to provide a sufficient statistical fit to the observed data. Neither time trends in bottom temperature nor predatory fish provided significant additional explanatory power for variability in pre-recruit abundance. To our knowledge, this analysis constitutes the first demonstration in which cohorts of a benthic marine invertebrate have been successfully tracked from settlement to the threshold of a fishery by accounting for the joint effects of variable supply of new recruits and subsequent disease during post-settlement years. As such, it illustrates how factors altering the rate of post-settlement mortality over time can obscure predictive relationships between settlement and subsequent recruitment. A tight spawner-to-recruit linkage is therefore unlikely in coastal Rhode Island. The analysis underscores the value of maintaining parallel time series of different life stages, as well as the need to better quantify both pre- and post-settlement mechanisms that influence cohort success in marine populations.",,,,"Wahle, Richard/AAI-3047-2020",,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); NOAA Sea GrantNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Research support for the development of the lobster settlement index was provided by grants to R.A.W. from the US National Science Foundation and NOAA Sea Grant.

We examined a decadal pattern of population dynamics and its underlying mechanisms in a population of the encrusting sponge Crambe crambe. A photographic series monitored yearly for 14 yr (1993 to 2007) was analyzed. A total of 133 genets and 157 ramets were individually identified and followed over 14 yr to record their fates: survivorship, partial mortality, recruitment via larvae, asexual events (fission and fusion), and growth, The number of genets varied little over time; their survival was high and differed significantly with size class (52, 82, and 100% for size classes 0-250, 250-700, and >700 mm(2), respectively), while recruitment via larvae was very low. Overall, the population was characterized by the inputs and outputs of asexual ramets. Patterns of partial mortality were (1) significantly related to size and (2) did not differ significantly among years, and (3) no patch >500 mm(2) suffered any type of mortality. We give the first evidence that net growth over more than a decade was close to zero for the larger specimens, while the smallest specimens exhibited the highest growth rates, quadrupling in size over 14 yr. Low mortality combined with the slow growth of large specimens indicates that C, crambe may live for several decades.

The sea star Pisaster ochraceus is a keystone predator in the rocky intertidal zone with a broad geographic distribution along the west coast of North America. We developed a mechanistic heat budget model that uses environmental data to predict the body temperatures of P. ochraceus. Model accuracy was verified by comparing model output temperatures, generated using measured microclimatic data as input, to the temperatures of live P. ochraceus in the field. The average absolute errors between predicted and measured body temperatures were similar to 1 degrees C. To continuously monitor sea star body temperatures in the field, we developed data loggers that thermally mimic P. ochraceus. Accuracy of these biomimetic loggers was tested by comparing logger temperatures to P. ochraceus body temperatures, and they were found to mimic body temperatures within similar to 1 degrees C. Loggers were deployed at different tidal heights at a site in Bamfield, British Columbia, Canada, to investigate within-site body temperature variation. We also explored the relationship between body temperature and vertical distribution of P, ochraceus. A negative correlation was found between maximum body temperatures on Day n and the number of sea stars found in the intertidal on Day n + 1. These results suggest that temperatures reached during aerial exposure at low tide, at least in part, may determine where in the intertidal zone these sea stars are located, which could affect their foraging limits.",,,,"Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014; Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414",NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNG04GE43G]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA04NOS4780264]; Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre Graduate Research Scholarship,"We thank Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for providing logistical support and access to the sites used in this study.

Changes in rainfall patterns may have large effects on a wide range of biological processes such as seed germination, seedling establishment, plant growth, community composition, and population and community dynamics. Climate change models for the Mediterranean region forecast reduced annual precipitation and more extreme rain events (i.e., fewer rainy days and longer drought periods between rainfall events), along with seasonal changes. We experimentally addressed the response of a semiarid Mediterranean community to higher aridity and changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in two glasshouse experiments in which we manipulated water supply. We simulated a delay in the onset of autumn rainfalls (i.e., a longer summer drought period), decreased watering amount and frequency as predicted by climate models, and manipulated the seasonality of water supply. We found that delayed watering led to decreases in plant community productivity and to delays in flowering time, in terms of both date and number of days of water supply. Decreased watering amount and frequency, and accentuated seasonality, also diminished biomass and individuals recruited, but did not change flower phenology. Species diversity was not affected by watering delays; however, it was reduced by changes in frequency, amount and seasonality. Overall, these data underline the need to consider rainfall patterns as an important element that might alter community dynamics and ecosystem structure and functioning. Therefore, the analysis of climate change consequences must not depend on climatic means-based scenarios but must take into account expected seasonal changes in rainfall quantity and frequency.

The 'safe' livestock carrying capacity (LCC) required to maintain resource condition is strongly dependent on climate. We reviewed: the approaches for quantifying LCC; current trends in climate and their effect on components of the grazing system; implications of the 'best estimates' of climate change projections for LCC; the agreement and disagreement between the current trends and projections; and the adequacy of current models of forage production in simulating the impact of climate change. We report the results of a sensitivity study of climate change impacts on forage production across the rangelands, and we discuss the more general issues facing grazing enterprises associated with climate change, such as 'known uncertainties' and adaptation responses (e.g. use of climate risk assessment). We found that the method of quantifying LCC from a combination of estimates (simulations) of long-term (>30 years) forage production and successful grazier experience has been well tested across northern Australian rangelands with different climatic regions. This methodology provides a sound base for the assessment of climate change impacts, even though there are many identified gaps in knowledge. The evaluation of current trends indicated substantial differences in the trends of annual rainfall (and simulated forage production) across Australian rangelands with general increases in most of western Australian rangelands ( including northern regions of the Northern Territory) and decreases in eastern Australian rangelands and south-western Western Australia. Some of the projected changes in rainfall and temperature appear small compared with year-to-year variability. Nevertheless, the impacts on rangeland production systems are expected to be important in terms of required managerial and enterprise adaptations. Some important aspects of climate systems science remain unresolved, and we suggest that a risk-averse approach to rangeland management, based on the 'best estimate' projections, in combination with appropriate responses to short-term (1-5 years) climate variability, would reduce the risk of resource degradation. Climate change projections - including changes in rainfall, temperature, carbon dioxide and other climatic variables - if realised, are likely to affect forage and animal production, and ecosystem functioning. The major known uncertainties in quantifying climate change impacts are: (i) carbon dioxide effects on forage production, quality, nutrient cycling and competition between life forms (e.g. grass, shrubs and trees); and (ii) the future role of woody plants including effects of. re, climatic extremes and management for carbon storage. In a simple example of simulating climate change impacts on forage production, we found that increased temperature (3 degrees C) was likely to result in a decrease in forage production for most rangeland locations (e. g. -21% calculated as an unweighted average across 90 locations). The increase in temperature exacerbated or reduced the effects of a 10% decrease/increase in rainfall respectively (-33% or -9%). Estimates of the beneficial effects of increased CO2 (from 350 to 650 ppm) on forage production and water use efficiency indicated enhanced forage production (+26%). The increase was approximately equivalent to the decline in forage production associated with a 3 degrees C temperature increase. The large magnitude of these opposing effects emphasised the importance of the uncertainties in quantifying the impacts of these components of climate change. We anticipate decreases in LCC given that the 'best estimate' of climate change across the rangelands is for a decline (or little change) in rainfall and an increase in temperature. As a consequence, we suggest that public policy have regard for: the implications for livestock enterprises, regional communities, potential resource damage, animal welfare and human distress. However, the capability to quantify these warnings is yet to be developed and this important task remains as a challenge for rangeland and climate systems science.",,,,"Howden, Stuart M/C-1138-2008; Crimp, Steven/D-6995-2011; Syktus, Jozef/E-7173-2011; Stokes, Chris/G-5199-2010","Howden, Stuart M/0000-0002-0386-9671; Crimp, Steven/0000-0003-4068-573X; Syktus, Jozef/0000-0003-1782-3073; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457",,,,,110,117,1,58,,,,1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2009,31,1,,,,,1,29,,10.1071/RJ08068,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000264639900002,,,,,

In particular, the timing of the 'green break of the season' (GBOS) at the end of the dry season, when new pasture growth becomes available as forage and a live-weight gain is measured in cattle, affects several important management decisions that prevent overgrazing and pasture degradation. Currently, beef producers in the region use a GBOS rule based on rainfall (e. g. 40mm of rain over three days by 1 December) to de. ne the event and make their management decisions. A survey of 16 beef producers in north-east Queensland shows three quarters of respondents use a rainfall amount that occurs in only half or less than half of all years at their location. In addition, only half the producers expect the GBOS to occur within two weeks of the median date calculated by the CSIRO plant growth days model GRIM. This result suggests that in the producer rules, either the rainfall quantity or the period of time over which the rain is expected, is unrealistic. Despite only 37% of beef producers indicating that they use a southern oscillation index (SOI) forecast in their decisions, cross validated LEPS ( linear error in probability space) analyses showed both the average 3 month July-September SOI and the 2 month August-September SOI have significant forecast skill in predicting the probability of both the amount of wet season rainfall and the timing of the GBOS. The communication and implementation of a rigorous and realistic definition of the GBOS, and the likely impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the region are discussed in the context of the sustainable management of northern Australian rangelands.",,,,,,,,,,3,3,0,7,,,,1036-9872,,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2009,31,1,,,,,151,159,,10.1071/RJ08054,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000264639900013,,,,,

This does not however mean that it is in a comfortable position in terms of water availability and the location of consumptive and non-consumptive demand. In fact, around 90% of the water is to be found in the low demographic density hydrographic basins of the Amazonas and Tocantins rivers Around 90% of the Population relies on the remaining water resources. Given the major role of hydroelectric plants in the Brazilian Electricity System. power generation in the country is highly dependent on the hydrologic regimes of the hydrographic basins. Given that there is regional imbalance in water availability - as evidenced by recurrent droughts in the North-eastern region and by the degradation of rivers and soil in the South East, the socio-environmental risks to each re,,ion and the rapid increase in the demand for water and energy throughout country - new and existing hydroelectric energy plants are vulnerable, to a lesser or greater extent, to climate change. The risk of future global climate change i.e. further warming of the plalet, may alter the hydrologic cycle, and, consequently, the regime and hydric availability of the hydrologic cycle. In fact, differentiated changes in temperature lead to alterations in the range of atmospheric pressure and wind patterns. Changes in rainfall pattern are therefore to be expected. The forecast rise in sea levels by 2099 indicates, in various scenarios of greenhouse gas emission, a range of between 18 cm and 59 cm. The occurrence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been more frequent, longer and more intense during the last twenty-three years, in relation to the previous 100 years. There is, therefore, an urgent need for Study focused on the forecast and analysis of the climatic vulnerability of electric energy generation in Brazil, particularly in terms of the expected inflow into hydroelectric reservoirs based on climate and hydrological forecasts.

These problems can be exaggerated at the regional scale due to model resolution - adding further to the uncertainty as spatial scales decrease. For example, El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a direct impact on Florida's temperature, precipitation, and tropical cyclone numbers but is not well reproduced. The need for higher model resolution has led to the development of Regional Climate Models (RCMs). These models continue to undergo evaluation.

Flood forecasting, warning and emergency response play important roles ill reducing flood risk during the event. Options for flood risk management range from structural measures, such as raising dikes or channel enlargement, to non-structural measures to reduce exposure and vulnerability. The April 2000 floods in the western part of Romania (Crisuri River Basin) represented the starting point in creating a dedicated system for flood management using Earth Observation (EO) data. Starting from April 2005 this satellite-based surveillance system, connected to a dedicated GIS database, was extended to cover the whole Romanian territory. In order to obtain high-level thematic products, the data extracted from EO images were integrated with other spatial ancillary data (topographical, pedological, meteorological) and hydrological/hydraulic model outputs. A series of specific image processing operations were performed, using the ERDAS Imagine software: geometric correction and geo-referencing, image improvement, statistic analyses, etc. The optical and microwave satellite data supplied by the new European and American orbital platforms like the EOS-AM ""Terra"" and EOS-PM ""Aqua"", DMSP, Quikscat, SPOT, ERS, RADARSAT, Landsat7 have been used to identify and highlight flooded areas. This approach is used in different phases of establishing the sensitive areas such as: the database management; the calculation of risk indices from morpho-hydrographical, meteorological and hydrological data; interfacing with the models in order to improve their compatibility with input data; recovery of results and the possibility of working out scenarios; presentation of results as synthesis maps easy to access and interpret, adequate to also be combined with other information layouts resulted from the GIS database. The products which are useful for flood risk analysis include: accurately updated maps of land cover/land-use, comprehensive thematic maps at various spatial scales with the extent of the flooded areas and the affected zones, maps of hazard-prone areas.

Today, one of the possible methods is the assessment of risks and the possible ecological and economic damage resulting from catastrophes. We pay attention the most ecologically precarious regions and single out the typical factors that significantly increase the risk of natural and man-induced catastrophes. The prediction, prevention and assessment of the above mentioned threats are especially real and important for newly independent states, where the system of safety, frontier and customs control, strict visa control and other state safety measures have not yet been developed. Also, it is easier to implement attacks of terrorists in these regions. The consequences of such catastrophes will be followed by major human and huge material losses, and extremely negative irreversible environmental effects possibly of a global scale.

Decision theory should offer managers guidance to formulate the optimal allocation of resources. Unfortunately, current decision theory models typically do not consider invasion dynamics and do not make full use of the best models of biological spread and best biological data from theoretical models. We developed a decision theory model that integrated population dynamics, spread, uncertainty, and changes in management policies. We applied this model to leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), a high-priority invasive weed in North America. We used field data to construct a biological model that included stochastic population dynamics and spatial spread and integrated it with decision theory using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). The SDP model considered three control strategies: no control, biological control, and herbicide control. Solutions from the SDP model determined the optimal strategy to apply at a given state for any time horizon. The optimal strategy depended on the area and density of leafy spurge and varied with the time horizon; therefore, dynamic control is important in management programs. Biological control was consistently indicated as the optimal strategy for all time horizons. Herbicide control was the optimal strategy for small areas with high-density infestation for long time horizons. We conclude that dynamic control, forecasting, and the time horizon are important considerations for invasive species managers who are under financial, logistical, and time constraints.",,,,"Hyder, Ayaz/A-3738-2016","Hyder, Ayaz/0000-0003-4865-6482",,,,,18,18,0,21,,,,1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Non-native, invasive species can affect biological patterns and processes at multiple ecological scales. The multi-scalar effects of invasions can influence community structure, ecosystem processes and function, and the nature and intensity of ecological interactions. Consequently, efforts to assess the spread of invasive species may benefit from a multi-scale analytic approach. 2. We analysed results from landscape- and population-scale models for Syzygium jambos, a non-native tree in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico, to demonstrate a multi-scale approach that can be used to inform management decisions about invasive plants. At the landscape-level, we used an Ecological Niche Modelling approach to predict environmentally suitable habitats for the target plant. At the population-level, we constructed matrix projection models to determine the finite rate of population increase (lambda) for S. jambos. We then extrapolated lambda values to the landscape-scale to obtain a distribution map of lambda values for the Luquillo forest. 3. The landscape analyses suggested that the most environmentally suitable habitats were those most similar to where S. jambos had already been observed. The population-level analyses showed that four of the seven populations had lambda values less than 1, indicating that they were projected to be below replacement. The lambda distribution map showed that S. jambos growth was highest in areas where it was most common and lowest in areas where it was most rare. 4. Our analyses further suggested that the importance of different drivers of invasion and the environmental variables that mediate them appear to be strongly scale-dependent. Past disturbances seemed most important for controlling invasions at fine-spatial scales; while abiotic environmental variables modulated coarse-scale invasion dynamics. 5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that a multi-scale analytic approach can be used to manage invasive species by simultaneously targeting susceptible life stages and rapidly growing populations in a landscape. The utility of this approach stems from an ability to: (i) map the distribution of habitats that can potentially sustain lambda values above replacement; (ii) identify populations to manage or monitor during selected stages of an invasion; (iii) forecast the probability for a target species to increase above a critical threshold abundance; and (iv) set priorities for control and monitoring actions.",,,,"Brown, Kerry/U-5082-2019","Brown, Kerry/0000-0002-6342-8966","IITFUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); US Department of Agriculture, Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [012005]; Columbia Frontiers of Science Fellowship","We thank F.

The onset and extent of such disturbances, however, are difficult to forecast and study in the field. We address this problem by deploying a device that artificially induces and documents small-scale anoxia on soft bottom in 24 m depth. Behaviour changes and mortality sequences of the soft-bottom macroepi- and infauna over a 5.5-day deployment were documented. An intervening oxygen peak created two phases of declining oxygen values. All initiated behaviours were interrupted during the reoxygenation and predictably re-appeared in the second phase, demonstrating the direct relationship between oxygen levels and behaviour. Beginning hypoxia (<= 2.0 ml l(-1) DO) elicited escape patterns such as increased horizontal and vertical locomotion. Moderate hypoxia (<= 1.0 ml l(-1) DO) triggered species-specific sublethal effects such as arm-tipping in ophiuroids or extension from the sediment in sea anemones. At severe hypoxia (<= 1.0 ml l(-1) DO) infaunal organisms began to emerge and first mortalities occurred. The crustacean Macropodio sp., the sea urchin Psammechinus microtuberculatus and the brittle star Ophiothrix quinquemaculata were among the first to die; the sea anemone Cereus pedunculatus and the gastropod Hexaplex trunculus survived. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) increased until the end of the deployment to 163 mu M; temperature in the chamber remained nearly constant at 18.5 degrees C. This design provides insight into species and community-level processes and is an important step in identifying potential indicator species for low DO events in the Northern Adriatic and elsewhere.

The FORecasting SCEnarios of future land-cover (FORE-SCE) model used Land Cover Trends data and theoretical, statistical, and deterministic modeling techniques to project future land-cover change through 2050 for the southeastern United States. Prescriptions for future proportions of land cover for this application were provided by ecoregion-based extrapolations of historical change. Logistic regression was used to develop relationships between suspected drivers of land-cover change and land cover, resulting in the development of probability-of-occurrence surfaces for each unique land-cover type. Forest stand age was initially established with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data and tracked through model iterations. The spatial allocation procedure placed patches of new land cover on the landscape until the scenario prescriptions were met, using measured Land Cover Trends data to guide patch characteristics and the probability surfaces to guide placement. The approach provides an efficient method for extrapolating historical land-cover trends and is amenable to the incorporation of more detailed and focused studies for the establishment of scenario prescriptions.

A lack of case studies limits our ability to generalize about the factors that have regulated populations in the past and will be important in the future. Here, we take a first step toward identifying the drivers of plant population dynamics by studying the influence of climate and species interactions on the recruitment and survival of ten forb species from a Kansas ( USA) prairie. Combining a long-term demographic data set with a Bayesian hierarchical-modeling approach, we fit models in which annual survival and recruitment rates are driven by precipitation, temperature, and species composition. Although the effects of these covariates differed among species, three general patterns emerged. First, climate had a greater influence than species composition on historical population dynamics. Second, forecasted increases in mean temperatures are likely to impact the population growth of these species more than future changes in precipitation or composition. Third, the significant effects of both climate and species composition on recruitment suggest that range expansions will be particularly difficult to forecast. Based on these patterns, we recommend field experiments to evaluate the ability of plant species to recruit at expanding range margins under warmer temperatures.",,,,"Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0614068]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,"We thank Jonathan Levine and Mevin Hooten for helping us develop ideas and methods, and Harmony Dalgleish, Ines Ibanez, David Koons, and three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on previous versions of the manuscript.

Many approaches to predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity so far have been based purely on a climate envelope approach and have not considered direct and indirect species interactions. Using a long-term observational data set (>30 years) of competing intertidal barnacle species, we built a hierarchy of age-structured two-taxa population models (Semibalanus balanoides vs. Chthamalus montagui and C. stellatus combined as one taxon) to test if the presence of a dominant competitor can mediate climatic influence on the subordinate species. Models were parameterized using data from populations on the south coast of southwest England and verified by hindcasting using independent north coast population data. Recruitment of the dominant competitor, S. balanoides, is driven by temperature. The mechanisms of competition explored included simple space preemption and temperature-driven interference competition. The results indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile barnacles is important in regulating chthamalid density but not that of the dominant competitor S. balanoides. Simulations were carried out using alternative future climate scenarios to predict barnacle population abundance over the next century. Under all emission scenarios, the cold-water S. balanoides is predicted to virtually disappear from southwest England by the 2050s, leading to the competitive release of Chthamalus throughout the entire region and thereby substantially increasing its abundance and occupied habitat (by increasing vertical range on the shore). Our results demonstrate that climate change can profoundly affect the abundance and distribution of species through both the direct effects of temperature on survival, and also by altering important negative interactions through shifting competitive balances and essentially removing dominant competitors or predators. Climate change impacts on organisms are unlikely to lead only to straightforward, easily predictable changes in population size and distribution. The complex, indirect effects of climate change need to be taken into account if we are to accurately forecast the long-term effects of global warming.",,,,"Poloczanska, Elvira/F-4366-2014; Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008; poloczanska, elvira/P-5356-2014; Burrows, Michael/D-9844-2013","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; poloczanska, elvira/0000-0001-8470-0925",,,,,163,164,3,127,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2008,89,11,,,,,3138,3149,,10.1890/07-1169.1,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000261053500018,31766801,,,,

Species-discharge relationships (SDR) are aquatic analogues of species-area relationships, and are increasingly used in both basic research and conservation planning. SDR studies are often limited, however, by two shortcomings. First, they do not determine whether reported SDRs, which normally use complete drainage basins as sampling units, are scale dependent. Second, they do not account for the effects of habitat diversity within or among samples. 2. We addressed both problems by using discrete fish zones as sampling units in a SDR analysis. To do so, we first tested for longitudinal zonation in three rivers in the southeastern U.S.A. In each river, we detected successive 'lower', 'middle', and 'upper' fish zones, which were characterized by distinct fish assemblages with predictable habitat requirements. Because our analyses combined fish data from multiple sources, we also used rarefaction and Monte Carlo simulation to ensure that our zonation results were robust to spurious sampling effects. 3. Next, we estimated the average discharge within each zone, and plotted these estimates against the respective species richness within each zone (log(10) data). This revealed a significant, linear SDR (r(2) = 0.83; P < 0.01). Notably, this zonal SDR fit the empirical data better than a comparable SDR that did not discriminate among longitudinal zones. We therefore conclude that the southeastern fish SDR is scale dependent, and that accounting for within-basin habitat diversity is an important step in explaining the high diversity of southeastern fishes. 4. We then discuss how our zonal SDR can be used to improve conservation planning. Specifically, we show how the slope of the SDR can be used to forecast potential extinction rates, and how the zonal data can be used to identify species of greatest concern.",,,,"McGarvey, Daniel John/A-7725-2009","McGarvey, Daniel John/0000-0002-1218-5896",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE9972810]; U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; University of Alabama (Department of Biological Sciences),"Many thanks to Pat O'Neil and Scott Mettee (Geological Survey of Alabama) for generously supplying fish data, with additional permissions from Malcom Pierson, Frank Pezold, and Jon Armbruster.

Global circulation models predict a shift in precipitation patterns to growing season rainfall events that are larger in size but fewer in number. This ""repackaging"" of rainfall into large events with long intervening dry intervals could be particularly important in semi-arid grasslands because it is in marked contrast to the frequent but small events that have historically defined this ecosystem. We investigated the effect of more extreme rainfall patterns on ANPP via the use of rainout shelters and paired this experimental manipulation with an investigation of long-term data for ANPP and precipitation. Experimental plots (n = 15) received the long-term (30-year) mean growing season precipitation quantity; however, this amount was distributed as 12, six, or four events applied manually according to seasonal patterns for May-September. The long-term mean (1940-2005) number of rain events in this shortgrass steppe was 14 events, with a minimum of nine events in years of average precipitation. Thus, our experimental treatments pushed this system beyond its recent historical range of variability. Plots receiving fewer, but larger rain events had the highest rates of ANPP (184 +/- 38 g m(-2)), compared to plots receiving more frequent rainfall (105 +/- 24 g m(-2)). ANPP in all experimental plots was greater than long-term mean ANPP for this system (97 g m(-2)), which may be explained in part by the more even distribution of applied rain events. Soil moisture data indicated that larger events led to greater soil water content and likely permitted moisture penetration to deeper in the soil profile. These results indicate that semi-arid grasslands are capable of responding immediately and substantially to forecast shifts to more extreme precipitation patterns.",,,,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008",,Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research Program; Konza Prairie Long Term Ecological Research; USDA Managed Ecosystems; EPA Science To Achieve ResultsUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"Funding for this research was provided by the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research Program, Konza Prairie Long Term Ecological Research Program, the USDA Managed Ecosystems Program (NRI CREES), and an EPA Science To Achieve Results (STAR) fellowship awarded to J.

Here, we consider the ecophysiological and demographic determinants of the distribution of a partial migrant, the North American field sparrow, Spizella pusilla. From 1940 to 1963, the field sparrow extended its winter northern range margin 222 km polewards. Such expansion was coincident with not only a geographical expansion into suitable breeding habitats, but also a decrease in mean abundance across sites occupied during the winter surveys. Combined, these trends suggest that declining populations along the expansion front either stopped migrating or altered their autumn migration. The poleward expansion was not coincident with climatically induced decreases in peak metabolic energy demand, but it did track increases in ecosystem net primary productivity. After 1963, the species' lower lethal temperature prevented further poleward movement. These findings show how different ecophysiological constraints can interact to change migration and distribution in a demographically declining species.",,,,"Hijmans, Robert/N-3299-2016","Hijmans, Robert/0000-0001-5872-2872",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0407971],"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation grant DEB-0407971 and graduate fellowship to W.B.M.

Meat consumption has been increasing at a fantastic rate and is likely to continue to do so into the future. If this demand is to be met, technology used in production in the form of Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) will need to be expanded. This paper estimates future meat consumption and discusses the potential aggregate environmental impact of this production if the use of CAFOs is expanded. I first separate meat into beef, chicken and pig products and estimate the elasticities associated with each product in order to forecast the world demand for meat. Using research on the environmental impact of food production in the US, which uses one of the most efficient CAFO processes in the world, I then calculate the total potential greenhouse emissions of this meat production and discuss the impact of these consumption patterns. I find that, under an expanded CAFO system, meat production in the future will still be a large producer of greenhouse gases, accounting for up to 6.3% of current greenhouse gas emissions in 2030.

Road mortality is among the greatest threats to semi-terrestrial freshwater turtles due to the group's life-history traits. Declining throughout much of their range, spotted (Clemmys guttata) and Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) are exposed to high road densities and traffic volumes in the northeastern United States. We examine the distribution of roadkill risk for spotted and Blanding's turtles at three spatial scales. Tortuosity during upland movements was used to predict road-crossing locations at the single-movement scale. A gravity model of wetland-to-wetland interactions was then developed to identify road mortality hot spots at a broader road segment scale. Finally, road-crossing risk was assessed at the scale of focal areas that support distinct populations, using a population viability analysis to evaluate the consequences of road mortality on resident populations. The observed spatial variability of road mortality risk was high for single road crossing movements, limiting the effectiveness of static mitigation measures conducted at this scale. At the broader road segment scale, road mortality hotspots were evident. The demographic risk associated with roads varied widely among discrete populations, with probabilities of extinction over 100-year projections reaching 5.1% for spotted turtles, and 58.8% for Blanding's turtles. We conclude that conservation interventions are most likely to be effective in mitigating the effects of road mortality when implemented at the road segment and population scales.

We examined the habitat and flower resource occupancy by the invasive introduced bumble bee Bombus terrestris and three dominant native bumble bees in central Hokkaido, northern Japan, in relation to a landscape factor (forest cover ratio) and flower morphology with respect to the proboscis length of bees. Three years of monitoring the invasive boundary of B. terrestris indicated that this species, which dominates open agricultural areas, probably will not invade the forests in which the native species dominate. This habitat partitioning likely followed the displacement of the natives by the invader in open agricultural lands. In forested areas, the native species partitioned flower resources on the basis of the relationship between proboscis length and the lengths of the corolla tubes of flowers. However, in open agricultural areas, both the long- and short-tubed flowers were primarily visited by the exotic short-tongued B. terrestris, which foraged illegitimately (by nectar robbing) on long-tubed flowers (Trifolium pratense L.) and legitimately on short-tubed flowers (T repens L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). The invasion of B. terrestris into open natural vegetation, in addition to open agricultural areas, has recently been reported in Hokkaido. Even though the exotic and dominant native bumble bees partition their habitat according to landscape factors, the invasive bee has the potential to alter the overall interactions within plant-pollinator systems in the regions of open vegetation on Hokkaido island.

Most forecasts are based on climate envelopes (CE), correlative approaches that project future distributions on the basis of the current climate often assuming some dispersal lag. One major caveat with this approach is that it ignores the complexity of factors other than climate that contribute to a species' distributional range. To overcome this limitation and to complement predictions based on CE modeling we carried out a transplant experiment of resident and potential-migrant species. Tree seedlings of 18 species were planted side by side from 2001 to 2004 at several locations in the Southern Appalachians and in the North Carolina Piedmont (USA). Growing seedlings under a large array of environmental conditions, including those forecasted for the next decades, allowed us to model seedling survival as a function of variables characteristic of each site, and from here we were able to make predictions on future seedling recruitment. In general, almost all species showed decreased survival in plots and years with lower soil moisture, including both residents and potential migrants, and in both locations, the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont. The detrimental effects that anticipated arid conditions could have on seedling recruitment contradict some of the projections made by CE modeling, where many of the species tested are expected to increase in abundance or to expand their ranges. These results point out the importance of evaluating the potential sources of migrant species when modeling vegetation response to climate change, and considering that species adapted to the new climate and the local conditions may not be available in the surrounding regions.",,,,"Clark, James S./G-6331-2011; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB9981392, DEB0425465]","This work benefited from the help, advice, and comments of M.

Quantitative models of range expansion have rarely been applied to large vertebrates, although such tools could be useful for restoration and management of many threatened but recovering populations. Using the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) as a case study, we utilized integro-difference equations in combination with a stage-structured projection matrix that incorporated spatial variation in dispersal and demography to make forecasts of population recovery and range recolonization. In addition to these basic predictions, we emphasize how to make these modeling predictions useful in a management context through the inclusion of parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. Our models resulted in hind-cast (1989-2003) predictions of net population growth and range expansion that closely matched observed patterns. We next made projections of future range expansion and population growth, incorporating uncertainty in all model parameters, and explored the sensitivity of model predictions to variation in spatially explicit survival and dispersal rates. The predicted rate of southward range expansion (median = 5.2 km/yr) was sensitive to both dispersal and survival rates; elasticity analysis indicated that changes in adult survival would have the greatest potential effect on the rate of range expansion, while perturbation analysis showed that variation in subadult dispersal contributed most to variance in model predictions. Variation in survival and dispersal of females at the south end of the range contributed most of the variance in predicted southward range expansion. Our approach provides guidance for the acquisition of further data and a means of forecasting the consequence of specific management actions. Similar methods could aid in the management of other recovering populations.",,,,"Tinker, Martin/D-3249-2018; Tinker, Martin/F-1277-2011","Tinker, Martin/0000-0002-3314-839X; ","U. S.

Here, we assess the effect of historical climate data variability when forecasting geographic responses of California mammals to 20th century climate change. We first used two methods to derive gridded climate surfaces from weather station data (ANUSPLIN and PRISM) representing two sampling eras: historic (1900-1940) and current (1980-2005). We then used the two sources of climate data in conjunction with a maximum entropy algorithm (MAXENT) to predict both the historic and current distributions of all major mammal species vouchered historically in California. Results indicate that levels of disagreement between the two climate datasets are considerably greater in the historical era than in the current era. For the bioclimatic variables used in modeling historical mammal distributions, precipitation variables were less concordant than temperature variables. These discrepancies are reflected in the low agreement between historic mammal range predictions and further propagated when the historic models are projected to present day. Nonetheless, some common patterns exist across mammal species and climate estimates. Range stability is the most common prediction between the two eras, followed by expansion and contraction. Jepson ecoregions with relatively high levels of range stability include parts of the Great Central Valley and Sierra Nevada, while other parts of the Central Valley, the Sonoran desert, and Central- and Southwestern California yield predictions of range shifts. Historical species distribution modeling can greatly inform studies attempting to describe how species will continue to move geographically in response to future changes in climate. We suggest that alternative estimates of historical climate and their uncertainties are ultimately required in order to provide a quantitative measure of the confidence in predicted changes in distribution.",,,,,,Museum of Vertebrate Zoology; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0640859],"Support for this research was provided by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and NSF grant DEB 0640859.

These subpopulations are used to manage the sustainable harvest of polar bears in Canada but for conservation purposes the species is Currently considered a single biological unit. Long-term climate warming has reduced the availability of sea ice that polar bears require for feeding, movement and reproduction, and continued declines in ice extent and duration are forecast to have significant negative effects on polar bears in some areas. Under the Canadian Species at Risk Act separate legal protection may be given to intraspecific groups (SO called designatable units, DUs) that are genetically, geographically and/or biogeographically distinct. We examined the conservation status of polar bears across their Canadian range and compared large-scale ecosystem properties across subpopulations. We found that threats to the conservation of polar bears are not spatially uniform and we identified five DUs that captured broad patterns of polar bear biodiversity.

The Success of international scientific collaboration in the IGY led the International Council for Science (ICSU), the body that managed the IGY, to create the Scientific Committee oil Antarctic Research (SCAR) to carry forward the collaboration in Antarctic science that had begun during the IGY. This year, 2008, seems an appropriate time to undertake such an historical review, given that we are not only midway through the fourth IPY, but also that it is SCAR's 50th anniversary; the first SCAR meeting having been held in The Hague on 3-5 February 1958. Since SCAR's membership began with 12 member countries and 4 ICSU unions, membership has grown to 34 countries and 8 ICSU unions, with more expected to join at the 30th meeting of SCAR in Moscow in July 2008. Both SCAR's activities and those of the fourth IPY benefit from international collaboration not only between scientists, but also between the national Antarctic operations managers, working together through the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes (COMNAP), and national policy makers working together through the Antarctic Treaty mechanisms. Thanks to all their efforts, the IPY of 2007-2009 will leave behind a legacy of enhanced observing systems for documenting the status and change of all aspects of the Antarctic environment as the basis for improved forecasting of its future condition. SCAR expects to play a major role in the design of those systems and their use to improve scientific understanding of the place of the Antarctic in the global environmental system, and the pace and direction of change within that system.",,,,,,,,,,16,16,1,13,,,,0032-2474,,,POLAR REC,POLAR REC.,OCT,2008,44,231,,,,,321,334,,10.1017/S0032247408007468,,,,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,,,WOS:000259344000004,,,,,

Threatened species often share similar traits such that if a trait predisposing a species to decline or extinction is evolutionarily conserved, then close relatives of threatened species are themselves likely to be at risk. The phylogenetic distribution of current threat has been argued to provide insight into the species that could be threatened in the future when trait data are not available. Conservation criteria are typically based on multiple indices that capture different symptoms of threat including population trends and range contraction. However, there is no reason to assume consistent phylogenetic distributions of different symptoms. I construct a molecular phylogeny of 249 species of British birds (more than 93% of the breeding and wintering species) and use this to show that the species that are threatened due to population declines are phylogenetically more closely related than expected by chance alone. However, species that are listed for other reasons, including range contraction, are distributed randomly with respect to phylogeny. I suggest that while phylogeny can be informative with respect to identifying clades that are susceptible to some measures of extinction risk, such patterns are likely to be idiosyncratic with respect to symptom and taxa.",,,,"Thomas, Gavin/AAE-8959-2019","Thomas, Gavin/0000-0002-1982-6051",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [cpb010001],,,,49,49,0,9,,,,0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Time series data are compiled for catch, fishing mortality and biomass using fisheries statistics and literature values. Using the assembled dataset, dynamics of the 1950-based simulations are fitted to agree with observations over 50 years to 2000 through the manipulation of trophic flow parameters and the addition of climate factors: a primary production anomaly and herring recruitment anomaly. The predicted climate anomalies reflect documented environmental series, most strongly sea surface temperature and the Pacific Decadal oscillation index. The best-fit predator-prey interaction parameters indicate mixed trophic control of the ecosystem. Trophic flow parameters from the fitted 1950 model are transferred to the other historical periods assuming stationarity in density-dependent foraging tactics. The 1900 model exhibited an improved fit to data using this approach, which suggests that the pattern of trophic control may have remained constant over much of the last century. The 1950 model is driven for-ward 50 years using climate and historical fishing drivers. The resulting ecosystem is compared to the 2000 model, and the dynamics of these models are compared in a predictive forecast to 2050. The models suggest similar restoration trajectories after a hypothetical release from fishing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In order to forecast the potential future of this conflict, we used generalized linear models to relate the presence and absence of pink-footed geese to variables describing the contemporary landscape, and predicted their future distributions in relation to two land-use scenarios for the year 2050. One future scenario represented a global, economically orientated world (A1) and the other represented a regional, environmentally concerned world (B2). The probability of goose occurrence increased within cropland and grassland, and could be explained by their proximity to coast, elevation, and the degree of habitat closure. Predictions to future scenarios revealed noticeable shifts in the suitability of goose habitat evident at the local and regional scale in response to future shifts in land use. In particular, as grasslands and croplands give way to unsuitable land-use types (e.g. woody biofuel crops, increased urbanization, and forest) under both future scenarios, our models predicted a decrease in habitat suitability for geese.

Location North-western Europe. Methods We sampled populations of A. fluviatilis sensu stricto over the entire range of the species (north-western Europe) and sequenced 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial fragments to perform phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses. Climatic niche modelling allowed us to infer the climatic preferences of the species. A principal components analysis identified the most important climatic factors explaining the actual range of A. fluviatilis. We also identified which climatic factor was the most limiting at range margins, and predicted the species' geographical range under a climate change scenario [Community Climate Model 3 (CCM3)]. Results By means of the phylogeographical analysis, we infer that A. fluviatilis sensu stricto occupied northern refuges during the Last Glacial Maximum. We show that the climatic preferences of Baltic populations are significantly different from those of Central European populations. The projection of the occupied area under the CCM3 climate model predicts a moderate poleward shift of the northern range limits, but a dramatic loss of areas currently occupied, for instance in northern Germany and in southern Great Britain. Main conclusions The post-glacial range dynamics of A. fluviatilis are not governed by niche conservatism. Therefore, we must be cautious about bioclimatic model predictions: the expected impact of climate change could be tempered by the adaptive potential this species has already shown in its evolutionary history. Thus, modelling approaches should rather be seen as conservative forecasts of altered species ranges as long as the adaptive potential of the organisms in question cannot be predicted.",,,,"Cordellier, Mathilde/E-7980-2010; Pfenninger, Markus/A-8230-2012","Cordellier, Mathilde/0000-0001-7376-4560; ",,,,,20,20,0,15,,,,0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Survival, life expectancy and life span are key demographic parameters that are essential for understanding life-history evolution and forecasting population dynamics, but empirical data on these parameters is extremely limited for herbaceous species. 2. We used long-term data from annually mapped permanent quadrats in a Kansas, USA, grassland to estimate survival, life expectancy and life span for 29 perennial forbs (herbaceous dicots) and 11 perennial grasses. In the cases of both forbs and grasses, they were the most common species at the research site. 3. We developed computer programs to track the identity of individual genets based on their spatial locations in the permanent quadrats. The programs distinguished between new recruits and surviving individuals, and calculated the ages and life spans of the survivors. 4. Most herbaceous perennials die young; life expectancy at age 1 year ranged from 0.6 to 6.5. However, forbs are more likely to die young than grasses. Survival from age 1 to 2 years for forbs ranged from 0.11 to 0.49 with an average of 0.30, whereas for grasses it ranged from 0.30 to 0.63 with an average of 0.44. Maximum observed life spans ranged from 3 to 25 years for forbs and 5 to 39 years for grasses. 5. All species tended towards Type III survivorship curves, but grasses were more strongly Type III while many forbs had relatively constant survival rates with age. Therefore, population models must account for increasing survival with age, especially for grasses. 6. Age was a better predictor of grass survival than size, raising questions about the use of size-based methods to indirectly estimate survival and life span. 7. Maximum observed life span was positively and significantly related with species importance. 8. Synthesis.

Therefore, the vital question arises: ""Can these influences lead to irreversible negative changes in the climate-biosphere system or a global ecological catastrophe?"" The possibility of irreversible changes may be not very high, but one cannot ignore it. So the main aim of our investigation is to evaluate possible consequences of human impact on the biosphere focusing on irreversible changes of it. Traditional mathematical complicated models describe the biosphere in great detail, but the large number of equations and parameters leads to accumulation of uncertainties in the forecast due to inevitable uncertainties of experimental estimations of model parameters. An approach based on the principle of the worst scenario was proposed. Minimization of mathematical model with respect to this principle is conducted to study limiting (but possible) versions of models in which the contribution of the possible compensatory and smoothing mechanisms is minimal. Namely the most unfavorable scenarios (corresponding to the values of parameters at the boundaries of confidence interval) have to be considered in estimating consequences of anthropogenic impact. One of the fastest CO2 releasing mechanisms, based on the positive feedback effect, was considered in the context of the worst scenario principle. The family of simple mathematical models was created for biosphere dynamics representation on different timescales. The main result of the investigation consists in confirmation of the possibility of negative and irreversible changes in the ""biosphere-climate"" system, caused by amplification of the positive feedback: ""anthropogenic emission Of CO2 - temperature increase - additional CO2 emission due to decomposition of soil organics"". Crucial parameters of models, responsible for avalanche-like biosphere changes, are determined. A realizability of hypotheses on anthropogenic causes of Little Ice Age was estimated by corresponding minimal model. Model were used to show the feasibility of the mechanism describing the changing of agricultural field species into indigenous forests in Europe during the Plague, which led to CO2 decrease and temperature fall.

Range-shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction, often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data, but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species, the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia, assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move, survive, and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally, by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism, trait-based approaches can be used to investigate the range-limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species' potential to evolve at range-edges.

Our aim was to test the plant - soil threshold hypothesis: that changed biotic structure in. uences resilience to accumulated changes in N. For six years, we removed one of two codominant species, Geum rossii and Deschampsia caespitosa, in moistmeadow alpine tundra in Colorado, USA. We also manipulated nutrient availability by adding carbon ( C) or N, separately and in combination with the species removals. Consistent with our hypothesis, Geum was associated with soil feedbacks that slowed rates of N cycling and Deschampsia with feedbacks that increased rates of N cycling. After a fouryear initial resilience period, Geum dramatically declined ( by almost 70%) due to increasing N availability. In contrast, Deschampsia abundance did not respond to changes in N supply; it only responded to the removal of Geum. Forbs and graminoids responded more positively to Deschampsia removal than to Geum removal, indicating stronger competitive effects by Deschampsia. The changed biotic interactions appear to have community- level consequences: after six years of Geum ( but not Deschampsia) removal, evenness of the community declined by over 35%. Increased N affected the soil - microbial feedbacks, particularly in association with Geum. Microbial biomass N declined at higher N, as did the activities of two C- acquiring and one Nacquiring extracellular microbial enzymes. In the presence of Geum, N fertilization slowed the activity of phenol oxidase, a tannin- degrading enzyme, suggesting that microbes shift from degrading Geum- derived compounds. In the absence of Geum, acid phosphatase activity increased, suggesting increased phosphorus limitation in association with Deschampsia. With continued N deposition forecast for this system, these results suggest that initial resilience of Geum to increased N will be overwhelmed through elimination of microbial feedbacks. Once Geum declines, the loss will indirectly facilitate Deschampsia via competitive release. Because Deschampsia exerts strong competitive effects on subordinate species, increased Deschampsia abundance may be accompanied by a community- wide drop in diversity. We conclude that plant - soil feedbacks through the microbial community can in. uence vulnerability to exogenous changes in N and contribute to threshold dynamics.",,,,"Mobley, Megan/AAF-3560-2020; Mobley, Megan/A-5402-2010; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Mobley, Megan/0000-0002-6046-8380; Mobley, Megan/0000-0002-6046-8380; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176",,,,,51,53,5,102,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

In the tropics, because montane assemblages frequently include local endemics that are distributed close to summits, these species may be especially vulnerable to experiencing complete habitat loss from warming. However, there is currently a dearth of information available for tropical regions. Here, we present a preliminary appraisal of this extinction threat using the herpetological assemblage of the Tsaratanana Massif in northern Madagascar (the island's highest massif), which is rich with montane endemism. We present meteorological evidence (individual and combined regional weather station data and reanalysis forecast data) for recent warming in Madagascar, and show that this trend is consistent with recent climate model simulations. Using standard moist adiabatic lapse rates, these observed meteorological warming trends in northern Madagascar predict upslope species displacement of 17-74 m per decade between 1993 and 2003. Over this same period, we also report preliminary data supporting a trend for upslope distribution movements, based on two surveys we completed at Tsaratanana. For 30 species, representing five families of reptiles and amphibians, we found overall mean shifts in elevational midpoint of 19-51 m upslope (mean lower elevation limit 29-114 m; mean upper elevation limit -8 to 53 m). We also found upslope trends in mean and median elevational observations in seven and six of nine species analysed. Phenological differences between these surveys do not appear to be substantial, but these upslope shifts are consistent with the predictions based on meteorological warming. An elevational range displacement analysis projects complete habitat loss for three species below the 2 degrees C 'dangerous' warming threshold. One of these species is not contracting its distribution, but the other two were not resampled in 2003. A preliminary review of the other massifs in Madagascar indicates potential similar vulnerability to habitat loss and upslope extinction. Consequently, we urgently recommend additional elevational surveys for these and other tropical montane assemblages, which should also include, when possible, the monitoring of local meteorological conditions and habitat change.",,,,,"Stone, Daithi/0000-0002-2518-100X",,,,,195,204,1,108,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, generality is the most often neglected one of the three criteria for model validation: reality; precision and generality. The paper suggests to validate models for lake ecosystem categories defined by (a) circulation types of lakes that to some degree reflect climate and morphometry and (b) trophic states of lakes that to some degree reflect community structures and habitat properties. Two models are tested for South African lakes belonging to the category of warm-monomictic and hypertrophic lakes: the deterministic simulation library SALMO-OO and a rule-based agent for Microcystis discovered by evolutionary computation. SALMO-OO is an object-oriented implementation of mass balance equations for a typical pelagic food web (diatoms, green algae, blue-green algae, and cladocerans) and nutrient cycles (PO4-P, NO3-N, detritus) as well as alternative process models for algal growth and grazing, zooplankton growth and mortality. During validation the best performing model structure is determined for a number of lakes belonging to the same category. SALMO-OO is implemented in JAVA providing an interactive user-interface. The rule-based Microcystis agent has been discovered by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA after training by merged time series data of three lakes belonging to the same category and 14-fold cross-validation for data of all 14 years of each lake. The agent allows 7-days-ahead forecasting of Microcystis abundance for any of the three lakes. It can be concluded that the design and validation of models for ecosystem categories improves the generality of models, and promotes both model as well as data sharing. Future work will focus on distinctive ecological features of ecosystem categories to be considered in informed structure design and validation of category models.

Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we demonstrate this effect under a wide variety of population growth rates and dispersal costs. We then test the possibility of an evolved shift in dispersal kernels by measuring dispersal rates in individual cane toads (Bufo marinus) from invasive populations in Australia (historically, toads advanced their range at 10 km/year, but now they achieve 155 km/year in the northern part of their range). Under a common-garden design, we found a steady increase in dispersal tendency with distance from the invasion origin. Dispersal kernels on the invading front were less kurtotic and less skewed than those from origin populations. Thus, toads have increased their rate of range expansion partly through increased dispersal on the expanding front.

Appropriate guidance relating to risk assessments of established botanical garden collections is often scarce. This paper uses the Amani Botanical Garden (ABG), Tanzania, as a case study to highlight appropriate methods to assess the risks posed by existing and future collections in tropical botanical gardens. Key considerations included field assessments of species status using accepted definitions of naturalisation, spread and invasion, distinguishing between intentionally and unintentionally introduced species, identifying taxonomic patterns in invasion status, assessing patterns in habitats colonised, and determining how knowledge of invasion elsewhere might be useful in forecasting risk. Out of the 214 alien plant species surviving from the original plantings in the early 20th century, 35 had only regenerated, 38 had locally naturalised while 16 had spread widely in the botanical garden. A further 16 species with unclear introduction records in the garden were also found to be naturalised. A greater proportion of introduced species were potentially invasive than might be expected from previous analyses of global floras. Overall, just over half of all naturalised and spreading species were also observed in forest fragments and edges. The proportion of species that had been recorded elsewhere as naturalised/invasive was significantly related to their status in ABG, with 94% of spreading species and 79% of naturalising species being recorded as naturalised or invasive elsewhere, compared to 57% of species that were only regenerating and 49% of species only surviving.

Variation in climate is predicted to increase over much of the planet this century. Forecasting species persistence with climate change thus requires understanding of how populations respond to climate variability, and the mechanisms underlying this response. Variable rainfall is well known to drive fluctuations in annual plant populations, yet the degree to which population response is driven by between-year variation in germination cueing, water limitation or competitive suppression is poorly understood. 2. We used demographic monitoring and population models to examine how three seed banking, rare annual plants of the California Channel Islands respond to natural variation in precipitation and their competitive environments. Island plants are particularly threatened by climate change because their current ranges are unlikely to overlap regions that are climatically favourable in the future. 3. Species showed 9 to 100-fold between-year variation in plant density over the 5-12 years of censusing, including a severe drought and a wet El Nino year. During the drought, population sizes were low for all species. However, even in non-drought years, population sizes and per capita growth rates showed considerable temporal variation, variation that was uncorrelated with total rainfall. These population fluctuations were instead correlated with the temperature after the first major storm event of the season, a germination cue for annual plants. 4. Temporal variation in the density of the focal species was uncorrelated with the total vegetative cover in the surrounding community, suggesting that variation in competitive environments does not strongly determine population fluctuations. At the same time, the uncorrelated responses of the focal species and their competitors to environmental variation may favour persistence via the storage effect. 5. Population growth rate analyses suggested differential endangerment of the focal annuals. Elasticity analyses and life table response experiments indicated that variation in germination has the same potential as the seeds produced per germinant to drive variation in population growth rates, but only the former was clearly related to rainfall. 6. Synthesis. Our work suggests that future changes in the timing and temperatures associated with the first major rains, acting through germination, may more strongly affect population persistence than changes in season-long rainfall.",,,,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",,,,,79,81,1,70,,,,0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Model dynamics have been tuned to agree with local catch and relative biomass time series data developed for this project, and validated by experts. The model is used in this article to investigate five high priority research questions related to ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) in the region. Regency fisheries managers and scientific partners working in Indonesia posed the questions. Here, we analyze the ecosystem impacts of blast fishing, including trophic effects and removal of refuge space. Removal of refuge space is as harmful to juvenile reef fish populations as direct mortality from the fishery itself, reef damage is cumulative due to the slow re-growth rate of corals. We quantify the likely ecological and economic impacts of limiting commercial fisheries for groupers. Artisanal fisheries benefit slightly and system biodiversity is improved, but the improvement is lost if artisanal fisheries increase effort to compensate for missing catch. We forecast the effects of limiting commercial net fisheries for reef fish. There is a marginal increase in reef fish biomass and an unexpected benefit to large pelagic species due to reduced interception of their anchovy prey. We evaluate the exploitation status of anchovy and tuna and report on the ecosystem effects of these fisheries. All fisheries appear fully exploited in Raja Ampat or nearly so. There is an indication that anchovies provide an ecosystem service: a large population may act to buffer fluctuations in large pelagic fish biomass under climate variation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We examine an outbreak of mountain pine beetle covering an 800 thousand ha area on the Chilcotin Plateau of British Columbia, Canada, during the 1970s and early 1980s. We present a model that incorporates the spatial and temporal arrangements of outbreaking insect populations, as well as various climatic factors that influence insect development. Onsets of eruptions of mountain pine beetle demonstrated landscape-level synchrony. On average, the presence of outbreaking populations was highly correlated with outbreaking populations within the nearest 18 km the same year and local populations within 6 km in the previous two years. After incorporating these spatial and temporal dependencies, we found that increasing temperatures contributed to explaining outbreak probabilities during this 15 yr outbreak. During collapse years, landscape-level synchrony declined while local synchrony values remained high, suggesting that in some areas host depletion was contributing to population decline. Model forecasts of outbreak propensity one year in advance at a 12 by 12 km scale provided 80% accuracy over the landscape, and never underestimated the occurrence of locally outbreaking populations.

As a result, research challenges and environmental problems must be tackled at local, regional, and global scales. Ecosystem responses to land change are complex and interacting, occurring on all spatial and temporal scales as a consequence of connectivity of resources, energy, and information among social, physical, and biological systems. We propose six hypotheses about local to continental effects of urbanization and pollution, and an operational research approach to test them. This approach focuses on analysis of ""megapolitan"" areas that have emerged across North America, but also includes diverse wildland-to-urban gradients and spatially continuous coverage of land change.

Such projections are complicated by change in the connectivity of resources, particularly water, nutrients, and propagules, that influences the way ecological responses scale from local. to regional and from regional to continental. This paper describes ecological responses to expected changes in four key meso-scale drivers that influence the ecosystems of the North American continental interior: drought, warming, snowpack disappearance, and altered fire regimes. Changes in these drivers will affect, for example, atmospheric smoke, dust, and reactive nitrogen concentrations; stream discharge; nitrate concentrations; sediment loads; and the vector-borne spread of invasive species and infectious diseases. A continental network of sensors and simulation models is required to detect changes in the transport vectors - atmospheric, hydrologic, and mechanized that connect spatial scales.

Forecasts based on bioclimatic envelop modeling of distributions of species suggests greater impacts can be expected in the future, but such projections are contingent on assumptions regarding future climate and migration rates of species. Here, we present a first assessment of the potential impact of climate change on a global biodiversity hotspot in southwestern Western Australia. Across three representative scenarios of future climate change, we simulated migration of 100 Banksia (Proteaceae) species at a rate of 5 km decade(-1) and compared projected impacts with those under the commonly applied, but acknowledged as inadequate, assumptions of 'full-' and 'no-migration.' Across all climate x migration scenarios, 66% of species were projected to decline, whereas only 6% were projected to expand or remain stable. Between 5% and 25% of species were projected to suffer range losses of 100% by 2080, depending mainly on climate scenario. Species losses were driven primarily by changes in current precipitation regimes, with the greatest losses of species projected to occur in a transition zone between wet coastal areas and interior arid regions and which is projected to become more arid in the future. Because the ranges of most species tended to collapse in all climate scenarios, we found that climate change impacts to flora of southwestern Western Australia may be large, even under optimistic assumptions regarding migration abilities. Taken together, our results suggest that the future of biodiversity in southwestern Western Australia may lie largely in the degree to which this hotspot experiences increased drought and in the ability of species to tolerate such decreases in precipitation. More broadly, our study is among a growing number of theoretical studies suggesting the impacts of future climate change on global biodiversity may be considerable.",,,,"Dunn, Robert/B-1360-2013; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009; Fitzpatrick, Matt/F-7620-2010","Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731; Fitzpatrick, Matt/0000-0003-1911-8407; Dunn, Robert/0000-0002-6030-4837",,,,,149,161,4,100,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Thus, boreal or arctic species are especially susceptible to the effects of climate warming. In this work we forecasted changes in the distributions of 27 northern land bird species in the 21st century, based on predicted rates of climate change. We used climate and bird atlas data of Finland and northern Norway from 1971-1990 to establish bioclimatic envelope models for each species. Next, these models were applied to two climate scenarios (A2 and B1) from the general circulation model HadCM3 to forecast potential future distributions of the study species over a larger area also covering parts of nearby Sweden and Russia. This area stretches through the boreal and continental arctic zone in northern Europe. In the A2 scenario the predicted global change in mean temperature is 3.8 degrees C by 2100 and in the B1 scenario 2.0 degrees C. Our results suggest that most of the northern land bird species will lose most of their climatic space by 2080 both in the more severe (A2, average predicted range decline: -83.6%) and in the less severe scenario (B1, average change: -73.6%). A large proportion (over two thirds) of the species considered here is thus susceptible to major range contractions in this geographical region. These climate change-induced threats are of importance because the Arctic Ocean represents a natural barrier for northward movement of species. To reduce the negative effects of climate change on the northern species, relatively large areas of continuous habitats in a connected reserve network should be preserved. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the effects of soil temperature (14, 20, 26 degrees C) on the structure and extent of a multispecies community of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associated with Plantago lanceolata. To isolate fungi from roots, we used a mesh-divided pot system with separate hyphal compartments near and away from the plant. A C-13 pulse label was then used to trace the flow of recently fixed photosynthate from plants into belowground pools and respiration. Temperature significantly altered the structure and allocation of the AM hyphal network, with a switch from more vesicles (storage) in cooled soils to more extensive extraradical hyphal networks (growth) in warmed soils. As soil temperature increased, we also observed an increase in the speed at which plant photosynthate was transferred to and respired by roots and AM fungi coupled with an increase in the amount of carbon respired per unit hyphal length. These differences were largely independent of plant size and rates of photosynthesis. In a warmer world, we would therefore expect more carbon losses to the atmosphere from AM fungal respiration, which are unlikely to be balanced by increased growth of AM fungal hyphae.",,,,"Hartley, Iain P/J-7892-2016","Hartley, Iain P/0000-0002-9183-6617; Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469",,,,,89,103,3,142,,,,1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Methods: Assessments of understorey vegetation communities were taken prior to anthropogenic disturbances and at three subsequent time periods representing a period of 15 years post-disturbance. Dissimilarities were calculated from the original assessment and modelled in a Bayesian framework to examine the influence of logging, number of prescribed burns and time. Results: All sites underwent significant changes over time independently of the imposed management regimes. Logging resulted in an immediate change in vegetation assemblage which decreased in the subsequent assessments. The number of prescribed fires brought greater change in the shrub vegetation assemblages, but less change in the ground species vegetation assemblages. Conclusions: The anthropogenic disturbances did have some role in the changes of vegetation assemblages but these were minimal. The ongoing changes appear to be a natural response to the last wildfire, which passed through the study area in 1973 (13 years prior to the study).

To deal with these issues, managers routinely employ models to project the response of ecosystems to different scenarios that represent alternative management plans or environmental forecasts. Scenario analysis is often used to rank such alternatives to aid the decision making process. However, model projections are subject to uncertainty in assumptions about model structure, parameter values, environmental inputs, and subcomponent interactions. We introduce an approach for testing the robustness of model-based management decisions to the uncertainty inherent in complex ecological models and their inputs. We use relative assessment to quantify the relative impacts of uncertainty on scenario ranking. To illustrate our approach we consider uncertainty in parameter values and uncertainty in input data, with specific examples drawn from the Florida Everglades restoration project. Our examples focus on two alternative 30-year hydrologic management plans that were ranked according to their overall impacts on wildlife habitat potential. We tested the assumption that varying the parameter settings and inputs of habitat index models does not change the rank order of the hydrologic plans. We compared the average projected index of habitat potential for four endemic species and two wading-bird guilds to rank the plans, accounting for variations in parameter settings and water level inputs associated with hypothetical future climates. Indices of habitat potential were based on projections from spatially explicit models that are closely tied to hydrology. For the American alligator, the rank order of the hydrologic plans was unaffected by substantial variation in model parameters. By contrast, simulated major shifts in water levels led to reversals in the ranks of the hydrologic plans in 24.1-30.6% of the projections for the wading bird guilds and several individual species. By exposing the differential effects of uncertainty, relative assessment can help resource managers assess the robustness of scenario choice in model-based policy decisions.",,,,,"Fuller, Michael/0000-0003-2072-8245",,,,,21,21,0,21,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In the case of the Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi, fishery in Canada, a forecast of the abundance of each herring stock is particularly important for formulating an annual catch quota. The sustainable management of the fishery and the resource is based in part on accurate recruitment forecasting because Pacific herring are short-lived and so the recruitment contributes a significant part of the total spawning run targeted by the fishery each year. Several factors are believed be important in determining the success of recruitment besides spawners biomass. Since herrings are ""r"" strategists, conditions related to the egg, the planktonic, or even the juvenile stage might determine the future level of recruitment. Recently a formula that defines conditions for a semi-quantitative level of recruitment forecast was elaborated using genetic algorithms and current study attempts to improve on this model. Using salinity in two quarterly periods during the planktonic and pre-recruit stages, temperature and spawning biomass for the west coast of Vancouver Island stock, classification rules that define recruitment in 3 different levels (low, medium and high) were developed with a genetic algorithm, setting low and high boundaries for each condition. A 75% success in classifying recruitment was obtained. The model was shown to be particularly effective at predicting when the recruitment would be low, which could be important from the perspective of the Precautionary Approach and the sustainable management of this stock.

This lack of clear understanding limits the ability to forecast carbon (C) cycle responses to temperature changes. Here, we derive a novel approach (denoted Q(10-q)) that accounts for changes in OM quality during decomposition and use it to analyze data from three independent sources. Results from new laboratory soil incubations (labile Q(10-q)=2.1 +/- 0.2; more resistant Q(10-q)=3.8 +/- 0.3) and reanalysis of data from other soil incubations reported in the literature (labile Q(10-q)=2.3; more resistant Q(10-q)=3.3) demonstrate that temperature sensitivity of soil OM decomposition increases with decreasing soil OM lability. Analysis of data from a cross-site, field litter bag decomposition study (labile Q(10-q)=3.3 +/- 0.2; resistant Q(10-q)=4.9 +/- 0.2) shows that litter OM follows the same pattern, with greater temperature sensitivity for more resistant litter OM. Furthermore, the initial response of cultivated soils, presumably containing less labile soil OM (Q(10-q)=2.4 +/- 0.3) was greater than that for undisturbed grassland soils (Q(10-q)=1.7 +/- 0.1). Soil C losses estimated using this approach will differ from previous estimates as a function of the magnitude of the temperature increase and the proportion of whole soil OM comprised of compounds sensitive to temperature over that temperature range. It is likely that increased temperature has already prompted release of significant amounts of C to the atmosphere as CO2.

Do very small ( cm) and meso-scale ( m) variations in the physical environment influence this process and subsequent vegetation development? Location: Mount Hekla, southern Iceland (64 degrees 00' N, 19 degrees 40' W). Methods: Data on vegetation structure and the incidence of 'safe sites' suitable for colonisation were collected from high and low points on the surfaces of lava flows emplaced during the 1991 and 2000 A. D. eruptions of Mount Hekla. Effects of flow age and meso-topographic position on vegetation structure ( moss cover, patch density, stem length) were assessed by two-way analyses of variance. The distributions of colonisation events and available safe sites were analysed using point pattern techniques. Results: Rapid colonisation of the lava surface was observed, despite stressful environmental conditions. The 1991 and 2000 flows differed significantly in vegetation structure, but there were no significant differences in moss cover, patch density and stem length between 'high' and 'low' sites. Conclusions: Colonisation events are invariably associated with small-scale irregularities on the surface of the lava. The colonisation process appears to be spatially random. Development of the moss 'carpet' proceeds by vertical thickening and lateral growth and coalescence of moss patches that establish in 'safe sites'. This process is rapid, with close to 100% of available safe sites exploited within 20 years. Topographic position makes no difference to the very early stages of vegetation development and cannot be used to 'forecast' the later stages of development.",,,,"Belyea, Lisa/A-9572-2008; Belyea, Lisa R./R-1174-2019","Belyea, Lisa/0000-0002-9964-2913; Belyea, Lisa R./0000-0002-9964-2913; Cutler, Nick/0000-0003-1746-7769",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/J/S/2001/00799/2],,,,20,25,0,17,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

In recent years, a large quantity of ecological data has been globally accumulated in habitats monitored by Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), and that data enabled ecologists to apply non-linear data-driven ecological modelling algorithms to their systems. Numerous studies have reported that empirical modelling algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were superior to conventional models in applicability, especially for systems where underlying ecological relationship was not fully understood. However, in order to process sufficient information from the target ecosystem or entity, the size of empirical models tended to become larger by applying diverse state variables or forcing functions to the models. Despite the fact that the developed models empirically had accurate performance in prediction or classification of target data, they are occasionally not free from complex structures (e.g., large number of input variables). The TARNN algorithm used in this study can be an alternative solution to overcome the increasing size and structural complexity of the models, based on model performance, which is hardly found in freshwater ecology. In this study, the performance of TARNN for freshwater ecological data was evaluated by being applied to two types of data sets of phytoplankton dynamics. The first data encompassed intensive seasonality (monthly averaged biovolume of Stephanodiscus hantzschii) which proliferated and dominated the algal assemblage (ca. 90%) annually in the lower Nakdong River during winters. The other data was daily sampled phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in which significant seasonality did not reside. The predictability of two TARNN models was compared with appropriate statistical models, i.e., data with seasonality was modelled by Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the other data with Simple Exponential Smoothing. In both cases of data sets, the TARNN models outperformed the statistical methods in accuracy of prediction (TARNN, r(2) > 0.9 for both seasonal and non-seasonal testing data sets; both statistical models, r(2) < 0.3 for the testing data sets). Especially, the capacity of prediction using the TARNN algorithm was not decreased by the absence of seasonality. Through the presented results, it can be assumed that TARNN can process non-linear autoregressive analysis successfully for ecological data. The development of non-linear autoregressive models for phytoplankton prediction can suggest more efficient direction for water quality management approaches of freshwater systems with long-term database. A real-time forecasting system for algal proliferation, one of the state-of-the-art predicting systems, can be identified using the linkage between the modelling technique and telemetry.

Here, we use niche modeling augmented by dispersal estimation to examine the degree to which local habitat conditions vs. force of infection predict invasion of Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of the emerging infectious tree disease sudden oak death. We sampled 890 field plots for the presence of P. ramorum over a three-year period (2003-2005) across a range of host and abiotic conditions with variable proximities to known infections in California, USA. We developed and validated generalized linear models of invasion probability to analyze the relative predictive power of 12 niche variables and a negative exponential dispersal kernel estimated by likelihood pro. ling. Models were developed incrementally each year (2003, 2003-2004, 2003-2005) to examine annual variability in model parameters and to create realistic scenarios for using models to predict future infections and to guide early-detection sampling. Overall, 78 new infections were observed up to 33.5 km from the nearest known site of infection, with slightly increasing rates of prevalence across time windows (2003, 6.5%; 2003-2004, 7.1%; 2003-2005, 9.6%). The pathogen was not detected in many field plots that contained susceptible host vegetation. The generalized linear modeling indicated that the probability of invasion is limited by both dispersal and niche constraints. Probability of invasion was positively related to precipitation and temperature in the wet season and the presence of the inoculum-producing foliar host Umbellularia californica and decreased exponentially with distance to inoculum sources. Models that incorporated niche and dispersal parameters best predicted the locations of new infections, with accuracies ranging from 0.86 to 0.90, suggesting that the modeling approach can be used to forecast locations of disease spread. Application of the combined niche plus dispersal models in a geographic information system predicted the presence of P. ramorum across; 8228 km 2 of California's 84 785 km 2 (9.7%) of land area with susceptible host species. This research illustrates how probabilistic modeling can be used to analyze the relative roles of niche and dispersal limitation in controlling the distribution of invasive pathogens.",,,,,"Meentemeyer, Ross/0000-0002-1247-6212",,,,,73,74,3,43,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

However, future. re activity could well be within the range of values experienced during the preindustrial period. In this study, we contrast 21st century forecasts of. re occurrence (FireOcc, number of large forest. res per year) in the southern part of the Boreal Shield, Canada, with the historical range of the past 240 years statistically reconstructed from tree-ring width data. First, a historical relationship between drought indices and FireOcc is developed over the calibration period 1959-1998. Next, together with seven tree-ring based drought reconstructions covering the last 240 years and simulations from the CGCM3 and ECHAM4 global climate models, the calibration model is used to estimate past (prior to 1959) and future (post 1999) FireOcc. Last, time-dependent changes in mean FireOcc and in the occurrence rate of extreme. re years are evaluated with the aid of advanced methods of statistical time series analysis. Results suggest that the increase in precipitation projected toward the end of the 21st century will be insufficient to compensate for increasing temperatures and will be insufficient to maintain potential evapotranspiration at current levels. Limited moisture availability would cause FireOcc to increase as well. But will future FireOcc exceed its historical range? The results obtained from our approach suggest high probabilities of seeing future FireOcc reach the upper limit of the historical range. Predictions, which are essentially weighed on northwestern Ontario and eastern boreal Manitoba, indicate that, by 2061-2100, typical FireOcc could increase by more than 34% when compared with the past two centuries. Increases in. re activity as projected by this study could negatively affect the implementation in the next century of forest management inspired by historical or natural disturbance dynamics. This approach is indeed feasible only if current and future. re activities are sufficiently low compared with the preindustrial. re activity, so a substitution of. re by forest management could occur without elevating the overall frequency of disturbance.

In this study, we use spatially explicit parcel-level data to examine the influence of land use (including urban, rural-residential, and vineyard) on salmon spawning substrate quality in tributaries of the Russian River in California. We develop a land use change model to forecast the probability of losses in high-quality spawning habitat and recommend priority areas for incentive-based land conservation efforts. Ordinal logistic regression results indicate that all three land use types were negatively associated with spawning substrate quality, with urban development having the largest marginal impact. For two reasons, however, forecasted rural-residential and vineyard development have much larger influences on decreasing spawning substrate quality relative to urban development. First, the land use change model estimates 10 times greater land use conversion to both rural-residential and vineyard compared to urban. Second, forecasted urban development is concentrated in the most developed watersheds, which already have poor spawning substrate quality, such that the marginal response to future urban development is less significant. To meet the goals of protecting salmonid spawning habitat and optimizing investments in salmon recovery, we suggest investing in watersheds where future rural-residential development and vineyards threaten high-quality fish habitat, rather than the most developed watersheds, where land values are higher.",,,,"Newburn, David A/C-9182-2014","Newburn, David A/0000-0002-6662-3660",,,,,29,30,2,34,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The term ""first flood event"" refers to the response to the first rainfall event after a long dry period which has a major impact on river nutrient loads. The HSPF model had been calibrated with data for 2 years (2000-2001) and verified using data for a further year for a sub-catchment of the Iskar River (from the source to Iskar reservoir). In order to test the ability of HSPF to describe nutrient pollution during a flood event, the calibrated daily time step model was run for such an event with two time steps-daily and hourly. The results of the hydrologic simulation gave a difference in water balance for the period of less than 5%. Percentage differences between observed and simulated values for the nitrogen load were calculated as 13.1% and 18% for hourly and daily simulations, respectively. Percentage differences between phosphorus measured and simulated loads were larger at 16.6% and 34.4%.

Such effect is reduced for firms with extensive analyst following and in environmentally sensitive industries. However, these relationships are shown to be starker in Europe than in North America, i.e., environmental disclosure has a greater impact on analysts' forecasts but is also more greatly attenuated by analyst following and membership in an environmentally sensitive industry.

These ecosystems feature a combination of sinuous creek beds with wide lateral wetlands interspersed with mud flats and oyster reefs. Previous studies demonstrated negative relationships between habitat quality and indicators of watershed urbanization. However, predicting trends in ecological robustness for a number of irregularly branched tidal ecosystems with different watershed attributes, material inputs, and flushing is a difficult task. This study began to address this task by using a simulation framework to assess water column and sediment ecological processes in two distinct tidal creek ecosystems in South Carolina (Malind Creek versus Okatee Creek). Biogeochemical cycling in these creeks fluctuates with hourly, daily, and seasonal changes in tidal exchange, freshwater and material inputs, and autochthonous primary production. Over 2 years simulation based on 2001-2002 input data an estimated 4-5 times more freshwater entered Okatee Creek than Malind Creek even though Okatee Creek watershed and basin areas are only 2.5X larger. Phytoplankton consumed approximately 70% of all water column dissolved nitrogen annually with autochthonous production the primary source of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (OC) to the sediments. Okatee Creek had approximately 7X the net deposition of OC to the sediments were it combined with sediment microalgal biomass to drive benthic secondary production. Differences in physical transport in salt marsh dominated tidal creeks influence the capacity to process, transform, and sequester introduced materials. Modifications to the simulation model will include improved depth, volume, and tidal exchange for more realistic prediction of effective concentrations. This modeling framework connects watershed and atmospheric material loading to estuarine productivity has been used to assess differences in ecosystem metabolism with changes in environmental drivers, and provides the foundation for a suite of sub-models to forecast the potential effects of relative sea level rise for a variety of nearshore environments.

A considerable amount of data on various life stages of lobsters has been collected for research, management and conservation purposes over the past 15 years. We have used these data sets to develop models that simulate lobster populations from newly hatched larval stage through settlement and recruitment to the fishery. This paper presents a part of the synthesis study that focuses on the early life history of lobsters. A coupled biophysical individual based model was developed that considers patterns of egg production (abundance, distribution and timing of hatch), temperature-dependent larval growth, stage-explicit vertical distributions of larvae, and mortality. The biophysical model was embedded in the realistic simulations of the physical environment (current and temperature) from the Gulf of Maine Nowcast/Forecast System. The predominant direction of larval movement follows the cyclonic Gulf of Maine Coastal Current (GMCC). Results show relatively low accumulation of planktonic stages along the eastern Maine coast and high accumulation along the western Maine coast. In years when the eastern branch of the GMCC turns offshore southeast of Penobscot Bay, more particles accumulate downstream of the branch point. Interannual variability is also apparent in development times that vary as a function of year-to-year water temperature variation. The larval stages tend to remain relatively near shore, but the final planktonic stage (the postlarva) resides near the sea surface, and the prevailing southwesterly winds in summer cause eastward and offshore drift of postlarvae.

It covers the Baltic Sea and part of the North Sea. The system is available over the internet and has the latest weather and ocean forecasts, thus giving the user the best possible decision tool in an oil combating situation. The drift model calculates the three-dimensional movements of substances or objects at sea, including sinking, stranding and turbulent dispersion. For oils the evaporation, emulsification and wave-induced vertical dispersion are also calculated. Seatrack Web is the HELCOM system for forecasting of oil drift, and the primary users are oil combating authorities in the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea. It has been in operation since the early 90s. The system now includes several new features, where a coupling to an AIS (Automatic Identification System) ship track data base is the most important. When finding a spill in the sea, it is possible to make a backtracking calculation with the system. The result shows every hour the location of the oil back in time. Adding AIS data to those oiled areas shows clearly which ships have been close to the oil during the whole calculation period. The system then fetches new ship tracks in space and time depending on the changing positions of the oil. A large number of possible ships are often found, and those can then be deleted successively after analyses and more information about the circumstances. The first year of experience with using AIS in Seatrack Web have led to many suggestions for improvement. It now, for instance works faster to identify the suspected ships and it is also easier to ignore irrelevant ships. One valuable new feature is that if AIS data is missing it is possible to take those data from the log book and fill in so the ship track will be completed, thus having correct information when analysing the situation. During 2008 satellite information will be shown in the map, which simplifies the identification of illegal polluters even further. The satellite image can also show an ongoing release of a spill, by showing a ship connected to the oil while releasing it. Two radar satellites will be used, Radarsat 1 and Envisat. A case with all information included can also be saved to show as evidence in court at later occasions as animation or special pictures.",,,,,,,,,,3,3,0,1,,,,,,978-1-4244-2267-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,168,176,,,,,,"Ecology; Engineering, Marine",,,WOS:000262477400027,,,,,

These systems are under the influence of land through the rivers and have a restricted and temporally variable water exchange with the seas or the oceans. Estuarine lagoons are generally productive ecosystems which offer habitats for many species. Many coastal and estuarine lagoons are known to be important components of the natural capital providing opportunities for aquaculture. These ecosystems are difficult to analyze. Like most of the transitional waters, their trophic and ecological status cannot be defined easily because of their complexity. Most of them are usually under strong human influence or already modified heavily, which makes this task even more difficult. Nutrient Phytoplankton Zooplankton Detritus (NPZD) models can help scientists to analyze the full picture of an aquatic system, together with physical, chemical and biological processes, to fill in the gaps of data between samplings and to forecast environmental changes and use this output for planning. Traditionally, these models have been developed and used by engineers extensively, usually with the aim of water resources and quality management. However, different needs may arise in ecological studies with different aims such as better understanding how an aquatic ecosystem works or analyze the interactions in an aquatic food web. In this case, different state variables may be needed than the conventional ones, which are used by more general water quality models that are available. In ecological studies, related to coastal lagoon ecosystems organism groups on the higher trophic levels can be of interest. In this study, an NPZD model and a trophic network model that contains organism groups on the higher trophic levels were linked using the ""bottom-up control"" approach. Such a linkage of models provides the possibility to use the advantages of both models; reproducing of the erratic behavior of nutrients and plankton as realistic as possible, while still taking the more complex organisms in the trophic network, which respond to external forcing in a larger time scale. The models developed in this study were applied to the Curonian Lagoon that is an important estuarine ecosystem for Lithuania.",,,,"Erturk, Ali/AAD-7746-2020",,,,,,0,0,1,6,,,,,,978-1-4244-2267-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,471,+,,,,,,"Ecology; Engineering, Marine",,,WOS:000262477400073,,,,,

Secondly the project was to, within its scope, perform a crude validation of the results. The final task for the project, which lasted until the end of December, was to present the results on the internal web. The system was based on the coupling between the ocean model HIROMB and the biogeochemical model SCOBI. The operational three-dimensional baroclinic ocean model HIROMB (High Resolution Operational Model for the Baltic Sea) covers the whole North Sea/Baltic Sea area and is run operationally in the resolutions 1, 3 and 12 nm. In the test system the 3 nm resolution was coupled, through turbulence and advection, to the one-dimensional biogeochemical model SCOBI (Swedish Coastal and Ocean Blogeochemical model) to form a forecast system for algae blooms in Skagerrak, Kattegat and the Baltic Sea. The SCOBI model includes the following variables: NO3, NH4, PO4, O2, H2S, detritus, diatoms, flagellates, cyanobacteria, zooplankton, bottom nitrogen and bottom phosphorus, of which only algae concentration was presented in this first stage. The forcing of the system was based upon HIRLAM C22 (High Resolution Limited Area Model, resolution 22 km) for the atmospheric parameters (wind and cloudiness) and HBV-Baltic (parted into 43 different sub-basins representing runoff areas) for fresh-water runoff and nutrients (phosphate, nitrate). For water level, including tides at the open sea border towards the NE Atlantic, the storm surge model NOAMOD was used and salinity and temperature at the open boundaries were based on monthly mean values. The set-up of the system was successfully performed and a crude validation for a nine-year hindcast period implied reasonable results. The project will during 2008 continue with the set-up of operational daily runs which will be presented together with satellite images on the internal web (accessible also by an external reference panel) and with further validation of the forecasts.

While many established time series modelling approaches transform the data to stationarity a priori, the explicit modelling and presentation of the non-stationary components of the series in this application is essential to allow for further understanding of variability and hence more informed policies. The Hierarchical Profiling Approach (HPA) was used to model the multi-year daily air quality data gathered at St. Leonards in Edinburgh, UK spanning from 1st of March 2004 to 15th July 2007. The HPA is an avant-garde approach that explicitly models the non stationary component of time series data at different levels depending on the span of the component, so that within-year disturbances are at Level 1 and year-long variability such as seasonality is at Level 2, and so on. HPA decomposes the variability into deterministic, stochastic and noise and uses continuous models to describe the non-stationary components using the deterministic part of the model. The stationary stochastic component is then modelled using established approaches. The dataset modelled was the total daily concentrations of carbon monoxide. After modelling within-year events at Level 1, a harmonic regression with trend model was used to describe the weekly aggregates of the data at Level 2. This model was then sampled back in the daily domain and no evidence of a larger cyclical component was found. Wind-speed and a dummy intervention-variable indicating the implementation of the smoking ban were considered in a transfer function model.

Recently we have incorporated an adapted version of the CFD model MIMO (University of Karlsruhe, 2000) which includes a sophisticated cellular traffic model, CAMO (UPM, 2006), to model street level pollution with the numerical Eulerian models approach with a few meters of spatial resolution. The integrated system formed by an adapted version of MIMO and CAMO is called MICROSYS. The mesoscale air quality model MM5-CMAQ-EMIMO produces air concentrations in real-time and forecasting mode for urban and regional areas with I km spatial resolution. The MICROSYS model is implemented to simulate the air concentrations in one I km grid cell with 5-10 m spatial resolution and up to 200-300 m in height (over the maximum building heights in the I km grid cell). The MICROSYS model is ran in diagnostic mode and uses the boundary and initial conditions from MM5-CMAQ-EMIMO. The system MM5-CMAQ-EMIMO-MICROSYS produces reliable air quality forecasts for urban areas with street level detail over the Internet. In this contribution we will show the special example applied to Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain). Additionally, the MM5-CMAQ-EMIMO has been used to find the air quality impact of several industrial plants such as combined cycle power and cement plants. The system uses sophisticated cluster technology to take advantage of distributed and shared memory machines in order to perform the parallel runs in an efficient and optimal way since the process should operate on a daily basis.

To that end, 216 models based on neural networks (NN) have been built. Spatial variability for the five pollutants has been assessed using Principal Components Analysis and different behaviour has been detected for the nonreactive pollutant (SO2) and the rest (CO, NO2, NO and O-3). This can be explained by the very local effects involved in the photochemical reactions. The inputs used to feed the NN models intended to predict forthcoming levels of these five pollutants, include a baseline based on autocorrelation plus a linear or nonlinear combination of different meteorological and traffic variables. The nature of these combinations is different depending on the sensor thus showing the importance of the spatial variability to build the models. The number of hourly cases, due to gaps in data predictions, can have a possible range from 11% to 38% depending on the sensor. Depending on the pollutant, location and number of hours ahead the prediction is made, different types of models have been selected. The use of these models based on NNs can provide Bilbao's air pollution network originally designed for diagnosis purposes, with short-term, real time forecasting capabilities. The performance of these models at the different sensors in the area range from a maximum value of R-2=0.88 for the prediction of NO2 1 hour ahead, to a minimum value of R-2=0.15 for the prediction of ozone 8 hours ahead.

Previous studies indicated potential changes in vectors of climate-related distribution, but impact outcomes need to be further studied. We report climatic and El Nino events during 1985-2002 that may have had an impact on leishmaniasis in 11 southern departments of Colombia: Amazonas, Caqueta, Cauca (Ca), Huila, Meta (Mt), Narino, Putumayo (Py), Tolima, Valle (Va), Vaupes (Vp), and Vichada. Climatic data were obtained by satellite and epidemiologic data were obtained from the Health Ministry. NOAA climatic classification and SOI/ONI indexes were used as indicators of global climate variability. Yearly variation comparisons and median trend deviations were made for disease incidence and climatic variability. During this period there was considerable climatic variability, with a strong El Nino for 6 years and a strong La Nina for 8. During this period, 19,212 cases of leishmaniasis were registered, for a mean of 4756.83 cases/year. Disease in the whole region increased (mean of 4.98%) during the El Nino years in comparison to the La Nina years, but there were differences between departments with increases during El Nino (Mt 6.95%, Vp 4.84%), but the rest showed an increase during La Nina (1.61%-64.41%). Differences were significant in Va (P = 0.0092), Py (P = 0.0001), Ca (P = 0.0313), and for the whole region (P = 0.0023), but not in the rest of the departments. The importance of climate change is shown by shifts in insect and animal distributions. These data reflect the importance of climate on transmission of leishmaniasis and open further investigations related to forecasting and monitoring systems, where understanding the relationship between zoonoses and climate variability could help to improve the management of these emerging and reemerging diseases.",,,,"AJ, Rodriguez-Morales/R-9765-2016; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J./A-6359-2011","AJ, Rodriguez-Morales/0000-0001-9773-2192; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J./0000-0001-9773-2192; Cardenas, Rocio/0000-0001-8916-8544; Sandoval, Claudia/0000-0001-8981-047X",,,,,26,27,0,7,,,,0077-8923,,978-1-57331-714-6,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2008,1149,,,,,,326,330,,10.1196/annals.1428.094,,,,Ecology; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Veterinary Sciences,,,WOS:000262400000081,19120241,,,,

While PVA is a widely sanctioned tool in conservation biology, the field of population viability is in its infancy with respect to species interactions. In this paper, I review available methods for evaluating extinction risk when species interactions contribute significantly to population viability. This review includes an evaluation of six broad categories of species interactions (predation, disease, competition, mutualism, parasitism and host-parasitoid interactions) in population viability analysis, with a particular focus on predation as a case study. I first evaluated how often species interactions are considered when PVA is applied to population data from imperiled species. I identified 378 articles in commonly cited conservation journals, of which 24 attempted a viability analysis for populations threatened by interactions with other species. Most of these PVA's treat a putative species interaction as a constant source of mortality rather than a coupled, dynamic population process. Second, I reviewed the literature to identify the availability of time-series of abundance data for two interacting species in which at least one species was threatened or endangered. Adequate time-series data were available for both species comprising an interacting pair in only 9 out of 407 papers reviewed. Third, I used a stochastic, fully stage-structured predator prey model to create time-series data (vital rates and projection matrices) in order to quantify the efficacy of two matrix-based, single-species PVA approaches. Simple single-species PVAs confound stochastic variation with population cycles induced by species interactions (in this case predation). As a result these models provide conservatively biased forecasts of viability. Unfortunately, the data needed to construct more complex PVA's with feedback and multi-species stochasticity are rarely collected. I close with a discussion of key advances needed to ""escape the population vacuum"" in a move toward more realistic estimates of extinction risk.

Outbreak dynamics have plagued management strategies in the rangeland, and attempts to find simple, linear and mechanistic solutions to both understanding and predicting the dynamics have proved fruitless. These efforts to ground theory in a correspondence with the ""real"" world, including whether the population dynamics are ultimately density dependent or density independent, have generated abundant heat but little light. We suggest that a pragmatic approach, in which theories are taken to be ""tools"" rather than competing claims of truth, has greater promise to move ecological research in a constructive direction. Two recent non-linear approaches exploiting the tools of complexity science provide insights relevant to explaining and forecasting population dynamics. Observation and data collection were used to structure models derived from catastrophe theory and self-organized criticality. These models indicate that nonlinear processes are important in the dynamics of the outbreaks. And the conceptual structures of these approaches provide clear, albeit constrained or contingent, implications for pest managers. We show that, although these two frameworks, catastrophe theory and self-organized criticality, are very different, the frequency distributions of time series from both systems result in power law relationships. Further, we show that a simple lattice-based model, similar to SOC but structured on the biology of the grasshoppers gives a spatial time series similar to data over a 50-year span and the frequency distribution is also a power law relationship. This demonstration exemplifies how a ""both-and"" rather than an ""either-or"" approach to ecological modeling, in which the useful elements of particular theories or conceptual structures are extracted, may provide a way forward in addressing particularly difficult ecological problems.",,,,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0221595]; USDA-ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),DRL was supported by NSF grant DGE-0221595 and the USDA-ARS.

Thus, in a combined elevated CO2 and O-3 atmosphere, seed yield is at least restored to that of charcoal-filtered (CF) air at ambient CO2. The CO2-induced yield increase in CF air is highly variable, suggesting other potential resource limitations. To understand such variability in response, we tested that (1) competition for resources precludes some of the CO2 enhancement on biomass and yield; and (2) O-3 reduces competition in elevated CO2. We grew rice (Oryza sativa L.) at five densities in CF and O-3-fumigated (+O3) air at ambient (A) and elevated [CO2] (+CO2) in 1997 and 1998. O-3 reduced biomass by 25% and seed yield by 13-20% in A, but had little effect in +CO2. A competition model of biomass and yield response to density based on resource availability without competition showed that fewer resources were used for biomass in +O3 than in CF (average 53% vs. 70%) in A, while in +CO2 85% of resources were used for biomass regardless of O-3 suggesting greater depletion of resources. The enhanced biomass response to CO2 with O-3 is consistent with a 22% greater CO2 enhancement ratio [mass in +CO2 air/mass in A air; enhancement ratio (ER)] in +O3 than in CF air. For seed yield, few resources were used (average 17% and 25% for CF in 1997 and 1998, respectively), and ER was 13% greater in +O3. With competition the rate of change of individual plant biomass to density was not affected by +CO2 in CF air in 1997 but was increased 19% with more nutrients in 1998, indicating resource limitations with +CO2. The rate of change of individual plant yield to density was reduced with CO2 in 1997 and unchanged in 1998 showing a different response to resource limitation for reproductive biomass. The resource use in +O3-A suggested that increased density and soil fertility might compensate for pollutant damage. Although ambient [O-3] can modulate the response to elevated CO2, resource limitation precludes the CO2 fertilization impact and both factors need consideration for better management and forecasts of future productivity.",,,,,,,,,,16,23,0,33,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

At the community level, range shifts lead to a turnover of species, i.e. community reassembly. In contrast, phenotypic adaptation allows species to persist in situ, conserving community composition. So far, community reassembly and adaptation have mostly been studied separately. In nature, however, both processes take place simultaneously. In migratory birds, climate change has been shown to result in both exchange of species and adaptation of migratory behaviour. The aim of our study is to predict the impact of global climate change on migratory bird communities and to assess the extent to which reassembly and adaptation may contribute to alterations. Location Europe. Methods We analysed the relationship between current climate and the proportion of migratory species across bird assemblages in Europe. The magnitude of community reassembly was measured using spatial variation in the proportion of potentially migratory species. Adaptation was inferred from spatial variation in the proportion of potentially migratory species that actually migrate at a specific site. These spatial relationships were used to make temporal predictions of changes in migratory species under global climate change. Results According to our models, increasing winter temperature is expected to lead to declines in the proportion of migratory species, whereas increasing spring temperature and decreasing spring precipitation may lead to increases. Changes in winter and spring temperature are expected to cause mainly adaptation in migratory activity, while changes in spring precipitation may result in both changes in the proportion of potentially migratory species and adaptation of migratory activity. Main conclusions Under current climate change forecasts, changes in the proportion of migratory species will be modest and the communities of migratory birds in Europe are projected to be altered through adaptation of migratory activity rather than through exchange of species.",,,,"Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019","Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586; Jetz, Walter/0000-0002-1971-7277",,,,,44,44,3,78,,,,1466-822X,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Here we discuss the major concepts associated with the HR effect and present results of computer simulations focusing on the linkage effects generated by multiple sites under weak selection. Most models of linkage and selection forecast differences in effectiveness of selection between chromosomes or chromosomal regions involving a number of genes. The abundance and physical clustering of weakly selected mutations across genomes, however, justify the investigation of HR effects at a very local level and we pay particular attention to linkage effects among selected sites of the same gene. Overall, HR effects caused by weakly selected mutations predict differences in effectiveness of selection between genes that differ in exon-intron structures and across genes. Under this scenario, introns might play an advantageous role reducing intragenic HR effects. Finally, we summarize observations that are consistent with local HR effects in Drosophila, discuss potential consequences on population genetic studies and suggest future lines of research.",,,,"Comeron, Josep/G-6630-2012",,,,,,105,107,1,30,,,,0018-067X,1365-2540,,HEREDITY,Heredity,JAN,2008,100,1,,,,,19,31,,10.1038/sj.hdy.6801059,,,,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,,,WOS:000251727900006,17878920,,,,

Signs of earlier traditional agricultural practices stretching back centuries may be found in the plant cover and soil characteristics of forest ecosystems. The aim of the study was to find associations between biophysical factors (absolute elevation, geographical location), forests' historical land use (forest continuity types) and present floristic composition on the islands of Saaremaa and Muhu in western Estonia. Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison of mean ranks for all groups, frequency tables with Chi-Square tests and indicator species analysis were used. The Ellenberg values and hemerophoby degrees of the indicator species in forest continuity types were compared. Natural forests are associated with the areas of greatest absolute height and hence, in conditions of post-glacial land uplift, of the greatest age, while afforested former semi-natural plant communities are associated with lower (post-glacially younger) and western areas. Semi-natural woodlands covered mainly with deciduous trees, are relatively well preserved in eastern areas. The sensitive indicators of field layer vascular plant flora are the dwarf shrubs typically found in natural forests. The abundance of species sensitive to human activities (including orchids) is highest in natural forests, but also great in semi-natural woodlands pointing to the high value of these habitats. Knowledge derived from the observed relations between different land use practices and forest vegetation can be used to more precisely determine the conservation value of stands, to forecast the course of their succession, and to choose suitable management methods to support timber production or conservation.

This article explores how the use of genomics-based tools that measure gene expression-DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR - can assist in this effort and reveal aspects of how calcifying marine organisms will respond to ocean acidification. More specifically, what stands to be gained from this approach is an understanding of the direct effects of ocean acidification and whether organisms have sufficient physiological plasticity to adapt to the altered CO2 conditions. We provide a brief overview of biomineralization processes in corals and sea urchin larvae, and then link these pathways to ways in which gene expression analysis can reveal physiological responses and mechanisms, and further, can define new testable hypotheses. In addition, we review the resources available and strategies that might be taken for each of 2 study organisms, stony corals and sea urchins.

The increased CO2 diffuses from the atmosphere into ocean surface waters, resulting in increased partial pressure of CO2, and reduced [CO32-] and pH. The CO2-driven ocean acidification leads to a decrease in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation state in the ocean surface waters and has potential impacts on calcifiers. The present study focuses on the effects of ocean acidification on early developmental and reproductive stages of calcifiers, both of which are believed to be the most vulnerable stages to environmental change within a life cycle. Laboratory experiments revealed that ocean acidification has negative impacts on the fertilization, cleavage, larva, settlement and reproductive stages of several marine calcifiers, including echinoderm, bivalve, coral and crustacean species. There appear to be significant ontogenetic impacts and species-specific differences in tolerance to the high CO2 levels. The conclusion is that future changes in ocean acidity will potentially impact the population size and dynamics, as well as the community structure of calcifiers, and will therefore have negative impacts on marine ecosystems. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential impacts on non-calcifiers, as well as the synergistic impacts of ocean acidification and climate change. Studies should also focus on the adaptive capability of marine organisms, which will be crucial to the ability to forecast how marine organisms and ecosystems will respond to the world's oceans as they warm and acidify.",,,,,,,,,,404,421,9,488,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Our survey of the existing literature on the effects of increased pCO(2) on fish (total of 116 papers) revealed that few studies were conducted under pCO(2) conditions relevant to the future scenarios of ocean acidification. Information is nearly absent on reproduction, early development, and behaviour of marine fish. The short experimental durations of these studies preclude forecasting of how mortality and growth of marine fish would be affected by future increases in seawater CO2, Fish have been shown to maintain their oxygen consumption under elevated pCO(2) conditions, in contrast to declines seen in several marine invertebrates, in spite of possible additional energetic costs incurred by higher pCO(2). Impacts of prolonged CO2 exposure on reproduction, early development, growth, and behaviour of marine fish are important areas that need urgent investigation. There is also a need to rapidly advance research into possible acclimation of marine fish to high pCO(2) environments, endocrine responses to prolonged CO2 exposure, and indirect influences through food availability and quality on fish growth, survival and reproduction.

Several mitigation measures, referred to as 'geoengineering options', have been proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To be successful, such a mitigation operation must remove 'significant' CO2 from the atmosphere for many decades, be verifiable, and not cause deleterious side effects. One option, purposeful addition of iron to fertilize photosynthetic uptake Of CO2 by phytoplankton in regions of the ocean where iron is a limiting nutrient, has received considerable scientific attention. In the last 15 yr, a dozen small-scale open ocean iron fertilization experiments have been performed and a succession of models of large-scale fertilization have been developed. As successive models have become more realistic, the amounts Of CO2 forecast to be sequestered have dropped, and in all cases are small relative to the amounts Of CO2 projected to be released through fossil fuel burning over the next century for any of the IPCC emission scenarios. Possible side effects include a long term reduction in ocean productivity, alteration of the structure of marine food webs, and a more rapid increase in ocean acidity. Most importantly, increased remineralization associated with the increased downward export of organic carbon particles would result: in increased production of the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas, N2O. The magnitude of this effect is poorly known.",,,,,,,,,,31,33,2,66,,,,0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar. Ecol.-Prog.

In this paper, we describe simple non-parametric multivariate procedures derived from a method originally used in climatology to (1) evaluate the breadth of the ecological niche of a species and (2) examine whether the niches are significantly separated. We first applied the statistical procedures to a simple fictive example of 3 species separated by 2 environmental factors in order to describe the technique. We then used it to quantify and compare the ecological niche of 2 key-structural marine zooplankton copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus, in the northern part of the North Atlantic Ocean using 3 environmental factors.

The observed quantities - the pixel absolute temperature and radiative emissivity - are converted to emission fluxes via empirical emission factors. The products are available in near-real time and thus are utilized for the operational evaluation and forecasting of the atmospheric composition over Europe. Both versions of FAS are integrated with the Air Quality and Emergency Modelling System SILAM, which uses the estimated emissions for the atmospheric composition simulations merging them with the anthropogenic and natural emission fluxes. Using the SILAM simulations of selected episodes and MODIS aerosol optical density observations for comparison, the recalibration of the literature-available emission factors has been done.

The experience of Air Quality forecasting with the SILAM modelling system, which considers anthropogenic, natural and fire-related emission sources is discussed. The fire emission is deduced from the near-real-time MODIS satellite retrievals using two sets of products of the instrument, which are assimilated daily by the emission pre-processor. We analysed several episodes and compared the impact of fires with contributions from anthropogenic sources. For example, high concentrations of nearly all pollutants were detected in Central, Eastern and Northern Europe in late spring of 2006. Simulations showed that this episode was formed by contributions of all main sources: major wild-land fires in Russia and substantial amounts of anthropogenic and natural air pollutants were accumulated for a few days over Eastern Europe. A synchronization role was played by meteorology. Specific weather conditions promoted formation of the multi-component pollution cloud, which was then transported across most of Central and Northern Europe causing widespread allergic symptoms and other illnesses associated with poor air quality. Several other episodes were more localised. Thus, August of 2006 was particularly difficult in Portugal and Spain, but also in Finland, while August 2007 was particularly difficult in Greece. The model predictions were compared with available information from ground-based monitoring sites and the satellite retrievals.

We examine how periphyton and benthic invertebrate assemblages vary across regulated and unregulated sections of the Elwha River and across different habitat types, and establish baseline data for tracking future changes following dam removal. We collected multiple years of data on physical habitat, water chemistry, periphyton, and benthic invertebrates from 52 sites on the Elwha River and a reference section on the Quinault River, a neighboring basin. We found that substrate in regulated river sections was coarser and less heterogeneous in size than in unregulated sections, and summer water temperature and specific conductivity higher. Periphyton biomass was also consistently higher in regulated than unregulated sections. Benthic invertebrate assemblage structure at sites above both dams was distinct from sites between and below the dams, due in large part to dominance of mayfly taxa compared to higher relative abundance of midges and non-insect taxa at downstream sites. Following dam removal, we anticipate that both periphyton and benthic invertebrate abundance and diversity will temporarily decrease between and below dams as a result of sediment released from behind the reservoirs. Over the long-term, increased floodplain heterogeneity and recolonization by anadromous fish will alter benthic invertebrate and periphyton assemblages via increases in niche diversity and inputs of marine-derived nutrients.

They include natural and man-induced catastrophes, international terrorism, ecological imbalance, global climate change and many other hazards. According to UN and scientific forecasts, an increasing tendency for the catastrophe scale will retain in XXI century. The humankind has faced the majority of the above issues for the first time and, therefore, there are no good suitable methods provided for their solving. A purposeful activity of all states of the world community is required. This paper presents an international Program with the participation of six countries: Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Program includes separate Projects, developed by each participating country and is briefly described in the present paper. Today, one of the possible methods to analyse the problem is the assessment of risks and the possible ecological and economic damages resulting from catastrophes. We will pay attention to the most ecological dangerous regions and single out typical factors that significantly increase the risk of natural and man-induced catastrophes. The prediction, prevention and assessment of the above mentioned treats are especially actual and important for new independent states, where the system of safety, boundary and customs control, that of strict visa control and other state safety measures have not yet been formed. Also it is easier to implement risks associated with terrorist attacks in these regions. Their consequences will be followed by major human and huge material losses, and extremely negative irreversible environmental effects of global scale.

Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species' range shifts, changes in phenology and species' extinctions, accurate projections of species' responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species' responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species' distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the ""trailing edge"" of shifting populations, species' interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes A occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species' distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species' migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species' distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

It is surprising then that this area of research has not grown in prominence with respect to other approaches employed in modelling plant systems. In this review, we provide an analysis of the development and role of modelling in the field of plant population biology through an exploration of where it has been, where it is now and, in our opinion, where it should be headed. We focus, in particular, on the role plant population modelling could play in ecological forecasting, an urgent need given current rates of regional and global environmental change. We suggest that a critical element limiting the current application of plant population modelling in environmental research is the trade-off between the necessary resolution and detail required to accurately characterize ecological dynamics pitted against the goal of generality, particularly at broad spatial scales. In addition to suggestions how to overcome the current shortcoming of data on the process-level we discuss two emerging strategies that may offer a way to overcome the described limitation: (1) application of a modern approach to spatial scaling from local processes to broader levels of interaction and (2) plant functional-type modelling. Finally we outline what we believe to be needed in developing these approaches towards a 'science of forecasting'. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

The initial mail survey was undertaken in 2000-01 (n=43) and provided a useful benchmark of pastoralists climate knowledge. Two years of climate applications activities were completed and clients were re-surveyed in 2003 (n=49) to measure the change in knowledge and assess the effectiveness of the climate applications activities. Two methods were used to assess changes in client knowledge, viz., self-assessment and test questions. We found that the use of seasonal climate forecasts in decision making increased from 36% in 2001 (n=42) to 51% in 2003 (n=49) (P=0.07). The self-assessment technique was unsatisfactory as a measure of changing knowledge over short periods (1-3 years), but the test question technique was successful and indicated an improvement in climate knowledge among respondents. The increased levels of use of seasonal climate forecasts in management and improved knowledge was partly attributed to the climate applications activities of the project. Further, those who used seasonal forecasting (n=25) didn't understand key components of forecasts ( e. g. probability, median) better than those who didn't use seasonal forecasts (n=24) (P>0.05). This identifies the potential for misunderstanding and misinterpretation of forecasts among users and highlights the need for providers of forecasts to understand the difficulties and prepare simply written descriptions of forecasts and disseminate these with the maps showing probabilities. The most preferred means of accessing climate information were internet, email, 'The Season Ahead' newsletter and newspaper. The least preferred were direct contact with extension officers and attending field days and group meetings. Eighty-six percent of respondents used the internet and 67% used ADSL broadband internet (April 2003). Despite these findings, extension officers play a key role in preparing and publishing the information on the web, in emails and newsletters. We also believe that direct contact with extension officers trained in climate applications is desirable in workshop-like events to improve knowledge of the difficult concepts underpinning climate forecasts, which may then stimulate further adoption.",,,,,,The Natural Heritage Trust; Land Water and Wool Climate,We gratefully acknowledge the pastoralists who participated in the survey.

The existing policy of a 20% annual removal rate as long as the forecast abundance exceeds the fishing threshold (25% of estimated unfished equilibrium spawning biomass) was determined to be precautionary, given the performance indicators, for all but the Queen Charlotte Islands stock.

The first step is to construct whole-ecosystem models of present and selected past times. This process uses scientific, archeological, traditional, and local environmental knowledge in a way that encourages the support from coastal communities. Next, fisheries are chosen to meet sustainability and other criteria-termed ""Lost Valley' Fisheries-which are assessed for their impacts on biomass, biodiversity, and risk of local extinctions, and their benefits in producing jobs and profit. Optimum restorable biomass (ORB) offers a new ecosystem-based policy goal for the restoration of Fisheries. Viability analysis, including risks from climate variability, shows the results of different trade-offs between benefits and costs. The third step is to evaluate the total benefits and costs that might derive from each alternative ecosystem, along with the costs of achieving each restoration and the emplacement of sustainable fisheries. Finally, the ecosystem that maximizes benefits over costs is an optimal policy goal that embodies ecological, economic, and social criteria, and, within the limits of uncertainty and knowledge of critical ecosystem processes, provides for sustainable Fisheries in a restored future. Some restoration trajectories forecast by the model may offer direct economic benefits. Experience with this system so far suggests that, while all fisheries affect biodiversity, acceptable options include only small amounts of weighting on economic or social goals. And although some quantitative details remain to be solved, Back to the Future represents a coherent, viable set of ecosystem-based tools and policy goals that may allow for sustainable fisheries and restored ecosystems while avoiding the depletions that have dogged the past. Preliminary results with a few case studies suggest that trade-offs may offer win-win solutions, offering the exciting possibility of a genuine reconciliation of fisheries with conservation.",,,,"Ainsworth, Cameron/E-8507-2011",,,,,,3,3,0,3,,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-80-3,AM FISH S S,Am.

Allelochemicals have been found in many forest ecosystems, but the importance of allelopathy depends on forest type and environmental conditions. Despite the wide presence of this phenomenon, few forest models have incorporated a representation of allelopathy, but its inclusion should be considered in forest models dealing with environmental stress, exotic plant invasions and ecological succession. Multiple factors influence allelochemical production and toxicity, including nutrient availability, soil moisture and texture, solar radiation, and temperature. Ecosystem-level effects of allelopathy include changes in germination rates, inhibition of seedling growth, mycorrhizal function, insect and bacterial growth, inhibition of nitrification or litterfall decomposition and dieback of mature trees. To illustrate some potential consequences of incorporation some aspects of allelopathy, in an ecosystem-level model, a virtual experiment was carried out with the forest ecosystem-level model FORECAST. This revealed different effects of allelopathy on several ecological variables depending on the type of allelopathic influence simulated. In addition, this experiment showed the utility of ecosystem-level models to simulate, if not directly the allelopathic interactions, at least the ecological effects of allelopathy at the ecosystem level. Overall, my work points out that researchers and forest managers should think carefully about the need to include allelopathy as a way of improving the accuracy of forest models and ecosystem-based decision support tools.

This is mainly due to the ENSO (El Nino-Southern oscillation)-caused changes in the population dynamics of the stock, which greatly proliferated during the El Nino events 1983 and 1998. As a consequence ""gold rush"" conditions arose and resource users profited from a multi-million dollar export business. After the El Nino booms, the system normalized and catches dropped to normal levels. This boom and bust situation has made a rational management of the resource difficult, and annual catches are considered unpredictable, just like the stochastic environment. This paper attempts to provide a catch forecast model to enable the scallop fishery to better prepare for and adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the scallop stock. The model proposes that annual catches are mainly the result of the recruitment success of the incoming new cohort, which is a function of adult spawning stock size and the number of settlers to the sea bottom. The latter is considered a function of the larval mortality rate and the temperature-dependent development time to the settlement stage, while the former is proportional to the catches taken over the spawning period (November-April). Using monthly catch and temperature data for the period 1983-2005, we constructed a regression model to predict the catch for the year after the recruitment period (July-June) as a function of (a) the catch during the spawning period (as a proxy for spawning stock biomass) and (b) the settlement factor that was derived from the mean water temperature over the spawning period, an assumed instantaneous larval mortality rate, and the relationship between temperature and larval period to settlement. The resulting multiple regression (R-2 = 0.930) proves that both factors can explain a large part of the inherent variability of the data. The model reveals that annual catches greatly depend on the spawning stock size when temperatures are low, while this factor decreases in importance with increasing temperatures, at which the settlement factor is much more influential instead. These findings are relevant for the stock management: at low temperatures, the maintenance of a large enough spawning stock over the spawning period (November-April) is decisive for the yield of the post-recruitment fishing period thereafter, while at increasing spawning temperatures, spawning stock size is of decreasing importance for determining the yield.

The developed watershed runoff model and reservoir water quality model with meteorological input calculated by a GCM A2 scenario is applied to Shimajigawa reservoir located in western Japan. To evaluate the sensitivity and long-term effects of climate change on water quality and aquatic ecosystems, we compare the simulated results of the lake model obtained for 1991-2001 with those obtained for 2091-2100. The 10-year average of surface water temperature in the 2090s was predicted to increase by about 3.4 degrees C compared with in the 1990s. The surface water temperature is expected to increase by 3.8 degrees C and the water temperature of the hypolimnion by 2.8 degrees C. As a result, higher temperatures expected to expand the thermal stratification period, and deepen the thermocline. This change might also lead to an increase in oxygen demand for aerobic decomposition, and promote an upward flux of phosphorus from sediments, increasing the concentration and amount of phosphorus in the hypolimnion. In Shimajigawa reservoir, phosphate release from sediments under anaerobic conditions is spread to AAE layer by the vertical diffusion and is transported to the epilimnion by the turnover, causing phytoplankton growth in the epilimnion. Based on long-term prediction using water quality model global warming were shown to cause more trophic lake conditions, further promoting algal growth and changing the aquatic ecosystems.

Current mathematical methods for epidemiological forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact patterns may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or sexual relationships. Here, we develop a mathematical approach to predicting disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a characteristic behaviour (typical contact number), but the identities of their contacts change in time. We show that dynamic contact patterns shape epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter, thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models.

Literature shows that nitrogen leaching on a dairy farm varies greatly with forage systems, amount of manure N applied, seasonal rainfall amounts, and soil characteristics. The purpose of this study was to devise dairy-specific strategies for forage crops and manure effluent application rates conditioned to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon that determines El Nino, La Nina, or neutral years, each of which is associated with temperature and rainfall patterns, to reduce N leaching on a typical North Florida dairy farm. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate N leaching and biomass accumulation using 43 years of daily weather data and eleven forage systems supplied with four levels of manure N (20-160 kg N ha(-1) mo(-1)), and ten soil types where dairies are found. Higher N leaching and lower biomass accumulation occurred in El Nino years than in neutral and La Nina years. N leaching in all ENSO phases was high in winter, particularly in January and February compared to other times in a year. Overall, forage systems with the best potential to limit N leaching were: in the spring (March-May) those that combine bahiagrass or bermudagrass in El Nino years and corn in neutral and La Nina years; in the summer (June-August) those with bahiagrass or bermudagrass in El Nino, bahiagrass, bermudagrass, or corn in neutral, and corn in La Nina years; and in the winter (December-March) those with intercropping of ryegrass, rye, oats, and wheat. This study demonstrates that recommendations for least N leaching can be developed using ENSO phase forecasts.

The lack of such research may stem from the common assumption that native and introduced species exhibit similar environmental tolerances. Here we combine experimental and spatial modeling approaches (1) to determine the relative importance of biotic and abiotic controls of Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) invasion success, (2) to examine how the importance of these factors changes with spatial scale in southern California (USA), and (3) to assess how Argentine ants differ from native ants in their environmental tolerances. A factorial field experiment that combined native ant removal with irrigation revealed that Argentine ants failed to invade any dry plots (even those lacking native ants) but readily invaded all moist plots. Native ants slowed the spread of Argentine ants into irrigated plots but did not prevent invasion. In areas without Argentine ants, native ant species showed variable responses to irrigation. At the landscape scale, Argentine ant occurrence was positively correlated with minimum winter temperature (but not precipitation), whereas native ant diversity increased with precipitation and was negatively correlated with minimum winter temperature. These results are of interest for several reasons. First, they demonstrate that fine-scale differences in the physical environment can eclipse biotic resistance from native competitors in determining community susceptibility to invasion. Second, our results illustrate surprising complexities with respect to how the abiotic factors limiting invasion can change with spatial scale, and third, how native and invasive species can differ in their responses to the physical environment. Idiosyncratic and scale-dependent processes complicate attempts to forecast where introduced species will occur and how their range limits may shift as a result of climate change.",,,,,"Jetz, Walter/0000-0002-1971-7277",,,,,61,62,1,39,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2007,88,12,,,,,3164,3173,,10.1890/07-0122.1,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000251965200021,18229850,,,,

In this paper, we argue that accurate forecasting of a population's quasi-extinction risk does not necessarily require knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms. Because of the stochastic and multiplicative nature of population growth, the ensemble behaviour of population trajectories converges to common statistical forms across a wide variety of stochastic population processes. This paper provides a theoretical basis for this argument. We show that the quasi-extinction surfaces of a variety of complex stochastic population processes (including age-structured, density-dependent and spatially structured populations) can be modelled by a simple stochastic approximation: the stochastic exponential growth process overlaid with Gaussian errors. Using simulated and real data, we show that this model can be estimated with 20-30 years of data and can provide relatively unbiased quasi-extinction risk with confidence intervals considerably smaller than (0,1). This was found to be true even for simulated data derived from some of the noisiest population processes (density-dependent feedback, species interactions and strong age-structure cycling). A key advantage of statistical models is that their parameters and the uncertainty of those parameters can be estimated from time series data using standard statistical methods. In contrast for most species of conservation concern, biologically realistic models must often be specified rather than estimated because of the limited data available for all the various parameters. Biologically realistic models will always have a prominent place in PVA for evaluating specific management options which affect a single segment of a population, a single demographic rate, or different geographic areas. However, for forecasting quasi-extinction risk, statistical models that are based on the convergent statistical properties of population processes offer many advantages over biologically realistic models.",,,,"Sabo, John/B-1872-2013",,,,,,60,60,0,51,,,,1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Location Intertidal marshes along the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts of North America. Methods amova, parsimony analysis, haplotype networks of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences, neighbour-joining analysis, Bayesian analysis of population structure, and individual assignment testing were used. Results Low levels of gene flow and geographic patterns of genetic variation were found among native S. alterniflora from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. The distribution of cpDNA haplotypes indicates that Atlantic coast S. alterniflora are subdivided into 'northern' and 'southern' groups. Variation observed at microsatellite loci further suggests that mid-Atlantic S. alterniflora are differentiated from S. alterniflora found in southern Atlantic and New England coastal marshes. Comparisons between native populations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and non-native Pacific coast populations substantiate prior studies demonstrating reciprocal interspecific hybridization in San Francisco Bay. Our results corroborate historical evidence that S. alterniflora was introduced into Willapa Bay from multiple source populations. However, we found that some Willapa Bay S. alterniflora are genetically divergent from putative sources, probably as a result of admixture following secondary contact among previously allopatric native populations. We further recovered evidence in support of models suggesting that S. alterniflora has secondarily spread within Washington State, from Willapa Bay to Grays Harbor. Main conclusions Underlying genetic structure has often been cited as a factor contributing to ecological variation of native S. alterniflora. Patterns of genetic structure within native S. alterniflora may be the result of environmental differences among biogeographical provinces, of migration barriers, or of responses to historical conditions. Interactions among these factors, rather than one single factor, may best explain the distribution of genetic variation among native S. alterniflora. Comprehensive genetic comparisons of native and introduced populations can illustrate how biological invasions may result from dramatically different underlying factors - some of which might otherwise go unrecognized. Demonstrating that invasions can result from several independent or interacting mechanisms is important for improving risk assessment and future forecasting. Further research on S. alterniflora not only may clarify what forces structure native populations, but also may improve the management of nonnative populations by enabling post-introduction genetic changes and the rapid evolution of life-history traits to be more successfully exploited.",,,,,,,,,,56,60,4,71,,,,0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

A major challenge arises in characterising these processes, both at the detailed mechanistic level and at an appropriate level for inclusion within catchment-scale models for nutrient management. The lowland catchment research (LOCAR) programme in the UK has provided a unique set of comprehensively instrumented groundwater-dominated catchments. Of these, the Pang and Lambourn, tributaries of the Thames near Reading, have been a particular focus for research into subsurface processes and surface water-groundwater interactions. Data from LOCAR and other sources, along with a new dual permeability numerical model of the Chalk, have been used to explore the relative roles of matrix and fracture flow within the unsaturated zone and resolve conflicting hypotheses of response. From the improved understanding gained through these explorations, a parsimonious conceptualisation of the general response of flow and transport within the Chalk unsaturated zone was formulated. This paper summarises the modelling and data findings of these explorations, and describes the integration of the new simplified unsaturated zone representation with a catchment-scale model of nutrients (INCA), resulting in a new model for catchment-scale flow and transport within Chalk systems: INCA-Chalk. This model is applied to the Lambourn, and results, including hindcast and forecast simulations, are presented. These clearly illustrate the decadal time-scales that need to be considered in the context of nutrient management and the EU Water Framework Directive. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed framework aims to combine the advantageous features of both mechanistic and statistical approaches. Models that are based on mechanistic understanding yet remain within the bounds of data-based parameter estimation can accommodate rigorous and complete error analysis. The incorporation of mechanism improves the confidence in predictions made for a variety of conditions, while the statistical methods provide an empirical basis for parameter estimation and allow for estimates of predictive uncertainty. Our illustration focuses on eutrophication modeling but the proposed methodological framework can be easily transferred to a wide variety of disciplines (e.g., hydrology, ecotoxicology, air pollution). We examine the advantages of the Bayesian calibration using a four state variable (phosphate-detritus-phytoplankton-zooplankton) model and the mesotrophic Lake Washington (Washington State, USA) as a case study. Prior parameter distributions were formed on the basis of literature information, while Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations provided a convenient means for approximating the posterior parameter distributions. The model reproduces the key epilimnetic temporal patterns of the system and provides realistic estimates of predictive uncertainty for water quality variables of environmental interest. Finally, we highlight the benefits of Bayesian parameter estimation, such as the quantification of uncertainty in model predictions, optimization of the sampling design of monitoring programs using value of information concepts from decision theory, alignment with the policy practice of adaptive management, and expression of model outputs as probability distributions, that are perfectly suited for stakeholders and policy makers when making decisions for sustainable environmental management.

Our understanding of how these effects influence community production comes almost entirely from studies of plants. To test whether previous results apply to higher trophic levels, we first used simulations to derive expected contributions of selection and complementarity to production in competitive assemblages defined by either neutral interactions, dominance, or a trade-off between growth and competitive ability. The three types of simulated assemblages exhibited distinct interaction signatures when diversity effects were partitioned into selection and complementarity components. We then compared these signatures to those of experimental marine communities. Diversity influenced production in fundamentally different ways in assemblages of macroalgae, characterized by growth competition trade-offs, vs. in herbivores, characterized by dominance.

Consequently, the conflict between rapid urban sprawl and the maintenance of water bodies in such areas urgently needs to be addressed. An integrated GIS-based analysis system (IGAS) for supporting land-use management of lake areas in urban fringes was developed in this paper. The IGAS consists of modules of land-use suitability assessment and change/demand analysis, and land evaluation and allocation. Multicriteria analysis and system dynamics techniques are used to assess land-use suitability and forecast potential land-use variation, respectively. Cost approximation and hypothetical development methods are used to evaluate land resource and market values, respectively. A case study implementing the system was performed on the Hanyang Lake area in the urban fringe of Wuhan City, central China, which is under significant urbanization pressure. Five categories of suitability were investigated by analyzing 11 criteria and related GIS data. Two scenarios for potential land-use changes from 2006 to 2020 were predicted, based on a systematic analysis and system dynamics modeling, and a hierarchical land-use structure was designed for the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. The IGAS may help local authorities better understand and address the complex land-use system, and develop improved land-use management strategies that better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation.

Nowhere is this change more evident than in the advent of sensor networks able to collect and process (in real time) simultaneous measurements over broad areas and at high sampling rates. At the same time there has been great progress in the development of standards, methods, and tools for data analysis and synthesis, including a new standard for descriptive metadata for ecological datasets (Ecological Metadata Language) and new workflow tools that help scientists to assemble datasets and to diagram, record, and execute analyses. However these developments (important as they are) are not yet sufficient to guarantee the reliability of datasets created by a scientific process - the complex activity that scientists carry out in order to create a dataset. We define a dataset to be reliable when the scientific process used to create it is (1) reproducible and (2) analyzable for potential defects. To address this problem we propose the use of an analytic web, a formal representation of a scientific process that consists of three coordinated graphs (a data-flow graph, a dataset-derivation graph, and a process-derivation graph) originally developed for use in software engineering. An analytic web meets the two key requirements for ensuring dataset reliability: (1) a complete audit trail of all artifacts (e.g., datasets, code, models) used or created in the execution of the scientific process that created the dataset, and (2) detailed process metadata that precisely describe all sub-processes of the scientific process. Construction of such metadata requires the semantic features of a high-level process definition language. In this paper we illustrate the use of an analytic web to represent the scientific process of constructing estimates of ecosystem water flux from data gathered by a complex, real-time multi-sensor network. We use Little-JIL, a high-level process definition language, to precisely and accurately capture the analytical processes involved. We believe that incorporation of this approach into existing tools and evolving metadata specifications (such as EML) will yield significant benefits to science. These benefits include: complete and accurate representations of scientific processes; support for rigorous evaluation of such processes for logical and statistical errors and for propagation of measurement error; and assurance of dataset reliability for developing sound models and forecasts of environmental change.

In streams, species effects on resources and community structure may change as physical characteristics of the stream environment change along drainage networks. We examined spatial and seasonal effects of armored grazers using a small-scale exclusion experiment that was replicated in streams of different drainage areas. Effects of grazing varied with stream size and were related to variation in grazer abundance and phenology. We identified three distinct grazing regimes and a stream size ( drainage area [DA]) threshold corresponding to a shift from one to two functional trophic levels. In streams with DA < 1 km(2), armored grazers did not reduce biomass of algal biofilms. In slightly larger streams (2-3 km(2) DA), the armored grazer guild was dominated by bivoltine Glossosoma. These caddisflies persisted and limited algal biofilms throughout the summer in one of these streams. In the largest tributaries (DA > 10 km(2)), the grazer guild was dominated by univoltine caddisflies, and grazing limited algal biofilms in early summer, but not late summer, after caddisflies pupated.

An ecological model was developed using genetic programming (GP) to predict the time-series dynamics of the diatom, Stephanodiscus hantzschii for the lower Nakdong River, South Korea. Eight years of weekly data showed the river to be hypertrophic (chl. a, 45.1 +/- 4.19 mu g L-1, mean +/- SE, n = 427), and S. hantzschii annually formed blooms during the winter to spring flow period (late November to March). 2. A simple non-linear equation was created to produce a 3-day sequential forecast of the species biovolume, by means of time series optimization genetic programming (TSOGP). Training data were used in conjunction with a GP algorithm utilizing 7 years of limnological variables (1995-2001). The model was validated by comparing its output with measurements for a specific year with severe blooms (1994). The model accurately predicted timing of the blooms although it slightly underestimated biovolume (training r(2) = 0.70, test r(2) = 0.78). The model consisted of the following variables: dam discharge and storage, water temperature, Secchi transparency, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, evaporation and silica concentration. 3. The application of a five-way cross-validation test suggested that GP was capable of developing models whose input variables were similar, although the data are randomly used for training. The similarity of input variable selection was approximately 51% between the best model and the top 20 candidate models out of 150 in total (based on both Root Mean Squared Error and the determination coefficients for the test data). 4. Genetic programming was able to determine the ecological importance of different environmental variables affecting the diatoms. A series of sensitivity analyses showed that water temperature was the most sensitive parameter. In addition, the optimal equation was sensitive to DO, Secchi transparency, dam discharge and silica concentration. The analyses thus identified likely causes of the proliferation of diatoms in 'river-reservoir hybrids' (i.e. rivers which have the characteristics of a reservoir during the dry season). This result provides specific information about the bloom of S. hantzschii in river systems, as well as the applicability of inductive methods, such as evolutionary computation to river-reservoir hybrid systems.",,,,"Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/O-6355-2014","Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/0000-0001-7721-4937",,,,,32,43,0,10,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

A Bayesian approach with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique was used to calibrate the model to different lengths of observed data (4-29 years) and to estimate the prediction uncertainty each calibration. The results show that the difference between modelled and observed water chemistry (calibration goodness of fit) in general decreases with increasing length of the time series used in calibration. However, there are considerable differences for different time series of the same length. The results also show that the uncertainties in predicted future acid neutralizing capacity were lowest (i.e. the distribution peak narrowest) when using the longest time series for calibration.

The answer is that they don't, mostly - they come from different scientific traditions and are not used in the same contexts. Yet they often deal with the same issues. We believe that much can be gained by bringing the two systems of thinking together. This paper is a first attempt to do so, by making qualitative comparisons between different scenarios and highlighting benefits and limitations to each of them. Why are the pictures we get of the energy future so different if we use a macroeconomic model from when using a backcasting approach based on sustainable energy use? It is evident that the methods for producing those two kinds of scenarios differ a lot, but the main reason behind the different results are found in the starting points rather than in the methods. Baseline assumptions are quite different, as well as the interpretations and importance attached to signals about the future. in this paper, it is discussed how those two types of scenarios differ and how they approach issues such as energy prices and growth. The discussion is based on a comparison between Swedish economic and sustainability scenarios. The economic scenarios aim at being forecasts of the future and are used as decision support for long-term policies. But are the assumptions in the economic scenarios reasonable? The sustainability scenarios are explicitly normative backcasting scenarios. They do not take the issue of growth and consumption fully into account. Could they be developed in this respect? The comparison between the scenarios is also used to look closer at the issue of energy prices in a society with sustainable energy use. One of the questions raised is if a low energy society calls for high energy prices. Moreover, the effects of tradable permits versus energy taxes is analysed in the context of how energy use could be kept low in a growing economy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The fields of ecology, biogeography, and evolutionary biology take disparate approaches in addressing spatial variation in reproduction, and thus we lack clear predictions for how reproductive output should vary geographically. We empirically investigate these contrasting theoretical approaches by determining geographic patterns in reproductive output for intertidal populations of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, at 15 sites spanning a large geographic distance (9 degrees span of latitude) from central California, USA, to Baja California, Mexico. Contrary to predictions from biogeography, some of the highest values of reproductive output are at sites near the species' southern range boundary. Additionally, sea urchins do not exhibit a latitudinal gradient in reproduction, but rather show considerable mesoscale variation in reproductive output. Spatial analyses reveal that this variation is correlated with coastal topographic features that are known to influence the pattern of nearshore nutrient flux and circulation. We hypothesize that urchins' reproductive output may be driven by the spatial distribution of their food supply, drift macroalgae, the abundance of which is influenced by both nutrient supply and alongshore transport processes that are coupled to topographic features. Large-scale studies such as this provide valuable insight into the causes of species' range limits, population connectivity, habitat reserve design, and forecasting the effects of climate change on species' distributions.",,,,"Gaines, Steven/Y-3234-2019","Kinlan, Brian/0000-0001-7736-1726",,,,,63,63,3,44,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2007,88,9,,,,,2229,2239,,10.1890/06-1784.1,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000249500900009,17918401,,,,

In this introduction to the special feature, ""Cross-scale interactions and pattern-process relationships"", we provide a synthetic framework for understanding the causes and consequences of cross-scale interactions.

Discharge patterns of streams and rivers may be substantially affected by changes in water management, land use, or climate. Such hydrological alterations are likely to influence biotic processes, including overall ecosystem metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration). One regulator of aquatic ecosystem metabolism directly tied to hydrology is movement of bed sediments. 2. We propose that ecosystem metabolism can be reconstructed or predicted for any suite of hydrological conditions through the use of quantitative relationships between discharge, bed movement and metabolism. We tested this concept on a plains reach of the South Platte River in Colorado. 3. Movement of bed sediments was predicted from river discharge and the Shields stress, a ratio of velocity-induced stress to sediment grain size. Quantitative relationships were established empirically between metabolic response to bed movement and recovery from bed movement, thus linking metabolism to hydrology. 4. The linkage of metabolism to hydrology allowed us to reconstruct daily photosynthesis and respiration over the 70-year period for which discharge is known at our study site on the South Platte River. The reconstruction shows major ecological change caused by hydrological manipulation: the river has lost two-thirds of its photosynthetic potential, and the ratio of photosynthesis to respiration is now much lower than it was prior to 1960. 5. The same approach could be used to anticipate ecological responses to proposed hydrological manipulations, to quantify benefits of hydrological restoration, or to illustrate potential effects of change in climate or land use on flowing-water ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,16,16,0,18,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Climatic influences on this species' life history are considered a major factor in restricting the extent and intensity of outbreaks. We examine the life history traits of the spruce budworm and related Choristoneura populations with respect to forecasting the conifer-feeding responses of these insects in changing environments. Analysis of the evolutionary relationships between Choristoneura entities, including their hybridization, genetic distances, and their degree of sympatry leads us to distinguish 15 possible Choristoneura 'biotypes'. Population trend has been associated with recruitment to the feeding stage, and two indicators of recruitment, egg weights and phenological development, are both 'biotype' and climate dependent. Among Abietoid feeding 'biotypes' and among spruce budworm populations, those from locations with extreme winters tend to have heavier eggs than those from the more benign environments. In spruce budworm, this genetically based adaptation allows populations to increase their potential recruitment substantially where winters are mild. All biotypes feed on the newly developed shoots of their host trees in spring, and are thus vulnerable to the uncertain timing of budbreak. Genetic control of spring emergence is weak so larvae from a single family typically exit from hibernacula over a prolonged period. This guarantees some synchronization with budburst. However, hybrid populations have high heritabilities. This allows rapid adaptation to new conditions (e.g. mixed host-species stands). Geographic variation in phenological development after establishing feeding sites is largely genetically controlled. The importance of variation in these traits is examined with respect to competing population dynamics theories to evaluate their utility in forecasting future trends in defoliation. We finish with a plea for jointly using alternative approaches in forecasting spatiotemporal patterns of defoliation.",,,,,,,,,,44,48,0,30,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Forecasting migration intensity can improve flight safety and reduce the operational costs of collisions between aircraft and migrating birds. This is particularly true for military training flights, which can be rescheduled if necessary and often take place at low altitudes and during the night. Migration intensity depends strongly on weather conditions but reported effects of weather differ among studies. It is therefore unclear to what extent existing predictive models can be extrapolated to new situations. 2. We used radar measurements of bird densities in the Netherlands to analyse the relationship between weather and nocturnal migration. Using our data, we tested the performance of three regression models that have been developed for other locations in Europe. We developed and validated new models for different combinations of years to test whether regression models can be used to predict migration intensity in independent years. Model performance was assessed by comparing model predictions against benchmark predictions based on measured migration intensity of the previous night and predictions based on a 6-year average trend. We also investigated the effect of the size of the calibration data set on model robustness. 3. All models performed better than the benchmarks, but the mismatch between measurements and predictions was large for existing models. Model performance was best for newly developed regression models. The performance of all models was best at intermediate migration intensities. The performance of our models clearly increased with sample size, up to about 90 nocturnal migration measurements. Significant input variables included seasonal migration trend, wind profit, 24-h trend in barometric pressure and rain. 4. Synthesis and applications. Migration intensities can be forecast with a regression model based on meteorological data. This and other existing models are only valid locally and cannot be extrapolated to new locations. Model development for new locations requires data sets with representative inter- and intraseasonal variability so that cross-validation can be applied effectively. The Royal Netherlands Air Force currently uses the regression model developed in this study to predict migration intensities 3 days ahead. This improves the reliability of migration intensity warnings and allows rescheduling of training flights if needed.",,,,"Shamoun-Baranes, Judy/Q-1311-2019; Shamoun-Baranes, Judy/C-6921-2013; Bouten, Willem/G-4383-2018","Shamoun-Baranes, Judy/0000-0002-1652-7646; Shamoun-Baranes, Judy/0000-0002-1652-7646; Bouten, Willem/0000-0002-5250-8872",,,,,50,52,3,39,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We examine how robust five commonly used PVA models are to violations of this assumption. We develop a stochastic, stage-structured predator-prey model and simulate prey population vital rates and abundance. We then use simulated data to parameterize and estimate risk for three demographic models (static projection matrix, stochastic projection matrix, stochastic vital rate matrix) and two time series models (diffusion approximation [DA], corrupted diffusion approximation [CDA]). Model bias is measured as the absolute deviation between estimated and observed quasi-extinction risk. Our results highlight three generalities about the application of single-species models to multi-species conservation problems. First, our collective model results suggest that most single-species PVA models overestimate extinction risk when species interactions cause periodic variation in abundance. Second, the DA model produces the most (conservatively) biased risk forecasts. Finally, the CDA model is the most robust PVA to population cycles caused by species interactions. CDA models produce virtually unbiased and relatively precise risk estimates even when populations cycle strongly.

Both the fish species and the fisheries are strongly affected by climate variations. These climatic effects and the underlying mechanisms are briefly reviewed. We then use recent regional - scale climate - ocean modelling results to consider how climate change during this century will affect the fish community of the Baltic and fisheries management. Expected climate changes in northern Europe will likely affect both the temperature and salinity of the Baltic, causing it to become warmer and fresher. As an estuarine ecosystem with large horizontal and vertical salinity gradients, biodiversity will be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity which can be expected as a consequence of altered precipitation patterns. Marine-tolerant species will be disadvantaged and their distributions will partially contract from the Baltic Sea; habitats of freshwater species will likely expand. Although some new species can be expected to immigrate because of an expected increase in sea temperature, only a few of these species will be able to successfully colonize the Baltic because of its low salinity. Fishing fleets which presently target marine species (e.g. cod, herring, sprat, plaice, sole) in the Baltic will likely have to relocate to more marine areas or switch to other species which tolerate decreasing salinities. Fishery management thresholds that trigger reductions in fishing quotas or fishery closures to conserve local populations (e.g. cod, salmon) will have to be reassessed as the ecological basis on which existing thresholds have been established changes, and new thresholds will have to be developed for immigrant species. The Baltic situation illustrates some of the uncertainties and complexities associated with forecasting how fish populations, communities and industries dependent on an estuarine ecosystem might respond to future climate change.",,,,"Mollmann, Christian/C-4788-2011; Gislason, Henrik/C-1357-2008; Gislason, Henrik/R-9567-2019; Mollmann, Christian/M-8006-2019","Mollmann, Christian/0000-0001-9161-6342; Gislason, Henrik/0000-0003-0242-3333; MacKenzie, Brian/0000-0002-4798-0363",,,,,110,110,3,87,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Location The study area is France and, at a smaller scale, the Paris Basin. Methods We used a statistical model derived from Huchon and Demolin [1970 Revue Forestiere Francaise (special issue: La lutte biologique en foret), 220-234] to test whether their model, updated with climate change, could explain the observed range expansion. Since Battisti and colleagues have recently shown that climate could affect survival of the PPM through its effect on feeding activity, we also developed a mechanistic model based on larval feeding requirements (night air temperature above 0 degrees C and temperature inside the nest above 9 degrees C on the preceding day). We reconstructed the geographical distribution of feeding activity and we compared the resulting change with the PPM range expansion. Results The statistical model did not successfully predict the observed expansion but the mechanistic model showed considerable change in the feeding activity of the PPM. In the Paris Basin, the PPM border coincided with a zone unfavourable for feeding activity in the period 1992-96. Feeding conditions became more favourable in the period 2001-04, and the PPM succeeded in crossing this zone. Over larger temporal and spatial scales improved feeding conditions in the north-western part of France were forecast by the mechanistic model. Main conclusions (1) The range distribution of the PPM in the Paris Basin is no longer limited by unfavourable feeding conditions. (2) The pattern of range expansion of the PPM is now governed mainly by its dispersal capabilities and host tree distribution. (3) At the country scale, this approach gives an approximate prediction of the potential distribution of the PPM, though the model may not be reliable in mountainous regions.",,,,,"Robinet, Christelle/0000-0002-4933-4656",,,,,59,61,1,33,,,,1466-822X,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Relationships between above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of grasslands and annual precipitation are often weak at the site level, with much of the inter-annual variation in ANPP left unexplained. A potential reason for this is that the distribution of precipitation within a growing season affects productivity in addition to the total amount. 2. We analysed long-term ANPP data for three southern African temperate grasslands (mean annual precipitation ranging from 538 mm to 798 mm) to determine the effects of precipitation event size, number and spacing relative to seasonal totals. 3. Ungrazed, non-manipulated treatments at each site showed contrasting results despite sharing a common, dominant species. At the driest site, a model combining average event size and number of events per growing season provided a substantially better fit to the ANPP data than precipitation amount (seasonal total). At the wettest site, the interval between events was the most important precipitation variable. Precipitation distribution was not important at the intermediate site where amount was the best predictor of ANPP. A limit to the size of precipitation events efficiently utilized for ANPP was evident for the driest site only. 4. At each site, experimental treatments that altered species composition and soil fertility had little effect on precipitation-ANPP relationships. The lack of consistency in the relative importance of the precipitation variables among sites suggests that local, edaphic factors modify precipitation-ANPP relationships. 5. This analysis demonstrates that the distribution and size of precipitation events can affect ANPP independent of precipitation amount. As altered precipitation regimes are forecast by global climate models, the sensitivity of ecosystems to precipitation distribution should be considered when predicting responses to climate change. 6. While mean values of precipitation, and other ecosystem drivers, are typically used to predict function at the level of whole ecosystems, our results show that more complex measures of environmental variability may be required to understand ecosystem function, and to increase the accuracy of predictions of ecosystem responses to global change.",,,,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008","Swemmer, Anthony/0000-0003-1378-7394",,,,,120,136,3,96,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Overland dispersal into inland lakes and reservoirs, however, has occurred at a much slower rate than earlier spread via connected, navigable waterways. We forecasted the potential western spread of zebra mussels by predicting the overland movement of recreational boaters with a production-constrained gravity model. We also predicted the potential abundance of zebra mussels in two western reservoirs by comparing their water chemistry characteristics with those of water bodies with known abundances of zebra mussels. Most boats coming from waters infested with zebra mussels were taken to areas that already had zebra mussels, buta small proportion of such boats did travel west of the 100th meridian. If zebra mussels do establish in western US. water bodies, we predict that population densities could achieve similar levels to those in the Midwestern United States, where zebra mussels have caused considerable economic and ecological impacts. Our analyses suggest that the dispersal of zebra mussels to the western United States is an event of low probability but potentially high impact on native biodiversity and human infrastructure.

The Kalman filter is a procedure that facilitates such integration. Based on a state-space model, we can obtain a likelihood function for the survey data using a Kalman filter, which we may then combine with a likelihood for the demographic data. In this paper, we used this combined approach to analyze the population dynamics of a hunted species, the Greater Snow Goose ( Chen caerulescens atlantica), and to examine the extent to which it can improve previous demographic population models. The state equation of the state-space model was a matrix population model with fecundity and regression parameters relating adult survival and harvest rate estimated in a previous capture-recapture study. The observation equation combined the output from this model with estimates from an annual spring photographic survey of the population. The maximum likelihood estimates of the regression parameters from the combined analysis differed little from the values of the original capture-recapture analysis, though their precision improved. The model output was found to be insensitive to a wide range of coefficient of variation ( CV) in fecundity parameters. We found a close match between the surveyed and smoothed population size estimates generated by the Kalman filter over an 18-year period, and the estimated CV of the survey (0.078-0.150) was quite compatible with its assumed value (similar to 0.10). When we used the updated parameter values to predict future population size, the model underestimated the surveyed population size by 18% over a three-year period. However, this could be explained by a concurrent change in the survey method. We conclude that the Kalman filter is a promising approach to forecast population change because it incorporates survey information in a formal way compared with ad hoc approaches that either neglect this information or require some parameter or model tuning.",,,,,"Besbeas, Panagiotis/0000-0002-1579-4152",,,,,35,35,0,43,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2007,88,6,,,,,1420,1429,,10.1890/06-0953,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000247203100010,17601135,,,,

Red-billed queleas Quelea quelea are major pests of small-grain crops throughout sub-Saharan Africa. When conditions permit, birds breed in vast colonies which are targets for control operations. Queleas are intra-African long-distance migrants whose complex movements vary annually according to variations in rainfall patterns. An ability to forecast where and when colonies could be established will greatly improve the efficiency of control measures. We describe such a forecasting model for the southern African subspecies Q. q. lathamii. 2. The model is based on and provides a partial test of the conjectured rainfall-migration model of Ward (1971), whereby quelea movements are determined by rainfall patterns and grass seed availability. We consider that a threshold quantity of rainfall (shown here to be c. 60 mm) within any 2 weeks at the start of the wet season is necessary to cause annual grass seeds to germinate, forcing queleas to emigrate. Only if rainfall exceeds another threshold (240 mm within a 6-week span and at least 6 weeks elapsed after the 60-mm threshold had been exceeded), allowing production of fresh seed, can queleas return and commence breeding. Birds may breed again in the same season by undertaking further long-distance 'breeding migrations' to areas where sufficient rain had fallen even later. 3. Using only estimates of rainfall derived from satellite data, we describe a simple spatio-temporal model for southern Africa to show at weekly intervals those areas where (a) the wet season has not yet started; (b) the early rains migration threshold has been exceeded; (c) the threshold to permit breeding has been exceeded; and (d) conditions are no longer suitable for new colonies to be established. 4. Synthesis and applications. The model was run for three seasons and performed well compared to an expected null distribution of breeding colonies among quarter-degree grid squares. In 2002/2003 and 2004/2005, but not in 2003/2004, quelea colonies were reported significantly more often in grid squares where the model had predicted breeding to be possible. However, in a more refined analysis of a smaller subset of colonies for which precise dates of their establishment were known, their spatio-temporal distribution matched predictions in 95%, 85% and 99% of grid squares, respectively, over the three breeding seasons. These success rates show that predictions from the model, the first of its kind for any African bird, can aid the planning of quelea control strategies.",,,,"Cheke, Robert/AAF-5017-2020","Cheke, Robert/0000-0002-7437-1934",,,,,12,14,0,6,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We estimated a discrete-choice resource selection function (RSF) based upon 21 choice sets from the forest inventories and nocturnal telemetry locations of radiotagged adult spotted owls occupying 17 home ranges. Nocturnal foraging was strongly associated with forests close to nests and small streams. The combined basal areas of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), and red fir (Abies magnifica) and basal area of hardwoods >= 20 cm diameter at breast height were positively and unimodally correlated to foraging habitat selection by owls, whereas the relative probability of selection decreased with increasing basal area of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Opportunistically collected diurnal data indicated that owls roosted in forest stands that contained greater tree densities than those used for foraging. Topographic position, habitat heterogeneity, tree species composition, and forest density also influenced foraging site selection. Because our results indicated that forests can be too dense as well as too open, the study suggests that judiciously applied silvicultural prescriptions may maintain or improve owl foraging habitat. By linking the RSF with forest-inventory data and forest-growth models specific to the region of our study, forest managers can forecast potential consequences of silvicultural options on spotted owl foraging habitat at the level of individuals or that of a population.",,,,,,,,,,20,21,1,15,,,,0022-541X,1937-2817,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Road density trend analysis is often too coarse and assumes homogeneous landscapes, whereas spatial transition probability analysis captures landscape variability typical of ecoregions. Simple models for projecting road network growth will assist planning agencies and conservation organizations to guide protection efforts. We investigate growth of regular public roads in the State of Maine over a 17-year historical period, and then use the best-selected (AIC) logistic regression model to validate and then project spatial probability of future roads to the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion. Nearly 2000 km of new roads were constructed in settled landscapes in Maine 1986-2003, influencing 37,000 ha of adjacent habitats. The majority (93.5%) of the new roads performed local functions and were short (< 1/3 km in length), characterized as residential roads typical of sprawl.

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop tools that allow decision-makers to understand better intended and unintended effects of agricultural policy measures on biodiversity. Here we demonstrate the potential of such a tool by combining a socio-economic model with the biodiversity model GEPARD to forecast the response of bird and carabid species richness to two scenarios of agricultural subsidies: (1) subsidies based on production levels and prices and (2) direct income support that is independent of production levels. We focussed on farmland of the Lahn-Dill area, Germany, as an example of European regions with low intensity farming. GEPARD predicts faunal richness and is based on multi-scaled resource-selection functions. Under both scenarios the area of predicted losses in species richness of birds and carabids was larger than the area of predicted gains in species richness. However, the area with predicted losses of avian richness was smaller under the direct income support scenario than under the production-based subsidy scenario, whereas the area with predicted losses of carabid species richness was smaller under the production-based subsidy scenario than under the direct income support. Yet locally, richness gains of up to four species were predicted for carabids under both scenarios. We conclude that the sometimes contrasting and heterogeneous responses of birds and carabids at different localities suggest the need for spatially targeted subsidy schemes.

Silvoarable agroforestry (SAF) is the cultivation of trees and arable crops on the same parcel of land. SAF may contribute to modern diversified land use objectives in Europe, such as enhanced biodiversity and productivity, reduced leaching of nitrogen, protection against flooding and erosion, and attractiveness of the landscape. Long-term yield predictions are needed to assess long-term economic profitability of SAF. 2. A model for growth, resource sharing and productivity in agroforestry systems was developed to act as a tool in forecasts of yield, economic optimization of farming enterprises and exploration of policy options for land use in Europe. The model is called Yield-SAFE; from ""YIeld Estimator for Long term Design of Silvoarable AgroForestry in Europe"". The model was developed with as few equations and parameters as possible to allow model parameterization under constrained availability of data from long-term experiments. 3. The model consists of seven state equations expressing the temporal dynamics of: (1) tree biomass; (2) tree leaf area, (3) number of shoots per tree; (4) crop biomass; (5) crop leaf area index; (6) heat sum; and (7) soil water content. The main outputs of the model are the growth dynamics and final yields of trees and crops. Daily inputs are temperature, radiation and precipitation. Planting densities, initial biomasses of tree and crop species, and soil parameters must be specified. 4. A parameterization of Yield-SAFE is generated, using published yield tables for tree growth and output from the comprehensive crop simulation model STICS. Analysis of tree and crop growth data from two poplar agroforestry stands in the United Kingdom demonstrates the validity of the modelling concept and calibration philosophy of Yield-SAFE. A sensitivity analysis is presented to elucidate which biological parameters most influence short and long-term productivity and land equivalent ratio. 5. The conceptual model, elaborated in Yield-SAFE, in combination with the outlined procedure for model calibration, offers a valid tool for exploratory land use studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It has been suggested that fishery-associated mortality is the leading factor causing the decline; however, the sensitivity of leatherbacks to climate variability relative to their population ecology is unknown. We investigated the effects of interannual climate variability, as governed by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), on leatherback nesting ecology. We used equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly data over various time scales derived from both moored buoys and remote satellites as signals of ENSO. We then incorporated these data into a remigration probability model for the largest nesting population of eastern Pacific leatherbacks at Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PNMB), Costa Rica. Our results showed that nesting females of PNMB exhibited a strong sensitivity to ENSO, as reflected in their nesting remigration probabilities. Cool La Nina events corresponded with a higher remigration probability and warm El Nino events corresponded with a lower remigration probability. We suggest that productivity transitions at leatherback foraging areas in the eastern equatorial and south-eastern Pacific in response to El Nino/La Nina events result in variable remigration intervals and thus variable annual egg production. This phenomenon may render the eastern Pacific leatherback population more vulnerable to anthropogenic mortality than other populations. Synthesis and applications. Physical indices of environmental variation can be used to estimate the probability of leatherbacks remigrating to nest at PNMB. This type of modelling approach can be extremely useful for understanding the effects of climatic variation on the population dynamics of sea turtles. Our remigration probability model can be applied to any monitored sea turtle nesting population where nesting site fidelity and beach monitoring coverage remains high. This modelling approach can help nesting beach monitoring programmes forecast remigrant numbers based on prior climate data, and can further quantify anthropogenic mortality by validating survival estimates.",,,,"Santidrian-Tomillo, Pilar/N-5406-2014; Reina, Richard/AAC-7017-2019; Saba, Vincent/A-3799-2010","Santidrian-Tomillo, Pilar/0000-0002-6895-7218; Saba, Vincent/0000-0002-2974-4826",,,,,93,100,1,49,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

This conflict can be avoided through long-term planning efforts which use process-based geomorphic simulation modeling to forecast potential long-term (> 50 years) landscape-level effects of water management decisions on river meander migration. We describe two management conflicts from the Sacramento River, California, USA, and analyze alternative management scenarios using results from a meander migration and cutoff simulation model. The first example shows that the existing rock revetment upstream from Woodson Bridge State Recreation Area alters the river meandering and causes erosion problems. Removing the revetment would relocate the channel and create a natural meander-neck chute cutoff, reducing erosion at the park while providing ecosystem benefits. The second example suggests that although a bank revetment is needed to prevent the river from moving away from a major water pump, removing an upstream bank revetment would provide habitat benefits without causing pump facility problems. These examples demonstrate the benefits of taking a long-term, landscape-level view when implementing infrastructure projects in dynamic landscapes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The five statistical techniques included were: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS). The accuracy of the models was examined at three spatial resolutions (1, 25 and 100 ha) by area under the curve (AUC) and kappa statistics. All five modelling techniques had a relatively high discrimination capacity for the occurrence of clouded apollo. Classification tree analysis provided the least robust model performance. The differences between the other methods were small, although GAM and MARS provided marginally the best stability and performance. The most accurate models were developed for the resolutions of I ha (highest AUC values)and 25 ha (highest kappa values) and the least accurate models for the resolution of 100 ha. Our work shows that modern modelling techniques can provide useful forecasts of species distributions in unsurveyed parts of landscapes and provide valuable contributions to conservation and management planning. However, the success of applying the new modelling tools can be influenced by the choice of statistical technique and especially of spatial resolution. In conclusion, small changes in the spatial scale may result in a clear decrease in the model performance and thus caution should be exercised when implementing the models and their predictions in practice.

Complete specification of systems is impossible, so models must be simplified abstractions. Thus, the art of modeling involves deciding which system elements to include and determining how they should be represented. We view modeling as search through a space of candidate models that is guided by model objectives, theoretical knowledge, and empirical data. In this contribution, we introduce a method for representing process-based models that facilitates the discovery of structures that explain observed behavior. This representation casts dynamic systems as interacting sets of processes that act on entities. Using this approach, a modeler first encodes relevant ecological knowledge into a library of generic entities and processes, then instantiates these theoretical components, and finally assembles candidate models from these elements.

SAC is starting to be considered in the analysis of species distribution data, and over the last 10 years several studies have incorporated SAC into statistical models (here termed 'spatial models'). Here, I address the question of whether incorporating SAC affects estimates of model coefficients and inference from statistical models. Methods I review ecological studies that compare spatial and non-spatial models. Results In all cases coefficient estimates for environmental correlates of species distributions were affected by SAC, leading to a mis-estimation of on average c. 25%. Model fit was also improved by incorporating SAC. Main conclusions These biased estimates and incorrect model specifications have implications for predicting species occurrences under changing environmental conditions. Spatial models are therefore required to estimate correctly the effects of environmental drivers on species present distributions, for a statistically unbiased identification of the drivers of distribution, and hence for more accurate forecasts of future distributions.",,,,,"Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794",,,,,342,355,4,130,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Yet most attempts to introduce anadromous salmon failed until the onset of aquaculture by 1980. Escapes of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) from aquaculture after 1990 have apparently produced increasingly important reproductive returns ""naturalized"", to upper basins in Chile and Argentina south of 390 S. In this paper we show data on the historic and spatial occurrence of chinook salmon in four Pacific basins during the past decade. Our objective is to establish the progress of the settlement forecasting some ecosystem disruptions in order to project and manage potential impacts. In Chile, sampling took place from 1995 to 2005 including rivers Petrohue, Poicas, and Rio Negro-Hornopiren, and Lake Puyehue, in the X Region. In Argentina sampled rivers were Futaleufu, Carrenleufu and Pico. In Chile and Argentina reproductive Chinooks ranged in size between 73 and 130 cm total length, being the smallest sizes those of Lake Puyehue where the population is apparently landlocked. In Rio Petrohue, the size of the runs varied from year to year reaching in the peak season of 1996 and 2004 up to 500 kg of fish along 100 m of riverbank. Temporal distribution of juvenile Chinooks suggested mainly a typical ocean type as they are gone to sea within the first year of age. As seen in Petrohue, reproductive populations could import significant quantities of marine derived nutrients as they do in their original habitats thus disturbing natural cycles and balances. Chinook establishment in these pristine watersheds in southern South America poses new challenges for decision makers and fishermen since they may develop a fishery in the Pacific Ocean with consequences to other fishery resources. Additionally they also become a resource for sport fishing. Therefore there is the need of developing management tools and approaches to control the populations avoiding irreversible ecosystem disruptions and social conflicts.",,,,"Arismendi, Ivan/B-3144-2010","Arismendi, Ivan/0000-0002-8774-9350",,,,,61,66,0,17,,,,0716-078X,0717-6317,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

We applied recently developed risk assessment approaches to nonindigenous freshwater molluscs at two geographic scales: the Laurentian Great Lakes basin and the 48 contiguous states of the United States. We used data on natural history and biogeography to discriminate between established freshwater molluscs that are benign and those that constitute nuisances (i.e., cause environmental and/or economic damage). Two statistical techniques, logistic regression and categorical tree analysis, showed that nuisance status was positively associated with fecundity. Other aspects of natural history and biogeography did not significantly affect likelihood of becoming a nuisance. We then used the derived statistical models to predict the chance that 15 mollusc species not yet in natural ecosystems would cause damage if they become established. We also tested whether time since establishment is related to the likelihood that nonindigenous mollusc species in the Great Lakes and United States would cause negative impacts. No significant relationship was evident at the US. scale, but recently established molluscs within the Great Lakes were more likely to cause negative impacts. This may reflect changing environmental conditions, changing patterns of trade, or may be an indication of ""invasional meltdown.""

We found that fertilization leads to greater specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content which leads to greater productivity and faster litter decomposition, and that grazing leads to higher leaf toughness and leaf dry matter content which leads to lower productivity and slower decomposition compared to mowing. A state and transition model was used as a flexible conceptual tool for integrating data on community composition, plant traits, and ecosystem properties in the context of management-mediated successional dynamics in subalpine grasslands.

In alpine environments, the reproduction of birds and mammals is tightly linked to seasonality; therefore such alterations may have strong repercussions on recruitment. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a satellite-based measurement that correlates strongly with aboveground net primary productivity, to explore how annual variations in the timing of vegetation onset and in the rate of change in primary production during green-up affected juvenile growth and survival of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in four different populations in two continents. We indexed timing of onset of vegetation growth by the integrated NDVI (INDVI) in May. The rate of change in primary production during green-up ( early May to early July) was estimated as ( 1) the maximal slope between any two successive bimonthly NDVI values during this period and ( 2) the slope in NDVI between early May and early July. The maximal slope in NDVI was negatively correlated with lamb growth and survival in both populations of bighorn sheep, growth of mountain goat kids, and survival of Alpine ibex kids, but not with survival of mountain goat kids. There was no effect of INDVI in May and of the slope in NDVI between early May and early July on juvenile growth and survival for any species. Although rapid changes in NDVI during the green-up period could translate into higher plant productivity, they may also lead to a shorter period of availability of high-quality forage over a large spatial scale, decreasing the opportunity for mountain ungulates to exploit high-quality forage. Our results suggest that attempts to forecast how warmer winters and springs will affect animal population dynamics and life histories in alpine environments should consider factors influencing the rate of changes in primary production during green-up and the timing of vegetation onset.",,,,"von Hardenberg, Achaz/C-7313-2008","von Hardenberg, Achaz/0000-0002-9899-1687; Festa-Bianchet, Marco/0000-0002-2352-3379",,,,,173,174,5,124,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2007,88,2,,,,,381,390,,10.1890/06-0875,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000245668400012,17479756,,,,

Understanding the mechanism and providing accurate prediction of ABs' formation and occurrence is of foremost importance in relation to the protection of sensitive marine resources. In this paper, a multivariate time series model, namely the vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) and the long memory filter is proposed to model and predict ABs. To evaluate the effectiveness of this VARX model, both daily and 2-h field monitoring data of chlorophyll fluorescence (CHL), dissolved oxygen (DO), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), water temperature (TEMP), solar radiation (SR) and wind speed (WS) obtained at Kat O, Hong Kong, between February 2000 and March 2003 were employed. Unlike the other data driven approaches, this VARX model not only provides more interpretable effects of specific lags of environmental factors, but also sheds light on the feedback effects of AB on these variables. In general, daily CHL measurements up to 4 days can provide crucial information for predicting algal dynamics, while the VARX model is able to explicitly reveal ecological relationships between CHL and other environmental factors. In addition, the application of long-memory filter can further extract patterns of seasonal variations which is thought to be correspondent to the variation of algal species in Hong Kong water. With a view to providing an early warning signal of AB to fishermen and regulatory authorities, an alarming system was developed based on the VARX model; it could achieve 83% correct prediction of AB occurrences with a lead time of 2.5 days. Concerning the forecast performance of the VARX model, daily forecasting performance is comparatively better than that of artificial neural network models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, ecological models are built using occurrence data from a species' native range to predict the distribution in areas that the species may invade. However, historical and geographical constraints can limit a species' native distribution. Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP), an ecological niche modeling program, was used to predict the potential distribution of the invasive, freshwater New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, in Australia and North America. We compared the strength of the predictions made by models built with data from the snail's native range in New Zealand to models built with data from the locations invaded by the species. A time-series analysis of the Australian models demonstrated that range-of-invasion data can make better predictions about the potential distribution of invasive species than models built with native range data. Large differences among the model forecasts indicate that uncritical choice of the data set used in training the GARP models can result in misleading predictions. The models predict a large expansion in the range of P. antipodarum in both Australia and North America unless prevention measures are implemented rapidly.",,,,"Mac Nally, Ralph/A-5262-2008",,,,,,81,84,2,35,,,,1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In combination with a strong updraft or downdraft, this shear can provide the ingredients for rotation and possibly a tornado. Polarity reversal of lightning around the time of tornado touchdown also has been examined. Thus, increasing lightning flash rates and reversal of lightning strike polarity are potential indicators of possible tornado formation. This research examines these findings by conducting a GIS analysis of tornado and lightning data from a severe storm event on 9 May 2006, which occurred near the rural town of Anna, Texas. This storm produced several tornadoes ranging from F0 to F3. The lightning data show three distinct patterns in the 50 minutes prior to the first reported tornado touchdown, which include an increase in lightning strikes, an increase in the percent of positive polarity strikes, and a spatial concentration of strikes prior to touchdown along the path of the tornado.

We illustrate how this method also enhances the meaning of fuzzy spatial generalization rules and fuzzy association rules with a case study about weather pattern searching.

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether modelled patterns of climate parameters 6000 years ago can account for the European distribution of Fagus sylvatica at that time. Consideration is also given to the role of non-climatic parameters as driving forces of the Holocene spread and population expansion of F. sylvatica. Location Europe. Methods European distributions were simulated using a physiologically-based bioclimatic model (STASH) driven by three different atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) outputs for 6000 years ago. Results The three simulations generally showed F. sylvatica to have potentially been as widespread 6000 years ago as it is today, which gives a profound mismatch with pollen-based reconstructions of the F. sylvatica distribution at that time. The results indicate that drier conditions during the growing season 6000 years ago could have caused a restriction of the range in the south. Poorer growth conditions with consequently reduced competitive ability were modelled for large parts of France. Main conclusions Consideration of the entire European range of F. sylvatica showed that no single driving force could account for the observed distributional limits 6000 years ago, or the pattern of spread during the Holocene. Climatic factors, particularly drought during the growing season, are the likely major determinants of the potential range. Climatic factors are regionally moderated by competition, disturbance effects and the intrinsically slow rate of population increase of F. sylvatica. Dynamic vegetation modelling is needed to account for potentially important competitive interactions and their relationship with changing climate. We identify uncertainties in the climate and pollen data, as well as the bioclimatic model, which suggest that the current study does not identify whether or not climate determined the distribution of F. sylvatica 6000 years ago. Pollen data are better suited for comparison with relative abundance gradients rather than absolute distributional limits. These uncertainties from a study of the past, where we have information about plant distribution and abundance, argue for extreme caution in making forecasts for the future using equilibrium models.",,,,"Bradshaw, Richard HW/H-8663-2013; Giesecke, Thomas/A-2450-2013; Hickler, Thomas/AAE-8577-2019; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Giesecke, Thomas/N-6395-2019","Bradshaw, Richard HW/0000-0002-7331-2246; Giesecke, Thomas/0000-0002-5132-1061; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Giesecke, Thomas/0000-0002-5132-1061",,,,,102,103,0,31,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Models forecast continued changes in temperature, salinity, and solar radiation (insolation) in the world's oceans as consequences of global warming. Many species with a swimming jellyfish stage also have a benthic stage that asexually produces buds and new jellyfish (ephyrae). This perennial benthic stage probably determines the numbers of jellyfish in the population. In this study, polyps of the moon jellyfish Aurelia labiata from Puget Sound, Washington, USA, were tested in 9 combinations of temperature (7, 10, 15 degrees C) and salinity (20, 27, 34) in the dark, and in 9 combinations of photoperiod (12, 8, and 4 h d(-1)) and light intensity (1 screen, 2 screens, opaque) at ambient salinity (27) and temperature (15 degrees C). Another experiment tested polyps in treatments of 10, 15, and 20 degrees C. Survival of the initial polyps in all treatments was high (83 to 100%). Temperature, salinity, and their combination dramatically affected the numbers of ephyrae produced (from nearly 0 at 7 degrees C to 42 ephyrae polyp(-1) at 15 degrees C), the percentages of ephyrae out of total asexual reproduction (<= 12 % at 7 degrees C to 89% at 20 degrees C), and the delay before ephyra production (>81 d at 7 degrees C but only 39 to 46 d at 15 degrees C). Thus, all results showed that more jellyfish were produced with increasing temperature. Long photoperiod and highest light intensity greatly accelerated strobilation, with polyps in 12 h light strobilating 30 to 40 d before those in other treatments. Polyps receiving the most light strobilated most frequently. In situ conditions showed that light increased much more rapidly than temperature before strobilisation, suggesting that light may be the more important signal. I suggest that the light-sensitive hormone melatonin, or a precursor like serotonin, coordinates the timing of strobilation in A. labiata with the seasonal light cycle.",,,,"Purcell, Jennifer E/E-9991-2011",,,,,,87,103,1,49,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Quantifying this variability is essential to resolve ecosystem responses to eutrophication from variability imposed by climate. We developed a 'synoptic climatology' from surface sea-level pressure (SLP) maps to categorize and quantify atmospheric circulation patterns and address climate forcing of phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay. The 10 patterns we identified had unique frequencies-of-occurrence and associated meteorological conditions (i.e. precipitation, temperature, wind speed and direction). Four measures of phytoplankton biomass, surface chlorophyll a (B), euphotic layer chlorophyll a (B-eu), water column chlorophyll a (B-wc), and total biomass (B-tot), were obtained from remotely sensed ocean color data spanning 16 yr (1989 to 2004) combined with concurrent shipboard data. Years with more frequent warm/wet weather patterns had spring blooms that reached peak biomass farther seaward in the estuary, were greater in magnitude, occurred later in the spring, and covered a larger area than years with a predominance of cool/dry weather patterns. Frequencies of winter weather patterns were used to forecast spring B, B-eu, B-wc, and B-tot, explaining between 23 and 89% of the variance in the regional time-series. Residuals from these models did not show time-trends attributable to either accelerating eutrophication or management actions intended to decrease nutrient loadings. These findings extend our understanding of climatic influences on phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay by quantifying the effects of synoptic climate variability on spring bloom intensity, thereby supporting forecasts of seasonal phytoplankton biomass based on sub-continental scale weather patterns in this mid-Atlantic estuary.",,,,,"Miller, W.

We used the scyphomedusa Chrysaora quinquecirrha as a model to examine physical factors that control jellyfish populations and to develop an ecological forecasting system. Over 700 in situ observations collected from Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries during 1987-2000 were used to develop habitat models that predict the probability of occurrence and the likely concentration of medusae as a function of sea-surface temperature and salinity. Medusae were found within a relatively narrow range of temperature (26 to 30 C) and salinity (10 to 16). Regression analyses reveal that a combination of temperature and salinity is a significant predictor of medusa occurrence. Assessments of the predictive performance of these models using medusae and environmental data collected at independent survey sites (n = 354) indicated that model-predicted medusa occurrence and concentration correspond well with observations. Our models can be forced with near-real time and retrospective estimates of temperature and salinity to generate probability of occurrence maps of C. quinquecirrha medusa presence and abundance in order to better understand how this top predator varies in space and time, and how this species could potentially affect energy flow through the Chesapeake Bay system.",,,,"Purcell, Jennifer E/E-9991-2011; Brown, Christopher W./B-8213-2008; hood, raleigh/F-9364-2013","Brown, Christopher W./0000-0002-9905-6391; ",,,,,67,72,0,34,,,,0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Most of the models applied for simulating regional behaviour are general crop simulation models or crop-specific simulation models. The models, which use cultivar specific information, are difficult to apply on regional scale. The reason is that more than one crop cultivar are grown in even very small geographical regions. The present study is one step ahead in the direction of regional application of a crop simulation model, in which we calibrated and validated the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES) model to simulate the averaged conditions for wheat and barley. The model was calibrated to the data of two plots for the years 1993-1994 for winter wheat and for the year 1994-1995 for winter barely. The performance of the calibrated model was verified on an independent data set (one plot of 1993-1994 and three plots of 1997-1998 for winter wheat and one plots of 1994-1995 for winter barley) and the data set, which was not used for the calibration such as water and nitrogen dynamics in soil. The results showed that the model could very well simulate the crop variables such as crop phenology, above- and below-ground biomass and grain yield (The root mean square error (RMSE) was below 20% and the coefficient of determination (R-2) value more than 0.85, which was significant at 90% probability level). The performance of the model for simulating water dynamics in different soil layers was also good with RMSE less than 20% and a correlation coefficient more than 0.69 (t >= 48. 10; p < 0.001). However, the model showed limited accuracy in simulating nitrogen dynamics (nitrate and ammonium). The model performance for simulating nitrate content was satisfactory to some extent as the model could at least capture the trends of nitrate dynamics in different soil layers (correlation coefficient more than 0.61, which is significant on 99% probability level, t >= 4.41; p < 0.001), but the ability of the model to simulate ammonium dynamics in soil is poor (RMSE more than 20% and correlation coefficient less than 0.23).",,,,"Kersebaum, Kurt Christian/A-7558-2010","Kersebaum, Kurt Christian/0000-0002-3679-8427","DAAD, Bonn, GermanyDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Leibniz-Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF)","Authors acknowledge the organizer committee for organizing workshop on Modelling water and nutrient dynamics in soil-crop systems at ZALF Muncheberg, Germany and endowing with data for the study.

It is this that differentiates the emergency service call centre from other call centre categories. The focus of this paper is to model the resource allocation within the NSW Police Assistance Line (NSWPAL), which is a multi-site, multi-queue, multi-server call centre that takes urgent and non-urgent calls from the community of New South Wales, Australia. The major resource for NSWPAL is its Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) who answer the calls and, although multi-skilled, may not be equally skilled across the queues. The business case for the model is simple. Staff costs are a major consideration for the call centre with unscheduled incoming calls on the different queues leading to additional staff costs. Although rostering of staff for the queues is based on historical forecasts, one of the challenges in running a multi-queue centre is to staff the queues to meet the unexpected demands, especially during emergencies. This leads to the shuffling of staff to meet the load and invariably affects the service level of one of the queues. One such event occurred in July 2007 during a normally busy period. The inbound call rate was such that, although all calls were answered, service level fluctuated and could not be maintained at the target level for a period of time. It is these situations that we aim to model to examine staffing policies and real-time management regimes. The literature suggests that traditional modelling techniques will not provide the flexibility required to model the call centre. In this paper we propose an agent-based model of the call centre, with the main agents being callers, call distribution manager, Team Leader, CSRs and the queues. The objective of the model is to improve the business through generating practices that lead to better customer service level metrics at reduced costs through more efficient resource allocation. The agent based model provides the flexibility to model the resource allocation without having to commit considerable computing resources and undertaking a rigorous mathematical approach. The model uses the extensive data base of the call centre to provide information for modelling the agents. In this paper we describe the model at the systems level and present the agent-based model we will be using.",,,,"Chivers, William/D-3601-2013","Chivers, William/0000-0002-9731-5441",,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,11,17,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700005,,,,,

Plant disease risk systems are often used to estimate environmental conditions that are favourable for risk of disease epidemics and fungicide recommendations appropriate to that risk. Meteorological data has been included in these systems for well over 50 years. The inclusion of extended range synoptic forecast data into risk estimation models renders such systems even more valuable to growers by providing prediction of risk conditions up to several days in advance of their occurrence. This paper describes the development and implementation of a series of artificial neural network models to incorporate synoptic weather forecasts into an expert system for potato late blight risk. Potato late blight serves as an excellent test case for such models, as late blight risk systems have included weather variables since the 1960s. Previous attempts to use synoptic weather forecasts in plant pathology have had limited results because of the quality of forecast data. However, since 2003 the National Weather Service (NWS) of the United States has implemented new medium extended (MEX) forecast models that have improved their usefulness for plant pathology applications. The number of stations throughout the US with daily model output statistics (MOS) available publicly has also increased dramatically in recent years. Initial analysis of the new forecast MOS began in 2005. The twelve NWS stations with the longest MOS archive lengths for the state of Michigan were used to determine what the optimal modelling approach and average accuracy would be. Determinacy analysis, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks were each examined for their utility in predicting agricultural risk in potatoes from late blight. Model variables taken directly from and derived from the MOS data included spatial, temporal, and weather based variables. The models proved successful in predicting potato late blight risk as estimated by potato late blight disease severity values (DSV) up to four days in advance of their occurrence. Model results were significantly higher than predicting no risk every day, which would yield a state average accuracy of 72 percent. High and low risk periods, optimized as a function of the frequency of risk days through time in the growing season for each station, were significant in every type of model. The artificial neural network models achieved the highest overall accuracy (79 percent) and the highest accuracy in July and August when weather is particularly favourable for the disease in this region. In recent years, as longer data records of MOS have become available and additional station locations have been added to the network, it has become important to examine the usefulness of generalized state models, developed from regional locations with long archive records, at a more local scale. The south central region of Michigan was chosen for this analysis as ten prediction locations have been added in close proximity (within 70 km) of one of the first order stations (JXN). Lack of archive data for the newer stations is the main cause of concern when using the same modelling approach at a local level, especially with regard to station specific variables such as high and low risk time period. Preliminary analysis of the regional scale showed that station specific risk time periods resulted in lower accuracies than those derived from regional normals when archive records of only one year were available. In general, the artificial neural network model developed at the scale of the state did not appear be acceptable at the regional scale. Further research will focus on regional scale variables that may be used to increase the range of usefulness of such a model without requiring respecification for every station location individually.",,,,,,"USDA North Central Integrated Pest Management Center, IPM Enhancement Grants Program","Continued development of the model and implementation throughout the state of Michigan is currently funded through USDA North Central Integrated Pest Management Center, IPM Enhancement Grants Program.",,,0,0,0,2,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,94,100,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700017,,,,,

Phase systems identify a subset of years (analogues) that have the same phase for a particular month. Industries can then investigate how the response of interest varied historically by the SOI or SST phase and self-validate the system. This is possible because industry members will remember the big wet and big dry years. Phase systems also allow industry personnel to visualise distributional shifts in rainfall and other responses (e. g. yield) between the different phases. These components spark a great deal of interest and enthusiasm at case study meetings. The simplicity of phase systems contributes to increased understanding of the forecasting approach, and highlights both the strengths and limitations associated with seasonal climate forecasting. Given that climate forecasts are not a perfect science, it is important that industries understand the risks and probability concepts so they can better integrate forecasts into a decision-making framework. The Australian sugar industry has predominantly used the five-phase SOI climate forecasting system as its benchmark in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of the benchmark system with other phase-based climate forecasting systems. Three-phase and nine-phase SST forecasting systems and a three-phase SOI system formed part of the investigation. An assessment is made across the sugarcane growing regions and across the calendar year, simultaneously. This is done for seven sugar growing regions that collectively produce approximately 90% of Australia's sugar. A methodology that enables a fair comparison of the systems is presented. This methodology caters for the different number of phases with each forecasting system. We consider three performance measures: P-values of (i) the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test statistic, (ii) a linear error in probability space (LEPS) skill score and (iii) a relative operating characteric (ROC) skill score for above and below median rainfall. P-values are used to overcome obstacles associated with the different numbers of phases. This is important since, by chance alone, it is easier to get a higher or better categorical LEPS score for systems that have more phases. Results can vary with the performance measure. If ROC- and LEPS-based performance measures were preferred, then the three-phase SST system produced a higher number of significant results across the regions and three-month rolling periods. If performance measures that reflect the degree of distributional shifts or discriminatory ability between phases are preferred, then the five-phase SOI system produced the highest number of significant fields. Taking into consideration dependencies and auto-correlations associated with the response measurements across the calendar year and across coastal regions which essentially differ in latitudinal positioning, it is important to assess the likelihood that the number of significant fields could have occurred purely by chance. Whilst a methodology for comparing different phase systems, where the number of phases varies from system to system is presented, the dilemma as to which performance measures to base decisions remains. Users must carefully consider which performance measures are most appropriate for their investigation.",,,,"everingham, yvette/A-8399-2012","Everingham, Yvette/0000-0002-2583-4365",,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,574,581,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700086,,,,,

Irrigation allocation forecasts, particularly in the form of continuous exceedence probabilities, may thus assist irrigators in qualifying the climatic risk they take in their decision making. The exceedence probability is the probability that the actual outcome will equal or exceed a specified outcome during a given time period (Piechota et al. 2001). This paper compares the results obtained from five different approaches to obtaining continuous exceedence probability forecasts of the irrigation allocation at the end of the irrigation season (May) for gravity irrigators in the Goulburn catchment of northern Victoria. These forecasts were obtained at the start of the irrigation season (August). Irrigation allocations in the Goulburn catchment are primarily dependent upon the volume of water in the various reservoirs at the beginning of the season, and the inflows to the reservoirs during the season. The first approach (DF) was to use the reservoir levels at the beginning of the irrigation season, as well as a climatic indicator, to directly obtain a forecast of the final irrigation allocation. The second approach (ISF) was to forecast the individual inflows, based on antecedent inflows and a climatic indicator, and then use a hydrological simulation model to obtain the irrigation allocations based on these forecast inflows and the actual reservoir levels at the beginning of the irrigation season. The third approach (ICS) was the same as the second, except that climatological values of the inflows were used. The fourth approach (TSF) was to forecast the total inflow to the system, then disaggregate this into the individual inflows according to the typical distribution, and then use the hydrological model to obtain the forecasts of irrigation allocations based on these forecast inflows and the actual reservoir levels at the beginning of the irrigation season. The fifth approach (TCS) was the same as the fourth except that the total climatological inflow was used. It was found that using an El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicator as well as the initial reservoir levels as predictors did not improve the skill of direct forecasts (DF). However, using ENSO indicators as predictors did improve the skill of the inflow forecasts. For most inflows, the use of the Darwin mean sea level pressure anomaly, along with antecedent flow, was found to give the highest skill, as measured using the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (E) and the modified Linear Error in Probability Space (LEPS). The correlation between the various inflows and ENSO indicators was not significantly improved by the addition of indices of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, or the Southern Annular Mode. The skill level of the irrigation allocation forecasts was measured using E and the Ranked Probability Skill Score (RPSS). The irrigation allocations obtained using all five forecasting approaches were found to give significantly better skill than climatological irrigation allocations. Although the DF approach gave the highest E and RPSS skill level, this method was unsatisfactory at low risk levels, as the forecasts were often less than the allocations that would actually be obtained even if there was no streamflow in the coming season. Irrigation allocation forecasts obtained using streamflow forecasts (ISF and TSF approaches) showed higher skill than those obtained using climatological streamflows (ICS and TCS approaches). There was little difference in skill between irrigation allocation forecasts obtained using individual streamflow forecasts (ISF), and those obtained from disaggregating forecasts of the total inflow (TSF).",,,,"Malano, Hector M/F-1562-2015","Malano, Hector M/0000-0001-6387-7078",,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,603,609,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700090,,,,,

The initial water allocation announcement is very conservative as the allocations are based on storage levels and historical minimum inflows statistics to dams during the irrigation seasons. There is a good chance that the water allocations will be increased as the season proceeds. Water availability during the cropping season is a major factor influencing planting decisions made by irrigators and can have a major bearing on the financial viability and irrigation efficiency of irrigation areas. Therefore, increased knowledge on the likely end-of-season allocation by advance predictions can assist in minimising cropping risk and can help optimise farm returns and achieve better irrigation efficiencies. Seasonal river flow forecasts are used for determining anticipated water allocations; however, this paper presents a more direct approach that forecasts water allocation instead of river flow. The study is based on the hypothesis that the sea-surface temperature (SST) and ocean based climate variability indices (CVIs) are statistically related to water allocation forecasts in a river catchment. Over 100-years data on a global two degree grid SST, CVIs, and water allocations in the Murray Irrigation Area (MIA) were analysed. Statistical techniques including probability analysis and multiple linear regression (MLR) were used to determine the underlying relationships among predictor variables and the end-of-irrigation-season water allocation (February allocation) in the MIA. The SST at three locations around the continent; one lying in the equatorial Pacific, second in the Indian Ocean and third in the Tasmanian Sea, were found highly correlated (Pearson Correlation Coefficient up to -0.83) with February allocation levels in the MIA based on analysis using the CSIRO's SSTman software. The significant variables identified by the MLR analyses include; SST, SOI, mean sea level pressure, start-of-season (August) and mid-of-season (October) announced allocations and the risk factor. The risk factor can be varied from 0 to 100% and relates the probability of February allocation to announced August allocation and translates degree of risk farmer may take based on known August allocation. The value of the risk factor must be chosen with care because if user/farmer decides a higher value of risk factor, the model will forecast higher allocation suggesting farmer to grow more crops but at the same time involve a higher degree of risk of actually not getting that level of allocation. The model was validated against actual announced allocations for the month of February for ten years (1996/97 to 2005/06). The validation results are presented in Figure 1A. The model underestimated allocations for the years 2001 and 2002. This may be due to borrowing water from future years despite exceptionally low rainfalls during the season and not taking into account then emerging drought conditions.

The lack of monitoring data for GBR catchments limits the refinement of these models, and particularly their assumptions of tropical landscape processes. Such limitations reduce the confidence of these models for application within the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan process, such as the setting of end-of-river load targets, and scenario load forecasting based on improved catchment condition from the adoption of best management practices. The benefits of a coupled monitoring and modelling approach have been demonstrated in a number of other north Queensland catchments, such as the Tully/Murray Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) (Armour et al., 2007). Improved modelling estimates have been produced for these catchments due to their smaller size, resultant less variability and the use of higher resolution input data. The considerable size of the Burdekin makes similar efforts difficult; however, this is a first attempt at comparing available monitoring data with modelling efforts for this catchment. We present flow weighted sediment and nitrogen loads averaged over three wet seasons of monitoring data (2002/03, 2004/05 and 2005/06) from the major sub-catchments and river mouth of the Burdekin River to compare with recent SedNet and ANNEX model load estimates by CSIRO. CSIRO incorporated a number of refinements to the models based on issues identified during previous modelling runs. These refinements include improvements to the hillslope erosion component through better input data resolution (estimates of actual ground cover and improved spatial resolution of slope) and improved gully and river bank erosion components through the incorporation of field measurements from the Burdekin catchment. In most cases, monitored and modelled comparisons of TSS loads were reasonable, although poorer comparisons occurred for some sites, explainable by limited monitoring data or coarse resolution ""blanket"" model assumptions, such as riparian vegetation and dam trapping capacity. The dam trapping algorithm applied to the Burdekin Falls Dam (BFD) by the SedNet model appears to be overestimating the suspended sediment and particulate nutrient trapping capacity of this dam. A modified algorithm that accounts for the dry tropical hydrology (i.e. highly episodic flows with shorter residence times than assumed by SedNet) will allow for better load estimates at the mouth of the Burdekin River. Particulate nutrient comparisons were less satisfactory, with the model seemingly overestimating monitored PN exports; the ANNEX model estimates are based on the Australian Soil Resource Information System database of nutrient concentrations in soils. This database may need refinement for these highly weathered, nutrient-poor landscapes. Reasonable comparisons were found between the modelled and monitored loads of dissolved organic nitrogen, however, comparisons were only fair for dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Further investigation of the role of inorganic nitrogen in this tropical system is warranted, and particularly, the contributions from natural sources, such as rainfall or bedrock, compared to those from land uses including fertilisers and cow excreta. Additional monitoring data at different spatial and temporal scales are required to further test the accuracy of these models, particularly for the southern region of the Burdekin catchment, where below-average flow events have occurred within the timeframe of the monitoring project. This will allow further confidence in using modelled outputs to identify catchment point sources and consequent delivery to downstream environments, and for the setting of water quality targets.",,,,"Lewis, Stephen/P-7205-2016","Lewis, Stephen/0000-0002-6929-6626; Bainbridge, Zoe/0000-0001-9814-4421",,,,,6,6,0,14,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,874,880,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700129,,,,,

Engle (1982) proposes an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model to capture the time-varying volatility of inflation rates in the United Kingdom. Weiss (1984) finds evidence of ARCH in the US industrial production. The ARCH model is then extended to generalized ARCH (GARCH) models by Bollerslev (1986) and exponential GARCH models by Nelson (1991). Recently Stock and Watson (2002) find that a substantial reduction in the variability of the US output growth since the early 1980s can be explained by a reduction in the variance of macroeconomic shocks. However, a few researchers have attempted to formally model asymmetries in the conditional variance of business-cycle variables (see Brunner 1992, Hamori 2000, and Ho and Tsui 2001, 2003 and 2004). All these studies are confined to univariate GARCH analysis. One major drawback of the univariate GARCH framework is that it does not capture the co-movement of business-cycle variables, nor analyze the empirical evidence of asymmetric volatilities in the context of multivariate GARCH approach. In this paper, we use the multivariate GARCH framework to investigate the evidence of asymmetric volatility and time-varying conditional correlations between sectors of the monthly US industrial production (IIP) indices in 1961-1997. We propose three new multivariate asymmetric GARCH models, which are developed based on a synthesis and improvement of the methodologies of Ding et al (1993), Sentana (1995) and Tse and Tsui (2002), including the VC-Quadratic GARCH (VC-QGARCH) model, VC-Leveraged GARCH (VC-LGARCH) model, and VC-Threshold GARCH (VC-TGARCH) model. Our proposed models are computationally manageable and are capable of capturing features of volatility asymmetry and the path of time-varying correlations. The issues of conditional heteroskedasticity and volatility asymmetry of business cycles are important because of their implications on macroeconomic and business cycle theory, measurement and forecasting. If business cycles are conditionally heteroskedastic and exhibit volatility asymmetry, then any theory assuming the absence of either of these properties is most likely inadequate. It is crucial to understand the potential macroeconomic policy implications of asymmetric volatility shocks for economies. If negative shocks induce greater future volatilities on IIP than positive shocks of the same magnitude, this might further vindicate the implementation of macroeconomic stabilisation measures by the government in times of recession. We use monthly data from the OECD website SourceOECD: Main Economic Indicators for the 5 sectoral IIP of the US: the Consumer Good (CG), the Investment Good (IG), the Manufacturing (M), the Non-Durables (ND) and the Raw Materials (RM) with 444 observations. The results show that negative shocks have a greater impact on future volatilities than positive shocks of the same magnitude for the 5 sectoral IIP series in the U. S. Most parameter estimates of the time-varying conditional correlation coefficient equation are significant at the 5% level, indicating that dynamic correlations probably exist among the 5 main industrial groups/sectors. The estimates of the time-invariant component of the correlation coefficient equation, rho, are significantly positive and broadly similar to those estimates from the constant conditional correlations models, which is consistent with Lucas' (1977) observation More importantly, the pattern of conditional correlations and the magnitude of rho differ among the 10 sectoral pairs, ranging from a low of 0.2763 (IG-ND pair) to 0.7652 (M-RM pair) and 0.8363 (CG-M pair). This is consistent with results from the VC-LGARCH model. The findings on asymmetric effects have policy implications for government to consider the effective countercyclical measures during recessions.",,,,"Zhang, Zhaoyong/D-5100-2013","Zhang, Zhaoyong/0000-0001-9596-2648",,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,933,939,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700138,,,,,

Many traditional financial models have assumed constant volatilities and correlations among returns, but empirical evidence have shown them to vary significantly over time, and much effort has been put into the modeling and forecasting of their properties and structure. Over time, the availability of data for increasingly shorter return horizons has enabled practitioners to narrow the frequencies of their volatility models. However, progress has stalled over the modeling of daily return volatilities, partly due to standard volatility models' general inability to handle intraday data, while few high-dimensional models have been suggested for practical use as well. As for several notable multivariate autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and stochastic volatility models being proposed, namely Bollerslev, Engle and Nelson (1994) and Ghysels, Harvey and Renault (1996), have also been challenged for being unable to deal with more than a few assets simultaneously. At the same time, others have relied on ad hoc, model-free approaches like simple exponential smoothing based on the counterfactual assumption of conditionally normally distributed returns, or through squared returns over the relevant return horizon, which in turn does not account for the presence of noise. The limitations of the above approaches have led researchers to seek an alternative framework. Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Ebens (2001) (henceforth ABDE) and Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002) both turned to a new ""realized volatility"" approach. In particular, ABDE proposed using continuously recorded transaction prices and by summing squares and cross-products of intraday high-frequency returns, they constructed estimates known as ex post realized daily volatilities. Under the theory of quadratic variation, the realized daily volatility obtained is an unbiased and highly efficient estimator of return volatility. The advantages of such a measure are that the volatility measures are model-free, and are free from measurement error as the sampling frequency of the returns approaches infinity. Under the realized volatility approach, ABDE (2001) focused on 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). They also settled down on 5-minute intervals as the effective ""continuous time record"" so as to tackle microstructure frictions such as bid-ask bounce effects and price discreteness. Meanwhile, Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys (2003) again adopted a similar approach to estimate exchange rate volatilities, while choosing 30-minute intervals. Nevertheless, we observed that similar studies on high-frequency financial data have mainly concentrated on developed markets while relatively little has been done on emerging markets like Hong Kong. This paper is a preliminary attempt to study the volatility structure of shares listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx) using transaction data. Here, we will follow ABDE (2001) approach on high-frequency financial data to observe the volatility structure of Hong Kong shares. Meanwhile, due to the need for high-frequency price observations, we would focus on the constituents stocks of HSI and HSCEI for all transactions between January 2004 and December 2005. Using the sample of constituent stocks of Hang Seng Index (HSI) and Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI or ""H-shares Index""), we found that the mean daily realized volatilities of HSCEI to be significantly higher than its HSI counterpart, while the correlations between H-shares stay relatively lower than that of HSI stocks. A long-memory effect is also reported for the logarithmic standard deviations of all shares, with most of them showing slow decay over the series.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,947,953,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030700140,,,,,

On the other hand, the Japanese government has released another CLI for detecting the Japanese business turning points. Both CLIs are widely used alternatives. The OECD's CLI is composed of 8 component series, whereas the Japanese CLI is based on 12 component series. In addition, the component series of the indexes are different. Consequently, these two CLIs may provide different business forecasts. When different forecasts occur, how can we interpret the discrepancies? This paper tries to answer this question by clarifying their relationships. More precisely, we identify the turning points of the two CLIs, and we try to find whether evident relationships exist. For identifying the turning points of them, we take two approaches. One is to use the frequency selective filter of Iacobucci and Noullez (2005). The other approach is to use the Bry and Boschan (1971) methodology. We additionally examine the properties of the two indexes for detecting the Japanese business turning points. We also evaluate the degree of comovements of the two cycles by the methods proposed by Harding and Pagan (2002, 2006). Our empirical findings, based on the data from April 1973 to January 2007, are: 1. The locations of the turning points of the two indexes are almost the same (even though their component series are different). 2. With a few exceptions, the OECD's index provides earlier signals for the next turning point than does the Japanese government's index. The averages of the differences are 0.5 and 1.6 months, depending on filtering methods. 3. The empirical results concerning the degree of synchronization indicate that the OECD's index provides about one month earlier signals for the next turning point than does the Japanese government's index. 4. The average leading months of the two indexes are roughly the same, about one and one half years. Finally, two remarks are in order. First, in this paper, we did not investigate what produces the discrepancies of the properties of the two alternative CLIs. As stated earlier, the component series for the two CLIs are different. Further investigations are necessary to identify which components play an important role in producing them. Secondly, Harding and Pagan (2006) proposed the testing procedure of synchronization. It is of interest to statistically test whether or not the OECD's index provides about one month earlier signals for the next turning point than does the Japanese government's index.",,,,,,"KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [19530241]",We are grateful to Alessandra Iacobucci for providing us their MATLAB code to apply the HW filter.

This in turn requires access to data, processing algorithms, hydrological models and resulting information products used by several hundred agencies in the water resources sector. The Water Resources Observation Network Reference Model describes a process for developing a distributed interoperable framework for sharing information. This framework will enable the linking of data and processing services to forecasting and reporting technologies which will improve the visibility, currency and usability of water resources information. The Water Resources Observation Network (WRON) will allow for improved environmental, social and economic outcomes with respect to water. Development of the WRON Reference Model is guided by a set of policies, and defines several architectural principles to ensure the feasibility, flexibility, extensibility of the WRON. The policies include 'Adopt, Adapt, Invent', recognising the benefit of working, wherever possible, with existing standards, protocols or procedures, extending or adapting them if necessary, and only inventing where adoption or adaptation is not possible. A second guiding policy is that the WRON Reference Model should not contain anything that cannot be implemented - thus ensuring the practicality and usefulness of the framework. Architectural principles include 'adequate description' to ensure that sufficient information is available to use a resource, 'subscribe, not describe' - to encourage reuse of published service descriptions and minimise effort in establishing new services, and 'no private contracts' which prohibits unpublished or private agreements between components that would compromise the interoperability of the WRON. This paper introduces Version 0.1 of the WRON Reference Model and further describes the principles and policies outlined above. It also details the key components and information artefacts that compose the Reference Model, including registries to enable discovery, services and their descriptions or profiles, authoritative copies of data or caches and domain models for defining concepts within the domain.

The current combination method in hydroclimatology is mainly limited to mixing weights that remain static over time. Recently (Chowdhury and Sharma, 2006) and (Chowdhury et al., 2007) have proposed using time variant mixing weights as an improvement over the static weight combination. The method involves a dynamic hierarchical pair wise combination tree for outputs from multiple predictive models. The model pairs are first matched based on the sample error covariance. Then the pairs are combined by ascertaining a target weight for each time step. This process provides a low dimensional setting for investigating any predictive structure of the relative model strengths. The weights are predicted using a mixed distribution which is a product of a 'precision ratio' and a 'bias direction'. The precision ratio is the fraction of the squared residual error associated with each of the paired models, and the bias direction represents an indicator of the sign of the two residual errors. The precision ratio is projected forward using a generalised linear autoregressive model and the bias direction is projected by ordered logistic regression. The method is extended here to combine three climate models, the variables of interest being the monthly global sea surface temperature anomalies at 5 degrees grids for 1956 to 2001. This work is multivariate extension of our earlier univariate (NINO3.4) application (Chowdhury and Sharma, 2006). The prediction from static weight combination is used as base case for comparison. The predicted sea surface temperature using this dynamic combination algorithm consistently exhibited better accuracy to that of static combination in every season (Figure 1). Improved skill is achieved at 86% of the global grids with the rest showing indifference to static weight skills.

In recent years Europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods. Since 1998, floods have caused damages of some 700 facilities, the displacement of about half a million people and at least 25 billion Euro in insured economic losses. In the United States, about 90 percent of the damage caused by natural disasters is caused by floods and associated mud and debris flows. Reliable flood forecasting and adequate flood management could help to improve public safety and reduce economic losses. Performance of flood forecasting and flood risk management requires on the one hand technical prerequisites and on the other hand expert knowledge and experience. Thus, a functioning network of real-time climate and streamflow gauging stations, data transmitters, hydrodynamic models, inundation models, to name only a few, are representing the technical part. Water managers, scientists, decision makers etc. are representing the part of expert knowledge and experience sharing different tasks, such as, development of emergency plans, planning of flood protection infrastructure, hydrologic modelling, model development etc. Often it seems that expert knowledge and experience is only used to operate and develop the technical part of the system and to make decisions, but is not taken into consideration to be more integrated in the flood forecasting or flood risk assessment procedure. Obviously, the reason behind is that it is difficult to integrate experience, provided by local experts, as ""value"" into the model based methods. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods or to use existing methods to combine expert knowledge and experience with technical flood forecasting and risk assessment approaches. In order to make flood forecasting more reliable, particularly in data poor regions, it is necessary to make every piece of information available. Usually, the lack of data is more a lack of measured data, such as climate time series, than a lack of knowledge about system behaviour or cause and effect relations. Here we need strategies to make this kind of information more useful. Furthermore, modelling approaches have to be adapted to existing conditions, towards parsimonious models. Too often models are used only because they are well-known and based on sophisticated approaches, but require data that are usually not available. In the course of the European NeWater project, where the authors are involved in, a prototype of a GIS-based monitoring and information system is under development. The focus is on integrating different types of information, such as ""hard"" (quantitative, measured) and ""soft"" (qualitative) information. In the context of flood risk assessment expert knowledge in form of thresholds and understanding of cause and effect relations between environmental processes and variables influencing the water regime can be considered as ""soft"" information to be integrated in the overall system. Therefore, two different methods, Bayesian belief networks, and a fuzzy logic approach, are taken into consideration to structure and to transform expert knowledge into information about flood risk level. Conceptual rainfall-runoff models, requiring only precipitation and temperature as input, are used to perform flood forecasting, based on short-term weather forecast data. The system is composed of five modules, based on freely available open source software where the core is a Geographic Information System (SAGA) with an interface to a relational database management system (PostgreSQL / PostGIS). It incorporates the lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models IHACRES (Identification of unit Hydrographs and Component flows from Rainfalls, Evaporation and Streamflow data) and GR4J (Modeles Hydrologiques du Genie Rural) and an interface to integrate the expert knowledge-base.

The free source software implements a finite volume central-upwind Godunov method to solve the non-linear depth-averaged shallow water wave equations. In light of the renewed interest in tsunami forecasting and mitigation, this paper explores the use of ANUGA to model the inundation of the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004. The Method of Splitting Tsunamis (MOST) was used to simulate the initial tsunami source and the tsunami's propagation at depths greater than 100m. The resulting output was used to provide boundary conditions to the ANUGA model in the shallow water. Data with respect to 4-minute bathymetry, 2-minute bathymetry, 3-arc second bathymetry and elevation were used in the open ocean, shallow water and on land, respectively. A particular aim was to make use of the comparatively large amount of observed data corresponding to this event, including tide gauges and run-up heights, to provide a conditional assessment of the computational model's performance. Specifically we compared model tsunami depth with data collected at two tide gauges and 18 coastal run-up measurements. Comparison between observed and modelled run-up at 18 sites show reasonable agreement. We also find modest agreement between the observed and modelled tsunami signal at the two tide gauge sites. The arrival times of the tsunami is approximated well at both sites. The amplitude of the first trough and peak is approximated well at the first tide gauge (Taphao-Noi), however the amplitude of the first wave was underestimated at the second gauge (Mercator yacht). The amplitude of subsequent peaks and troughs, at both gauges, are underestimated and a phase lag between the observed and modelled arrival times of wave peaks is evident after the first peak. The performance of the model could be improved by using finer bathymetric data, which at present cannot be obtained by the authors. The bathymetry data used was insufficient. Local topographic features, such as small islands and shoreline elevations near run-up locations are not accurately represented. The arrival time and tsunami height could also be improved by calibrating the tsunami source on observed data such as the satellite transect of Jason 1 following the procedure of Grilli et al. (2006).

In response to the recommendation to ""develop and implement a five-year national program of systematic and rigorous disaster risk assessments"", Geoscience Australia (GA) is undertaking a series of national risk assessments for a range of natural hazards. Fundamental to any risk assessment is an understanding of the exposure including the number and type of buildings, businesses, infrastructure and people exposed to the hazard of interest. Presently there is no nationally consistent exposure database in existence for risk assessment purposes. It is important to emphasise that understanding the risks associated with various hazards requires more detailed information than the population and number of structures at a census district level. The understanding of building type, construction (roof and wall) type, building age, number of storeys, business type and replacement value is critical to understanding the potential impact on Australian communities from various hazards. The National Exposure Information System (NEXIS) is aimed at providing nationally consistent and best available exposure information at the building level. It requires detailed spatial analysis and integration of available demographic, structural and statistical data. Fundamentally, this system is developed from several national spatial datasets as a generic approach with several assumptions made to derive meaningful information. NEXIS underpins scenarios and risk assessments for various hazards. Included are earthquakes, cyclones, severe synoptic wind, tsunami, flood and technogenic critical infrastructure failure. It will be integrated with early warning and alert systems to provide real time assessment of damage or forecast the impact for any plausible hazards. This system is intended to provide a relative assessment of exposure from multiple hazards and provide the geographic distribution of exposure for regional planning. This will be at an aggregated census district level now and at a mesh block level in the future. The system is scoped to capture the residential, business (commercial and industrial), and ancillary (educational, government, community, religious, etc.) infrastructure. Currently the NEXIS architecture is finalised and the system provides residential exposure information. The prototype for business exposure is in progress. The system aims to capture ancillary buildings, infrastructure and various critical infrastructure sector exposures in future. More specific building and socio-economic information will be incorporated as new datasets or sources of information become available. The NEXIS will be able to provide the exposure information for the impact analysis for a region. This database will not support a site specific assessment involving one or two buildings and need more specific information about the particular exposure to estimate the risk at micro level.

Because land surface parameters are highly integrated states, errors in land surface forcing, model physics and parameterization tend to accumulate in the land surface stores of these models, such as soil moisture and surface temperature. This has a direct effect on the models' water and energy balance calculations, and may eventually result in inaccurate weather predictions. For the Oklahoma Mesonet data base surface temperature estimates obtained with a recently improved retrieval algorithm from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on board NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite are evaluated against different combinations of model output of the Community Noah Land Surface Model and Community Land Model (CLM2) operated within NASA/GSFC's Land Information System (LIS) and atmospheric forcing data of a variety of sources, i.e. the NCEP Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the North American Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), based on Eta data and supplemented with observation-based precipitation and radiation data. The surface temperature retrievals and LSM output are further evaluated against station measurements from the Mesonet observational grid in Oklahoma. Preliminary analysis presented here shows the satellite derived surface temperature estimates uncorrected for bias - are not necessarily superior to the LSM simulations, evaluated against the Mesonet observational grid benchmark. In general, data assimilation systems take into account observational errors and are able, despite errors in the observations, to obtain improvement of LSM results, as long as the temporal trends are well represented. Further, most assimilation systems use a bias removal prior to actual assimilation. Here, a simple (linear) correction decreases the AMSR T-s error beyond the error of simulated T-s.

Therefore variables such as latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat flux from the land surface, which provide the lower boundary condition for NWP, need to be as accurate as possible at the beginning of a forecast period. Land Surface Models (LSMs) such as the CSIRO Biosphere Model (CBM) represent the exchange of energy and water between the earth's surface and lower atmosphere and are used to calculate LE and H. Soil moisture and temperature states of these models help partition incoming energy to the earth's surface between LE and H. Producing accurate predictions of LE and H is hindered by inaccuracies in LSMs such as uncertain initial model state conditions, errors in model forcing data, errors in model physics and a lack of data for accurately parameterising models. Data assimilation blends observations of a model variable(s) with a model to update/correct the model and achieve more accurate predictions than by running the model offline. Assimilating soil moisture observations into LSMs is a proven technique for improving predictions of soil moisture and hence LE and H. Although, assimilating soil moisture may not necessarily lead to optimal LE and H predictions due to a complex and non-linear relationship between them. Assimilating LE and H observations has not been thoroughly explored in the scientific community and could potentially produce more accurate LE and H predictions. This study compares the assimilation of soil moisture observations with that of combined LE and H observations into the CBM with the resulting impacts on predictions of LE, H and root zone soil moisture and temperature examined. Assimilation experiments were performed with a 1-year series of data using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm. Observations and model forcing data were measured on a one-dimensional point scale at a site in south-eastern Australia. Errors were prescribed to initial conditions and to meteorological forcing variables. Observations were assimilated on typical remote sensing timescales - every 3 days for soil moisture (SMOS satellite) and twice daily with minimal cloud cover for LE and H (MODIS). Both observation sets were able to improve predicted soil moisture when assimilated compared to the offline model, with the soil moisture assimilation producing better results. Soil temperature predictions from both assimilation runs were worse than from the offline model indicating a warm bias. LE and H predictions are improved overall by both assimilation runs with LE and H assimilation producing the best predictions. It is demonstrated here that while surface soil moisture assimilation can improve soil moisture predictions in a LSM and consequently improve LE and H predictions, assimilating LE and H observations can produce more accurate LE and H predictions. Therefore the assimilation of LE and H observations into LSMs has the potential to provide NWP models with optimal LE and H estimates for initialisation.",,,,"Western, Andrew W/G-1730-2011; Walker, Jeffrey/D-2624-2009; Trudinger, Cathy/A-2532-2008","Western, Andrew W/0000-0003-4982-146X; Trudinger, Cathy/0000-0002-4844-2153; Walker, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4817-2712",,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1736,1742,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030701115,,,,,

However the soil moisture state predicted by land surface models, and subsequently used as the boundary condition in atmospheric models, is often unrealistic. New remote sensing technologies are able to observe surface soil moisture at the scales and coverage required by numerical weather prediction (NWP), and there is potential to improve modelled soil moisture, and ultimately atmospheric forecasts, through assimilation of this remotely sensed data into NWP models. Remotely sensed soil moisture is currently derived over Australia from passive microwave brightness temperatures from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), on NASA's Aqua satellite. In collaboration with NASA, the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) are producing soil moisture separately from C-band (6.92 GHz) and X-band (10.65 GHz) AMSR-E data. Due to radio frequency interference (RFI) in the C-band microwave frequencies over north America, NASA also produce a soil moisture product from X-band data only, using a different algorithm. The three soil moisture products identified above are assessed in this paper by comparison to i) in-situ soil moisture timeseries from the Murrumbidgee Soil Moisture Monitoring Network (MSMMN), and ii) spatial patterns of antecedent precipitation. Specifically, the three products are assessed to determine their relative performance, and whether any are sufficiently accurate for use in NWP models. The benchmark against which they are assessed is the current scheme used to initialise soil moisture in the Australian NWP model: the Limited Area Prediction System (LAPS). Within the microwave spectrum, lower frequencies are theoretically better suited to sensing soil moisture, and a priori the soil moisture derived from C-band AMSR-E data was expected to be superior to that from X-band data. However, this analysis has revealed only a minimal difference between the VUA-NASA soil moisture derived from C-and X-band data. Both had realistic spatial behaviour, and a high correlation to the MSMMN soil moisture timeseries, and both outperformed the soil moisture currently used in LAPS. In contrast, the soil moisture derived at NASA from X-band AMSR-E data is persistently very low, and has a low correlation with the MSMMN data. It does not offer an improvement over the current soil moisture used in LAPS. This poor performance is believed to be due to the algorithm used in the retrieval, rather than the use of higher frequency brightness temperatures, since the VUA-NASA product based on X-band data performed comparatively well. This analysis concludes that the VUA-NASA soil moisture derived from AMSR-E C-band data is the most appropriate for use in assimilation experiments with the Australian NWP system, since it had the best performance, and lower microwave frequencies are theoretically favoured for sensing soil moisture. However, in regions where RFI prevents the use of C-band data, the VUA-NASA X-band product could be used, since it performed comparably in this assessment.",,,,"Holmes, Thomas/F-4512-2010; de Jeu, Richard/AAE-6922-2019; Walker, Jeffrey/D-2624-2009; Draper, Clara/P-6097-2016","Holmes, Thomas/0000-0002-4651-0079; Draper, Clara/0000-0002-8299-4939",,,,,1,1,0,5,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1756,1762,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030701118,,,,,

Lumped nonlinear rainfall-runoff models are simple to construct but difficulties may be created in the calibration process if suboptimal fits to data arise from local minima in the objective function measuring goodness of fit, where small fit values indicate improved fit. One approach to fitting nonlinear models is to formulate calibration procedures which are hopefully robust against local minima when seeking the global minumum. An alternative approach is advocated here whereby threshold effects and other nonlinearities are approximated in models comprised of a large number of weighted hydrograph components. All these components are of ""hydrograph-like"" nonlinear form, but the forms themselves are fixed and not some function of nonlinear parameters. The weights can be obtained via any constrained polynomial function of previous rainfall events, water table heights, or upstream discharge. This allows for dynamic variation of hydrograph form with current catchment state, while with the model itself is still linear and subject only to linear constraints. It could be argued that linear weighted mixtures are as much ""hydrological"" in principle as parsimonious nonlinear models. However, the price paid for the simple model structure is the generation of a large number of correlated parameters, corresponding to the coefficients of the functions defining the N weight values of the N hydrograph components. A linear programming approach is used to avoid the numerical instability that would arise from least-squares fitting with many correlated parameters and possibly a relatively small calibration set. On the basis of 25 weighted Gumbel distributions, a 100-parameter linear model was constructed with the weights being defined from quadratic functions of the current and previous rainfall in unit time. In the result shown in Figure 1, the calibration data set contained less observations than model parameters and the validation ( forecast) discharges were beyond the range of the calibration data. Despite this extreme violation of good modelling practice, the calibration via linear programming was straightforward ( and in fact was done using the Excel Solver) and the model fared surprisingly well in this particular instance as a flood-peak forecaster. However, the potential of this interesting procedure is still entirely tentative at this stage and requires further applications to both larger calibration sets and pre-flood forecast calibrations for forecasting purposes.

In areas with a quantitative forecast service, height forecasts are provided for key locations. The state of the ocean can have a significant impact on the height of rivers at coastal locations. Tidal influences and storm surges can lead to much higher river heights and greater areas of inundation than would be expected from flow from the rainfall alone. The Bureau of Meteorology uses the URBS (Carroll 1998) rainfall runoff routing model to model flood heights at key locations around Australia. An important part of the forecast process is the conversion from flow to height using ""rating curves"". These curves can vary depending on downstream conditions. This feature is used to more accurately model height at locations that have a tidal influence. In this paper, the predicted height at a tidal station is modified by using the results of a dynamic storm surge model (Entel et al 2005). This is then used with a dependent rating to predict the height at a station on the lower Yarra River in Melbourne for a storm in February 2005. Using the storm surge model improves the height prediction in this case. The forecast error was reduced from an original -0.5 metres to 0.1 metres.

Each catchment will have its unique response which is dependent on its own characteristics and the temporal and spatial distribution of the oncoming rainfall event. A non linear optimization technique has been applied to historical data for rainfall and river flows of the Kakanui catchment in North Otago, New Zealand, to estimate the parameters of a model based on the transfer function concept. The non linear optimization is based on Powell algorithm. Powell algorithm has been widely used in the literature, and it is more efficient and faster than the Simplex method (Press et al., 1989) Observed rainfall events at two locations in the Kakanui catchment, along with the corresponding observed flows of the river have been utilized to estimate the transfer function which represents the response of the Kakanui catchment to rainfall events. An adjusted form of Philip's equation for infiltration was used to estimate the abstraction of the rainfall event and obtain the effective rainfall which will contribute to the river flow. Weighing factors were assigned to each of the rainfall sites to obtain the best fit between observed and forecasted flows. Nine flood events were used for the calibration process, while two events were utilized for the validation of the derived model. The model has 19 parameters for the transfer function, 2 parameters for the hydrologic abstractions model, and 2 parameters for the weighing factors of the rainfall sites. This results in a total of 23 parameters for the developed model. The ratio of observed cumulative rainfall at Clifton Falls to the corresponding rainfall at the Dasher for historical events is not consistent, and varies significantly from one event to another. This indicates the high variability of the spatial distribution of rainfall events over the Kakanui catchment. As these rainfall events were used in the model calibration, it was difficult to obtain the correct transfer function without proper accounting for the spatial distribution of rainfall over the whole watershed. However, the model, in general, performed satisfactory, given the difficulty in representing the spatial variability of the rainfall events. The model was capable of simulating the flood hydrographs of several events which were incorporated in its calibration, but did not perform well with others. The model was able to simulate well the flows of a flood event which was not included in its calibration. Moreover, in applying the derived model for a real case event which occurred most recently on 30 July 2007, the model was able to forecast very closely the peak flow, but the whole flow hydrograph was not forecasted as good.",,,,"Kulasiri, Don/C-8789-2018","Kulasiri, Don/0000-0001-8744-1578",,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1782,1788,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030701122,,,,,

This is borne out of the fact that the processes involved in flood forecasting have inherent uncertainties in them. The procedure used in flood forecasting consists of a number of steps. The first step is rainfall measurement and forecasting rainfall during a flood event. The rainfall is then transformed into flow using a combined water balance and runoff-routing model. There are uncertainties associated with rainfall measurement/forecasting, model and flow measurements. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its derivatives are used widely in real time flow forecasting and it was decided to evaluate the performance of EnKF for Australian data. In an earlier study, three variations of EnKF were applied to the May 2003 flood event in Georges River in Sydney, Australia. In this study, four variations of EnKF were applied to four flood events in Gudgenby River in Canberra, Australia. The probability distributed moisture (PDM) model was used to transform the rainfall to discharge. The resulting discharge from the PDM model was updated using the EnKF. The four variations of EnKF considered in this study were the state updating, parameter updating, dual (state-parameter) and dual (parameter-state) updating. The performance of EnKF was evaluated using the root mean sqauare and the coefficient of efficiency for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12-h lead time forecasts. Also, the error in peak magnitude and peak timing error were also used in the comparison.

Here, the example of the Victorian electricity generating sector is used to show how physical Stocks and Flows Frameworks (SFF), implemented on the whatIf?(R) software platform, can be used to explore the broader physical implications of following different technological paths over the long term. The technological scenarios examined were chosen to yield different CO2 emission profiles for a given primary demand for electricity. Sub-scenarios dealing with different growth rates in primary demand for basic materials and energy per capita are also simulated. Comparisons between scenarios envisaging a major shift in generation technology (where 80% of electricity demand is met from a mix of combined cycle gas turbines, wind turbines, and biomass fired steam turbines), and scenarios where the current technological mix is continued into the future yield some interesting results when cross sectoral effects are taken into account. These include: 1. The degree to which a move to biomass could change electricity generation from modest water and minor land area consumer into a major indirect consumer of both. 2. The major spatial reconfiguration of the distribution grid required to include major contributions from biomass and wind turbines 3.

Researchers have, for so long, focused mainly on estimating returns and risk, and have assumed that the correlations are constant and have therefore paid less attention on them. However, recent studies uncover that such correlations vary over time. Therefore, modelling and forecasting future correlations between financial assets become a need. The paper fills the gap by forecasting conditional correlations between three classes of international financial assets, namely stock, bond and foreign exchange, considering the importance of those assets in portfolio construction. Diversification of portfolios across countries offers smaller correlations of expected returns than within a country for two reasons: (1) the economy and political environment evolve differently across countries, and (2) countries have different industries in their stock market indices (see Heston and Rouwenhost (1994)). Even though there is little evidence that either stock or bond markets have become more volatile worldwide, correlations appear to increase when market volatility increases (Odier and Solnik (1993)). As volatility spillovers and asymmetric effects of negative and positive shocks on conditional variance are evident to be the sources of volatilities in financial assets, it is imperative to investigate whether models that incorporate such specifications provide better conditional correlation forecasts. Two countries are considered, namely Australia and New Zealand. Both countries have strong economy relationship, hence return and volatility spillovers are expected to occur across both markets. In addition, both countries are of the same time zone. This avoids the problem of non-synchronous data. Forecasting will be conducted using three multivariate GARCH models, namely the Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) model of Bollerslev (1990), VARMA-GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003), and VARMA-AGARCH model of Chan et al. (2002). A rolling window is used to forecast 1-day ahead conditional correlations. To evaluate the impact of model specification on conditional correlation forecasts, this paper calculates and compares the correlations between conditional correlation forecasts. Forecasting correlations between stock, bond and foreign exchange have been undertaken by several papers using various models. Unlike most papers in literature that compare conditional forecasts with realized volatility in order to test the accuracy of such models, this paper is intended to analyze whether multivariate GARCH models incorporating volatility spillovers and asymmetric effect of negative and positive shocks on conditional variance provide better conditional correlation forecasts. The data used in this paper are the daily closing price index of stock, bond and foreign exchange rates from Australia and New Zealand. The stock indices are S&P ASX 200 Price Index and NZX ALL Price Index, while the bond indices are AU Benchmark 10 Year Govt. Index and NZ Benchmark 10 Year Govt. Index. Both foreign exchange rates are against US dollar. With stock, bond, and foreign exchange rates of both countries, there are 6 series of assets to be analyzed.

The paper aims to find out whether incorporating volatility spillovers in the model provides better VaR forecast. This is investigated by estimating the BEKK model of Engle and Kroner (1995). The paper also aims to find out whether considering conditional correlation is important in achieving better VaR forecast. This is investigated by estimating the DCC model of Engle (2002).

In terms of fresh water volume, the Amazon River is by far the world's biggest, and the biodiversity in the Amazon region is one of the world's richest. The total extension of the Amazon rain forest is about 7 million square kilometres, and is distributed across nine South American countries. Around 60% of the Amazon rain forest located in the Brazilian territory, which corresponds to virtually the entire North region of the country, is called the Brazilian Amazon, and defines the so-called Legal Amazon. The two biggest states of the Amazon region are Amazonas (the upper Amazon) and Para (the lower Amazon), which together account for around 73% of the Brazilian Legal Amazon, and are the only states that are serviced by international airports in Brazil's North region. Economic progress has been achieved at a cost of destroying large areas of the Amazon rain forest. In this scenario, the tourism industry would seem to have the potential to contribute to sustainable economic development in the North region of Brazil. The primary purpose of this paper is to model and forecast sustainable international tourism demand for the Brazilian Amazon. International tourist arrivals data are analysed for Amazonas and Para, which are also the only two states in the Brazilian Amazon for which monthly time series data over an extended period are available. The paper discusses the monthly and annual international tourist arrivals to Amazonas, Para and the total of the two states, presents unit root tests for the monthly and annual data, estimates alternative time series models and conditional volatility models of the shocks to international tourist arrivals, and provides forecasts of monthly and annual international tourist arrivals to Amazonas, Para and the total of the two states for 2006 and 2007. The estimated models indicated that the persistence of shocks to international tourist arrivals was present in both the short and long run. As the second and fourth moment restrictions are satisfied for Amazonas and the total of Amazonas and Para, the quasi maximum likelihood estimates were shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, so that standard statistical tests were valid. As in the case of the relatively low international tourism arrivals to the Brazilian Amazon for the 1971-2005 sample period for Amazonas and Para, the forecasts of international tourism arrivals for 2006 and 2007 also suggested that the forecasted international tourism arrivals to the Brazilian Amazon were likely to be very small. These observations point to the need for a much wider development of the sustainable tourist industry in the Amazon rain forest region.",,,,"Divino, Jose Angelo/C-3436-2013; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019",,,,,,0,0,0,3,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1899,1905,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030701139,,,,,

Most notably, these include the attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001, Bali Bombings, the Second Gulf War, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, shocks to oil price, among many others. Against this back drop, the worldwide tourism industry has been growing. This is a very promising forecast for the industry and should be taken seriously. This paper focuses on tourism destination countries, which give strong emphasis to the sustainability of their tourism industries, particularly the Maldives. Shareef (2004) classifies such countries as Small Island Tourism Economies (SITEs). The main attributes of these economies are as follows. SITEs are sovereign island economies, surrounded by the tranquil ocean with white, unspoilt sandy beaches, where tourists travel by air and sea. These economies overwhelmingly depend on earnings from international tourism for foreign exchange to engage in international trade, expanding civilian infrastructure for sustainable development, improvement in healthcare and advancement of educational facilities and many others. [GRAPHICS] As can be seen in Figure 1, since 1994 international tourist arrivals to the Maldives has been growing rapidly with a strong linear trend. Tourist arrivals are highly seasonal with the peak tourist season being the European winter months from December to March. Furthermore, the deseasonalized monthly tourist arrivals given in Figure 2 displays the adverse impact of the events on 11 September 2001 in New York City and the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004. This paper addresses impact of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on international tourism demand and its macroeconomic policy implications for the Maldives. An assessment of the economic impact of the tsunami on inbound international tourism demand is particularly important to the Maldives due to 2 main reasons. First, the large proportion of the Maldivian economy is dependent on international tourism and any adverse shock to the Maldivian tourism industry would affect the economy as a whole. Second, of all the countries in the Indian Ocean region that were affected by the by the tsunami, Maldives was the only country that was entirely hit by this devastating environmental calamity affecting the whole population and civilian infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,8,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1927,1933,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030701143,,,,,

To meet the need for accurate instruments to support decision-making, both scale and resolution of models have grown enormously during last years. Within the recent project 'Development of a Methodology for Interactive Planning for Water Management' (MIPWA) the challenge was taken to develop a high-resolution numerical groundwater model for the whole north of the Netherlands. This MODFLOW model encompasses an area of more than 24.000 km(2), has seven quasi-3D model layers and a resolution of 25 x 25 m(2). With this enormous groundwater model - which is unique in its size - 13 years of daily groundwater fluctuations had to be simulated. Both running and calibrating such a large model require innovations in model building, model processing and data handling. Data-compression techniques were required to store all input and output data. To run the model, both upscaling and model-decomposition techniques were develoved. For a transient run (over 4500 time steps) on the highest resolution, the model was decomposed into 473 overlapping submodels. Transient boundary conditions of the submodels were taken from a lower-resolution model. Each submodel could be run individually, so the process was perfectly suited for parallel processing. Therefore, we developed a computational grid using the 200 computers available in our office. The moment employees logged off, their computer came available for the grid. Obviously the weekends appeared to be the most productive days! The grid was also crucial for model calibration. We used the Representer method for calibrating model parameters in a stationary mode. The Representer method requires a forward run and an adjoint run each iteration to calculate the so-called representer of each observation. In total more than 8000 groundwater observation locations were available and hence more than 8000 runs had to be carried out. Each representer run was distributed over the grid using PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine). Grid computing revealed itself as the only way to complete the whole project within reasonable time. Total CPU time of model calibration and running (ca. 50 runs during model-construction process) was estimated at more than 20 years. Using grid computing, the calculation time was reduced to several months. In addition to model calibration and model running, grid computing is also helpful in data-assimilation applications. In a preliminary study, Ensemble Kalman Filtering techniques were applied for nowcasting and forecasting of groundwater fluctuations using assimilated groundwater. Model states were estimated by calculating 200 ensembles distributed over the grid. Subsequently, 10-day forecasts of groundwater levels were calculated by processing 50 ensembles of the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) calculated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. As the intention is to produce forecasts on daily basis, a computational grid is necessary to run all ensembles within one day.",,,,,"Berendrecht, Wilbert/0000-0002-7574-0308",,,,,1,1,0,1,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1954,1958,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030702001,,,,,

Their use has posed some discomfort among some of the users of traditional models in that there is no explanation of the underlying actual hydro-meteorological processes that contribute to the modelled phenomena. This paper intends to present the outcome of a study conducted using the data of a stream in New Zealand to illustrate that the hidden neurons in an ANN modelling tool, indeed, do have roles to play in representing the various processes involved in the hydrological phenomenon. It sheds light on the role of the hidden neurons in a Radial Basis Function (RBF) type ANN used to forecast the streamflows using the antecedent daily flow data. It is shown that (a) the modeller can determine the level to which the hydrograph is decomposed and, therefore, the complexity of the neural network, (b) each node in the hidden layer of neurons plays a role in reconstructing the hydrograph from its components, and that (c) the contributions from the hidden layer neurons are representative of the components that make up the flow hydrograph both quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, it is difficult to measure ET directly, and in most applications ET is estimated using models. Remotely sensed (RS) data provide an opportunity for estimating spatially distributed ET (ETRS) directly. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data are commonly with ET models to estimate ETRS, because of its high radiometric sensitivity, high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution, and it is free of charge. ETRS is usually validated at point locations against micro-meteorological measurements, such as Bowen-ratio energy balance and eddy-covariance system. These point validation can evaluate the temporal variation of ET, but cannot assess the spatial pattern of ET. A few attempts have been made to validate ETRS against catchment scale ET estimates based on water balance (Bastiaanssen et al. 2005). However, the validation is carried out in 1-2 catchments in a period of 1 year. This study assesses mean annual ETRS estimates against water balance estimates at 76 catchments in Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in the periods of 2001-05. The ETRS is estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation combined with a new surface conductance model for 1 x 1 km(2) grids across the MDB. The inputs to the model are mainly MODIS leaf area index and land classification data and gridded meteorological data. In this study, the five parameters in the surface conductance model are calibrated, separately for three climatic regions (humid, semi-arid and arid). The results indicate that the MODIS-based Penman-Monteith approach used here can satisfactorily estimate catchment scale ET. The results also suggest that the approach can reasonably estimate catchment runoff. This is particularly interesting because the approach is relatively simple and can provide spatial coverage of ET (and runoff) across entire regions of interest (e.. g, entire Murray-Darling Basin or Australia). It is likely that the approach used here and other remote sensing based ET methods can be used together with rainfall-runoff models (either to constrain rainfall-runoff model estimates or to improve rainfall-runoff model calibration, parameterization and regionalisation) to improve runoff predictions in ungauged catchments.",,,,"Cleugh, Helen/B-3591-2014; YONGQIANG, ZHANG/C-5708-2008; Zhang, Lu/B-8863-2009","YONGQIANG, ZHANG/0000-0002-3562-2323; Zhang, Lu/0000-0002-0442-5730",,,,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,2639,2644,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030702100,,,,,

An improvement in country risk ratings, or country creditworthiness, will lower a country's cost of borrowing and debt servicing obligations, and vice-versa. In this context, it is useful to analyse country risk ratings data, much like financial data, in terms of the time series patterns, as such an analysis would provide policy makers and the industry stakeholders with a more accurate method of forecasting future changes in the risks and returns of country risk ratings. Hoti and McAleer (2005a) used various univariate and multivariate conditional volatility models to analyse the dynamics of the conditional volatility associated with country risk returns for 120 countries across eight geographical regions. This extensive analysis classified the countries according the persistence of shocks to risk returns and the correlation coefficients of the conditional shocks to risk returns. Similarly, Hoti (2005a) provided an analysis of economic, financial, political and composite risk ratings using univariate and multivariate volatility models for nine Eastern European countries. The empirical results enabled a comparative assessment of the conditional means and volatilities associated with country risk returns, defined as the rate of change in country risk ratings, across the countries. Moreover the estimated constant conditional correlation coefficients provided useful information as to whether these countries are similar in terms of shocks to the four risk returns. Hoti and McAleer (2005b) estimated and tested the constant conditional correlation asymmetric VARMA-GARCH models for four countries. The paper analysed the conditional means and volatilities of economic, financial, political and composite risk returns and evaluated the multivariate spillover effects of the four risk returns for a country. Indeed, significant multivariate spillover effects were found in the rate of change of country risk ratings (or risk returns) across economic, financial, political and composite risk returns. Moreover, Hoti (2005b) was the first attempt to model spillover effects for risk returns across different countries. The paper provided a novel analysis of four risk returns using multivariate conditional volatility models for six countries situated in the Balkan Peninsula. The empirical results showed that these models are able to capture the existence of country spillover effects in the country risk returns. The purpose of this paper is to adapt the popular Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach in forecasting the conditional variance and Country Risk Bounds (CRBs) for the rate of change of risk ratings for ten representative countries. This paper demonstrates how this approach can be used not only by the countries wishing to attract foreign investments (or borrowing money), but also by the parties considering making such investments (or loans). Empirical results suggest that the country risk ratings of Switzerland, Japan and Australia are much more likely to remain close to current levels than the country risk ratings of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. This type of analysis would be useful to lenders/investors in evaluating the attractiveness of lending/investing in alternative countries. The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 1 describes country risk and country risk ratings. Section 2 extends the traditional VaR framework and introduces a new risk measure called Country Risk Bounds that is more useful in analysing country risk ratings. The models used are discussed in Section 3 while the data is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the forecasting exercise and discusses the policy implications. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in Section 6",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,2686,2692,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,,WOS:000290030702107,,,,,

The impact of telecommuting including the change of commuting trips as well as non-commuting trips are estimated in term of network vehicle-km saved. The model to calculate the reduction of commuting trips is explained using a concept diagram and mathematical expressions. A formulation is developed to form the model specific to examine impacts on vehicle-km travelled. A classification of telecommuting into full-day and part-day telecommuting is proposed to allow the systematic evaluation of impacts of the full or part substitution of journeys to work with arrangements to work at alternative locations. The proposed model accounts for a range of variables including employment, telecommuting proportion, telecommuting frequency, transport mode split and a number of transport network performance measures. Travel pattern adjustments of commuters when telecommuting arrangements introduced are also quantified in the model. The growth of telecommuting is simulated using the Logistic function of the technological substitution. The model has been calibrated from aggregate results of previous telecommuting studies. The model aims to enable the simulation of transport scenarios under different employment attendance arrangements to assist decisions related to allocation of funds and resources to promote telecommuting. Furthermore, the estimation of vehicle-km travelled allows evaluation of impacts on fuel consumption and related environmental analysis. The main focus of this research work has been to develop a forecasting methodology using data available from published sources. Four scenarios for New South Wales have been analysed and presented in the paper to illustrate background concepts, relative magnitude of variables and the application of the model.

As the occurrence and intensity of flooding are predicted to change dramatically as a result of climate change, predicting the consequences of such changes has become a major task for community ecology. Here we present abundance data of five species that comprise a species-poor community of high conservation value at lakeshores of Lake Constance over 17 years, during which one of the longest flood periods and the lowest water levels since 1890 occurred. We used simple regression models and increasingly sophisticated Markov chain models plus non-linear parameter estimation to put down abundance changes to direct effects of flooding on population-dynamic parameters and to indirect effects of flooding through modification of interspecific competition. We found a negative effect of flood duration on abundance changes for the non-specialist species Agrostis stolonifera and Phalaris arundinacea, but no effect on Carex acuta. The specialist species, Ranunculus reptans but not Littorella uniflora showed a positive effect of flooding. Data analysis revealed an unambiguous competitive hierarchy with the two graminoid species (C acuta, P. arundinacea) being superior, and the habitat specialists being most sensitive to interspecific competition. We used estimated parameters to project the community dynamics under different flooding regimes. Long-term projection showed that the original community is threatened by two non-specialist species (C acuta and P. arundinacea). Even if this forecast was influenced by various model limitations, it may indicate irreversible changes in soil fertility during the phase of high eutrophication between 1950 and 1980. Our study demonstrated that long-term abundance releves combined with Markov modelling and predictive simulations are an important counterpart to detailed short-term studies. The combination of empirical and theoretical methods elucidates the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors in community change. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

In addition, many constituencies are looking to managed ecosystems to sequester carbon in plant biomass and soil C to reduce the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on climate. This work builds on a 90-year-old grazing experiment in mountain meadows on the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of 90 years of protection from grazing on processes controlling the input, output, and storage of C in subalpine rangelands. Long-term grazing significantly reduced maximum biomass in all years compared with plots within grazing exclosures. For grazed plots, interannual variability in aboveground biomass was correlated with July precipitation and temperature (R-2 = 0.51), while there was a weak correlation between July precipitation and biomass in ungrazed plots (R-2 = 0.24). Livestock grazing had no statistically significant impacts on total soil C or particulate organic matter (POM), although grazing did increase active soil C and decrease soil moisture. Grazing significantly increased the proportion of total soil C pools that were potentially mineralizable in the laboratory, with soils from grazed plots evolving 4.6% of total soil C in 1 year while ungrazed plots lost 3.3% of total soil C. Volumetric soil moisture was consistently higher in ungrazed plots than grazed plots. The changes in soil C chemistry may have implications for how these ecosystems will respond to forecast climate change. Because grazing has resulted in an accumulation of easily decomposable organic material, if temperatures warm and summer precipitation increases as is anticipated, these soils may become net sources Of CO2 to the atmosphere creating a positive feedback between climate change and atmospheric CO2.",,,,,,,,,,27,29,1,35,,,,1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

The objective of this paper is to have a flood forecast model that utilises these great benefits and gives reliable accuracy. Another asset of a flood forecast model is a conceptual-distributed runoff model; it has been chosen because of its simplicity. Calibration and validation of the model has been met by good agreement for events in 2002 in the case of a 237 km(2) operational scale basin. These results are based on input Grid Point Value (GPV) precipitation of Japan radar observation. Forecasted Precipitation was based on a GPV Mesoscale Model of Japan NWP. It had an 18 hour lead time and updated four times a day. Flood forecasting based on input from forecasted precipitation shows that the accuracy decreases as lead-time increased. It is clear that flood forecasting depends on precipitation forecast accuracy. Observed precipitation and discharge are used for model updating to determine initial data for flood forecasting. The simplicity of the runoff model gives advantage on water content estimation in soil storage. It is necessary because the runoff model might have basic errors and it needs to have better initial data. Updating calculated discharge with observed discharge approximates the estimation.

However, due to the non-uniformity of alluvial channel bed and bank materials and the complex nature of the flu id-sediment-structure interactions and sediment transport processes, the calculated maximum scour depth for a given flow condition is normally regarded as being approximate, at best. This study investigates the nature of local scouring formed by vortices that are generated behind partially submerged river bed features having slanted ridges, and behind the ridges of scour holes. Modified theoretical relations developed for local scouring are compared with the results of experiments performed in laboratory channels having both rigid and moveable (test-bed) sections. At selected intermediate stages of the bed-scouring process, maximum velocities and turbulence intensities were measured at the bottom of developing scour holes. Two mathematical models for forecasting rearrangement of the river bed in a zone of local deformations are used. One considers scouring in beds composed of relatively homogeneous small sand particles, while the other is appropriate for channel beds comprised of non-homogeneous materials.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,1746-448X,,978-1-84564-075-0,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,,,2007,104,,,,,,381,387,,,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ecology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences",,,WOS:000248200500036,,,,,

Existing planning methods have proved to be extremely complex for use by regional agencies' untrained staff, which results in the inability of planning organizations to systematically assess the implications of their planning decisions. It has been proposed that Knowledge Based Systems (KBS) can be used as a tool to improve planning practice by allowing untrained agency personnel to make effective use of complex planning methods. In this paper, we explore the role of KBS in assisting agency staff who lack modeling experience to make effective use of a sophisticated land use model. The hypothesis is that KBS can help us increase the usability of urban models by replicating the decision making process performed by land use model experts; increased usability will, in turn, increase their applicability in planning practice. The Transportation Economic and Land Use model (TELUM) was the software developed to demonstrate how KBS can refine existing land use models and create easy and simple to use planning support systems.

Scenario analysis combined with landscape sciences can be used to characterize uncertainties, test possible impacts and evaluate responses, assist strategic planning and policy formulation, and structure current knowledge to scope the range of potential future conditions. In this study, potential impacts from three wide-ranging scenarios in a large regional area in the northwest United States are compared to current conditions (ca. 1990) of the region in terms of a set of processes that are modeled in a geographic information system (GIS). This study presents an integrated approach to identify areas with potential water quality problems as a result of land cover change projected by stakeholders within the basin. Landscape metrics in conjunction with hydrological process models were used to examine the contribution of land use/land cover to water and sediment yield and identify subwatersheds within the Willamette River Basin (Oregon, USA) that would be most affected in the year 2050 relative to three possible future scenarios which include inherent differences related to conservation, planning, and open development. Specifically, this study provides one example of the use of landscape sciences for environmental assessment that examines the impact of both urban and agricultural development in a large river basin. In particular, it attempts to (1) answer questions that relate to future scenarios that describe contrary positions related to urban development, (2) provide information which can be used to assess the potential changes of the landscape relative to human use, and (3) provide options that could be useful for sustainable management of natural resources and thus minimize future hydrologic and environmental impacts.",,,,,,,,,,7,7,1,7,,,,1871-4668,,978-1-4020-6594-1,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,NATO Sci.

Yet, their invasion is incipient and provides the rationale for identifying ecosystems likely to be invaded and where management and prevention efforts should be focused. To predict smelt presence and absence, we constructed a classification-tree model based on habitat data from 354 lakes in the native range for smelt in southern Maine. Maximum lake depth, lake area, and Secchi depth (surrogate measure of lake productivity) were the most important predictors. We then used our model to identify lakes vulnerable to invasion in three regions outside the smelt's native range: northern Maine (52 of 244 takes in the non-native range), Ontario (444 7 of 8110), and Wisconsin (553 of 5164). We further identified a subset of lakes with a strong potential for impact (potential-impact lakes) based on the presence of fish species that are affected by rainbow smelt. Ninety-four percent of vulnerable lakes in the non-native range in Maine are also potential-impact lakes, as are 94% and 58% of Ontario and Wisconsin's vulnerable lakes, respectively.

We assessed cover changes since 1961 in each landscape and surveyed patches for Chucao Tapaculo occupancy. We then developed incidence-based predictive models independently for each landscape and tested each model reciprocally in the alternative study area. We thereby assessed the domain of model applicability and identified those predictor variables with general effects and those that varied between the two landscapes. The two models were consistent regarding variable selection, and predictive accuracy of each model was high in the landscape where training data were collected. However, the models differed substantially in the magnitudes of effects related to patch size, with larger unoccupied patches observed in the landscape with the more advanced stage of fragmentation. Due to this discrepancy, each model performed poorly when applied to the alternative landscape, potentially reflecting the contrasting stages of habitat loss. Although it was impossible to dissociate effects of level and duration of forest loss, we viewed the landscapes as representing two extremes along a continuum of fragmentation, providing insights into potential trajectories for portions of the biome where deforestation is occurring. Further, our data suggest that static equilibrium models developed from distribution patterns in recently fragmented landscapes may overestimate persistence when used as a forecasting tool, or when extrapolated to alternative landscapes where fragmentation is more advanced. Thus, we suggest that landscapes used as standards for model building should be selected with caution. We recommend that distribution patterns be obtained from landscapes where fragmentation is advanced, preferably with histories of fragmentation long enough that time-delayed extinctions already would have occurred.",,,,"Sieving, Kathyrn E/I-6058-2013","Sieving, Kathyrn E/0000-0002-0849-8101",,,,,30,34,0,23,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

One thing we know for sure is that climate change is happening and the planet is getting warmer. Twelve of warmest years have occurred in the 1900's, 10 having occurred between 1987 and 1998. The top 300 metres of the sea surface temperature has increased, which may have catastrophic consequences for the planet if the conveyer belt system is changed or halted. With increased terrestrial temperatures diseases are now migrating into regions that they were not found in before. Evidence suggests that with the increased heating of the planet, energy availability will increase to drive extreme weather events, which could have a ripple effect throughout the Earth system with local, regional and global positive feedbacks feeding on each other, amplifying and accelerating warming.

This results in initial errors, which may impact on the cyclone track forecast. A solution to the above is to remove the weak initial vortex and replace it with a synthetic vortex (with the correct size, intensity and location) in the initial analysis. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of introducing a synthetic vortex (based on the NCAR-AFWA scheme) using the regional model MM5 on a tropical cyclone, which formed over the Bay of Bengal during November 2002. It is found that inclusion of the synthetic vortex has caused improvement in the simulation of wind asymmetries and warm temperature anomalies. The central minimum pressure and the maximum wind speed of the simulations with synthetic vortex are lower by 12 hPa and higher by 12 m sec(-1) as compared to the simulations without the synthetic vortex. Also, this has resulted in a considerable reduction of the track prediction errors: 168 km in 06 hours, 109 km in 12 hours, 332 km in 18 hours, 601 km in 24 hours and 126 km in 30 hours of forecast.

In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence-absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. 2. In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. 3. The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. 4. When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence-absence maps.",,,,"Lourenco, Carla R./M-3661-2013; Tsoar, Asaf/K-1374-2017","Lourenco, Carla R./0000-0002-6837-0986; Tsoar, Asaf/0000-0001-5572-7870",,,,,1580,1626,25,264,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Wildlife existing within the confines of fragmented reserves are particularly susceptible to fatalities on roads, especially those situated within urban and semirural matrices. The sustainability of many wildlife populations within reserve fragments are tenuous as roads further subdivide reserved areas and increase the frequency of animal-vehicle contact. Although many studies have assessed the quantity and diversity of fatalities from collisions, few studies have examined the long-term viability of wildlife populations living adjacent to roads. We chose to examine the effects of disturbances, including fatalities on roads, on a population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) within the Royal National Park on the urban fringe of Sydney, Australia. Despite having an extensive range, researchers suspect that many local populations of this sole member of Wallabia are in decline. We used a combination of population modeling and sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of disturbances on the population. Under current conditions, the forecast of the population was to decline over the next 100 years with the possibility of becoming extinct. We found that female reproduction and breeding were most influential on the population model. Of the range of management options investigated, by far the most rewarding was the reduction of fatalities on roads, as only a 20% decrease in female fatalities on roads has the potential to reverse the current decline and represents the best option for maintaining long-term viability. We suggest that documentation and subsequent management of road impacts, within the context of other threats, is essential to the conservation of similar species in road-affected environments.",,,,"Ramp, Daniel/C-3692-2008","Ramp, Daniel/0000-0003-3202-9898",,,,,31,36,3,46,,,,0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Juvenile and adult grouse were counted in the bag of harvested willow grouse in late August and throughout September at six sites in Sweden and Norway. In addition, numbers of juvenile and adult willow grouse were obtained from line-transect counts at 21 sites in Sweden just before the hunting season started on 25 August. The juvenile: adult ratio from the harvest data, estimated as number of juveniles per two adults, showed sin-filar long-term averages and distributions between all six sites. The results from the line-transect counts revealed an overall higher average and a greater range of production between sites. We suggest that the difference between estimates based on line-transect counts and harvest data are caused by hunter behaviour. Hunters did not sample the juvenile and adult grouse in proportion to what was present in the population, e.g., productivity estimates derived from harvest samples will underestimate the proportion of juveniles in autumn in most years. We suggest that it is the harvest process that acts to adjust the juvenile to old bird ratio in the harvest data to a similar distribution in different sites. We found little evidence of regular fluctuations/cycles in annual production of juveniles from either harvest data or line-transect data. We conclude that chick production in willow grouse appears to fluctuate more irregularly than was previously believed based on harvest data and can not be used as a potential forecasting tool in willow grouse management as suggested earlier. Spatial correlation was weak and investigating only a limited number of sites to predict the proportion of juveniles in autumn should not be considered as a management tool for large areas such as the state-owned land in Sweden. Line-transect counts are costly, but do provide a more accurate estimate of the proportion of juveniles in the fall population than is revealed by harvest data. A more detailed understanding of hunter behaviour is obviously needed for better interpretation of harvest data.",,,,,,,,,,17,17,0,36,,,,0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,DEC,2006,12,4,,,,,347,355,,10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[347:TASCIC]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology; Zoology,,,WOS:000243032400002,,,,,

Quantitative and qualitative data on climate, land-use, fire history and ecosystem dynamics were used to construct a chronology of processes threatening terrestrial mammal species. Over the last 150 years there has been the transition in land tenure from a hunter-gatherer economy to pastoralism, the loss of 11 mammal species, the cessation of small scale burning by Aboriginal people and the introduction of the fox and cat. Annual rainfall was highly variable and was influenced by the phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Irruptions of rodents, marked increases in the populations of native and introduced predators and extensive wildfires were associated with the La Nina phase of ENSO and occurred when rain-year (July-June) rainfall approached or exceeded the 90th percentile of the historical rainfall distribution. Large rainfall events in and Australia have been viewed traditionally as the 'boom' times that benefit wildlife and pastoral production. However, because of hyper-predation and the risk of wildfire, we show that the years including and immediately following flooding rains should be identified as critical, or 'bust' periods for wildlife and conservation management. ENSO related climatic forecasts appear to be useful cues which can be incorporated into fire and predator management strategies in and Australia.

Using long-term (five years), high-frequency temperature records recorded at multiple sites, we tested the hypothesis that local ""modifying factors"" such as the timing of low tide in summer can lead to large-scale geographic mosaics of body temperature. Our results show that patterns of body temperature during aerial exposure at low tide vary in physiologically meaningful and often counterintuitive ways over large sections of this species' geographic range. We evaluated the spatial correlations among sites to explore how body temperatures change along the latitudinal gradient, and these analyses show that ""hot spots"" and ""cold spots"" exist where temperatures are hotter or colder than expected based on latitude. We identified four major hot spots and four cold spots along the entire geographic gradient with at least one hot spot and one cold spot in each of the three regions examined (Washington-Oregon, Central California, and Southern California). Temporal autocorrelation analysis of year-to-year consistency and temporal predictability in the mussel body temperatures revealed that southern animals experience higher levels of predictability in thermal signals than northern animals. We also explored the role of wave splash at a subset of sites and found that, while average daily temperature extremes varied between sites with different levels of wave splash, yearly extreme temperatures were often similar, as were patterns of predictability. Our results suggest that regional patterns of tidal regime and local pattern of wave splash can overwhelm those of large-scale climate in driving patterns of body temperature, leading to complex thermal mosaics of temperature rather than simple latitudinal gradients. A narrow focus on population changes only at range margins may overlook climatically forced local extinctions and other population changes at sites well within a species range.

However, these factors can be insufficient to explain spatial and temporal variation in grass cover for and and semiarid grasslands during an extreme drought that promotes woody plant encroachment. Transport of materials among patches may also be important to this variation. We used long-term cover data (19152001) combined with recently collected field data and spatial databases from a site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert to assess temporal trends in cover and the relative importance of factors at three scales (plant. patch, landscape unit) in explaining spatial variation in grass cover. We examined cover of five important grass species from two topographic positions before, during, and after the extreme drought of the 1950s. Our results show that dynamics before, during, and after the drought varied by species rather than by topographic position. Different factors were related to cover of each species in each time period. Factors at the landscape unit scale (rainfall, stocking rate) were related to grass cover in the pre- and post-drought periods whereas only the plant-scale factor of soil texture was significantly related to cover of two upland species during the drought. Patch-scale factors associated with the redistribution of water (microtopography) were important for different species in the pre- and post-drought period. Another patch-scale factor, distance from historic shrub populations, was important to the persistence of the dominant grass in uplands (Bouteloua eriopoda) through time. Our results suggest the importance of local processes during the drought, and transport processes before and after the drought with different relationships for different species. Disentangling the relative importance of factors at different spatial scales to spatial patterns and long-term trends in grass cover can provide new insights into the key processes driving these historic patterns, and can be used to improve forecasts of vegetation change in and and semiarid areas.",,,,,,,,,,44,46,0,24,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

We use this method to demonstrate a landscape wide expansion of closed forest (42% increase in total coverage) in the Australian monsoon tropics over the past five decades. Retrospective habitat suitability models (HSI) of closed forest derived using four landscape measures (drainage distance, slope angle, aspect and elevation) for imagery taken in 1947 correctly forecast the subsequent spatial distribution of the expansion, with topographic fire protection primarily determining the closed-forest distribution. The dynamics of the closed forest-savanna boundary were predicted accurately by generalised linear models, with closed-forest expansion in fire-protected sites along forest edges and regression in the more fire-prone areas. Two factors may plausibly explain the expansion of closed forests. First, eco-ethnographic records stress the skilful use of fire by Aboriginal people in protecting isolated and locally resource-rich closed-forest patches.

This study assessed the applicability of the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) forage growth model for both strategic (long-term) and tactical (within-season) prediction of forage production in northern mixed-grass prairie. An improved version of the model was calibrated for conditions at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Long-term (1983-2001) simulations of peak standing crop (PSC) were compared to observations. Also, within-season (1983) forecasts of total aboveground biomass made for 1. March onward, 1 April onward, 1 May onward, and 1 June onward were compared to observations. The normal, driest, and wettest weather years on record (1915-1981) were used to simulate expected values, lower bounds, and upper bounds of biomass production, respectively. The forage model explained 66% of the variability in PSC from 1983 to 2001. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) derived from long-term simulated PSC overestimates cumulative probabilities for PSC > 1 500 kg.ha(-1). The generated CDF could be used strategically to estimate long-term forage production at various levels of probability, with errors in cumulative probability ranging from 0.0 to 0.16. Within-season forecasts explained 77%-94% of biomass variability in 1983. It was shown that monthly updating of the forage forecast, with input of actual weather to date, improves accuracy.

Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model trained with original particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, named as MLP-PSO model in this study, can be used to achieve such task, but PSO algorithm tends to suffer from 'curse of dimensionality' and overfitting problem, when MLP architecture size becomes large. Such disadvantage inevitably degrades model's predictive performance. Instead of using a random swarm initializing strategy in the MLP-PSO, the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is employed to sample the weight matrix from the posterior probability distribution of MLP optimal weight matrix, and these sampled weight matrixes are then used to initialize ""eight matrix swarm"" in PSO before MLP training starts. The MLP-PSO with such new swarm initialization strategy can then be considered as a two-staged hybrid model. Such initial weight matrixes locate in more promising region in PSO search space and hence have better convergence rate and reliability to optimal weight matrix than those by the MLP-PSO with random initialization for analyzing the experiment results. Aforementioned problems encountered by MLP-PSO with random initialization are avoided by our hybrid model. Within our expectation, the experiment results of 1-day ahead forecasting for daily maximum O-3 level in two selected air monitoring sites show that hybrid model has better predictive performance not only in non-episodes but also in episodes.

Model systems such as SUNDIAL provide arable N fertiliser advice by modelling the N supply from soil, but poor knowledge of future weather reduces accuracy. A weather generator was used to produce sets of simulated weather of a range of accuracies and durations, for 10 regions in England and Wales. In a series of computer simulations, we tested the effect of prior knowledge of weather following the date of N fertiliser application on the efficiency of use of applications using SUNDIAL. The changes in N leaching, denitrification and crop N uptake due to the forecast quality were calculated. Yield and gross profit changes were estimated from N uptake, for the arable industry in England and Wales. Changes in losses were small. With a perfect forecast, there was a small decrease in leaching (approximately 1 kg N ha(-1)), and still less change in denitrification. The increase in crop uptake due to a perfect 27-week weather forecast was 6 kg N ha(-1) and the increase in farm profit in England and Wales amounted to 68 million pounds per annum. With more accurate forecasts, the system can reduce the risk of under-application of N. A perfect 3-week forecast would increase uptake by an average of 2 kg N ha(-1), and increase profit nationally by 23 million pounds per annum but have negligible impact on losses. These improvements appear to be systematic and could be expected to be achieved with any recommendation system that makes explicit use of post-application weather. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting geographical areas susceptible to weed invasion is a primary target for land managers. Willows (Salix spp.) invading riparian environments have recently been increasing in number in south-east Australia. In order to prioritize management decisions, a clear understanding of the factors affecting recruitment success for sexually and asexually generated Salix recruits is vital. 2. Multiple variables are hypothesized to determine the spatial distribution of Salix recruits. Therefore an information-theoretic model comparison (ITMC) approach was used to analyse factors determining the abundance and distribution of Salix recruits along four rivers in south-east Australia with differing flow regulation. Generalized linear modelling techniques were applied to multiparameter candidate models, developed from existing knowledge of the system and plausible hypotheses. Predictor variables included parameters describing river disturbance, availability of propagule sources and competition for recruitment space. 3. Models of sexually produced Salix recruits performed well, generating 95% confidence sets of candidate models that were small relative to the potential set of models analysed (18%), whereas models of asexual recruits performed less well, indicated by 95% confidence sets that were large relative to the potential set of models explored (67%). 4. A multimodel inference approach was required: model results indicated that availability of mating partners in the environment plays an important role in determining the abundance of sexually derived Salix recruits, whereas for asexual recruits river disturbance parameters better predicted abundance. 5. For the models of sexual reproduction, model plausibility was strengthened by corroborative results from an independent data set collected in the same geographical region. However, the validation data set was too small to assess the predictive capability of the model-averaged model. 6. Synthesis and applications. Information-theoretic model selection methods helped clarify the relative importance of different model parameters on the abundance of Salix recruits. Knowledge of the link between river regulation and willow recruitment enables a greater degree of management flexibility in response to risk forecasting under future scenarios for different water flows. Targeting control programmes to focus on removal of female and seeding willows in rivers with low levels of disturbance may eliminate Salix recruits altogether, whereas the same treatment applied to high-level disturbance rivers is likely to result in persistent problems with asexual recruits.",,,,"stokes, kate/C-1058-2009; Cunningham, Saul A/B-9947-2009; Stokes, Kate/B-8061-2014","Cunningham, Saul A/0000-0003-0703-6893; Stokes, Kate/0000-0002-2803-3002",,,,,20,21,0,28,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Potential impacts of climate warming are assessed by quantifying the magnitude and direction of modelled distributional shifts for every species. In particular we ask, first, what proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to lose and gain suitable climate space in the future? Secondly, do species projections vary according to taxonomic, spatial or environmental properties? And thirdly, what climate factors might be driving projections of loss or gain in suitable environments for species? Location Europe. Methods Distributions of species are modelled with four species -climate envelope techniques (artificial neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and classification tree analyses) and distributions are projected into the future using five climate-change scenarios for 2050. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have unlimited dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A novel hybrid approach for combining ensembles of forecasts is then used to group linearly covarying projections into clusters with reduced inter-model variability. Results We show that a great proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to expand distributions if dispersal is unlimited. This is because warming in the cooler northern ranges of species creates new opportunities for colonization. If species are unable to disperse, then most species are projected to lose range. Loss of suitable climate space for species is projected to occur mainly in the south-west of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula, whilst species in the south-east are projected to gain suitable climate. This is because dry conditions in the south-west are projected to increase, approaching the levels found in North Africa, where few amphibian species are able to persist. Main conclusions The impact of increasing temperatures on amphibian and reptile species may be less deleterious than previously postulated; indeed, climate cooling would be more deleterious for the persistence of amphibian and reptile species than warming. The ability of species to cope with climate warming may, however, be offset by projected decreases in the availability of water. This should be particularly true for amphibians. Limited dispersal ability may further increase the vulnerability of amphibians and reptiles to changes in climate.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Ingles, Candido J./C-5979-2011; Thuiller, Wilfried/AAI-1725-2019; THUILLER, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Araujo, Miguel/0000-0002-5107-7265; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; THUILLER, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274",,,,,508,540,9,323,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

This paper compares linear stochastic models (ARIMA/SARIMA), recursive multistep neural network (RMSNN) and direct multi-step neural network (DMSNN) for drought forecasting. The models were applied to forecast droughts using standardized precipitation index (SPI) series as drought index in the Kansabati River Basin, which lies in the Purulia district of West Bengal, India.

One of the most common problems is sparse data: we will have rarely sampled all areas for invaders and consequently do not know where all the invaded sites are. This is problematic because the entire system of sites determines invasion probability for any single site-unsampled sites can act as both sources and sinks of propagules. Thus, the difficulty is to predict invasions across the entire system with only sparse data. In this manuscript, we develop an approach to make use of partial data to forecast new invasions, and compare it with default ways of handling missing information in biological invasions. We demonstrate that it is possible to estimate spread with only a fraction of sites sampled. We find that reliability depends on the number of invaded sites sampled and that there is a tendency to underestimate the effect of propagule pressure when Allee effects are present.

The work was focused through a set of ecological management concerns of the region's military installations. As urbanization removes or degrades habitat, these large and largely un-built properties are increasingly important for the maintenance of regional biodiversity. Looking forward, stakeholders are asking how might growth affect the ""rules of engagement"" that allow the military to fulfill its mission and native species to continue to exist in the area? A set of scenarios describe possible interactions of macro-scale forces of change and commensurate regional responses; associated analyses locate and quantify the consequences. Each scenario presents unique potential challenges and the set captures a range of alternative management contexts. In examining what the future might become rather than what it should become, this approach provides a geographic vulnerability analysis that can help stakeholders assess the long-term success of pending local environmental plans and, thereby, make decisions that are more robust to uncertainties related to exogenous forces ofchange.

The results expand the documented range of Bythotrephes in Minnesota from Lake Superior, Island Lake, and Saganaga Lake to Flour Lake, Greenwood Lake, McFarland Lake, Pine Lake, and Caribou Lake as well as to Saganagons Lake in Ontario. The latter three lakes are located in roadless landscapes without motorized boat access. Results confirm that Bythotrephes is no longer present in Boulder Lake or Fish Lake (St. Louis County, Minnesota), providing the first evidence of range compression (extinction following introduction) of this species in North America. Distributional expansion was confined to a corridor along the international border between northeast Minnesota and Ontario. Lakes along the invasion corridor were deeper, more transparent, and had lower chlorophyll concentration, on average, compared to other lakes studied. The pattern of range expansion provided an opportunity to test the predictions of a forecasting model for Bythotrephes occurrence (MacIsaac et al. 2000 Archiv fur Hydrobiologie 149: 1-21) based on habitat characteristics. The model predicted 51% of the surveyed inland lakes to be susceptible to invasion, however, only 13% were actually invaded, implying strong dispersal constraints. Application of the forecasting model to a broader set of 179 Minnesota lakes predicted that 41% may be vulnerable to establishment by Bythotrephes based on habitat characteristics, offering an estimate of the state's overall lake susceptibility (i.e., fundamental niche) to invasion. The results of this study provide evidence for the importance of a low-light refuge where Bythotrephes can minimize vulnerability to fish predation as a key habitat feature not considered by the forecasting model.",,,,,,,,,,42,43,0,26,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

In this study, we quantified the conservation value, for forest bird species, of three degraded habitat types in Peninsular Malaysia, namely rubber tree plantations, oil palm plantations, and open areas. We surveyed these degraded habitats using point counts to estimate their forest bird species richness and abundance. We assessed whether richness, abundance, and activities of different avian dietary groups (i.e. insectivores and frugivores) varied among the habitats. We identified the critical habitat elements that accounted for the distribution of forest avifauna in these degraded habitats. Our results showed that these habitats harboured a moderate fraction of forest avifauna (approximately 46-76 species) and their functions were complementary (i.e. rubber tree plantations for moving; open habitats for perching; shrubs in oil palm plantations for foraging). In terms of species richness and abundance, rubber tree plantations were more important than oil palm plantations and open habitats. The relatively high species richness of this agricultural landscape was partly due to the contiguity of our study areas with extensive forest areas. Forecasts of forest-species presence under various canopy cover scenarios suggest that leaving isolated trees among non-arboreal crops could greatly attract relatively tolerant species that require tree canopy.

The strength of this relationship has been shown through the development of a deterministic model, based upon temperature and soil moisture conditions alone, which accurately describes the population dynamics and abundance of Deroceras reticulatum. Because of this strong climatic dependence, slug abundance and dynamics are likely to be affected by climate change. We used a validated individual-based model ( IbM) of D. reticulatum, to assess the effects of climate change on the abundance of this species in the UK. Climatic scenarios were based on the UKCIP02 predictions and constructed using the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator. The IbM of slugs predicted population dynamics at three time slices (2020s, 2050s and 2080s), and two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. The maximum generation number, the number of population peaks, the number of slug-days in each season, the percentage of years when the population passes over a threshold for damage and the percentage of years in which populations go extinct were investigated. Currently, the south-west of the UK has the best conditions for D. reticulatum to thrive, with the north-east of Scotland having the most adverse. By 2080 under both low- and high-emissions scenarios, the north and west of Scotland will have the most favourable conditions for the survival of this species and the east of the UK and Scotland will have the harshest. By 2080 the climate in the north-west of Scotland will become more like the current climate in southeast England, which explains the shift in the pattern of abundance.

This paper proposes a stochastic model for prediction of the emergence times of the moths, in order to aid treatment aimed at their control. Observed moth counts are treated as a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose probabilities are related to the distribution of time to emergence. We use a hierarchical model to account for the variability of this distribution between sites and years. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian fitting of the model to data are described, the latter using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, and the Bayesian approach is used for forecasting in future years. Grape vine moth flights proved much more variable than grape berry moth flights among sites and years; depending on the site, the flights of the two species can overlap or be completely distinct. Credibility intervals are provided for each site for a random future year, and the predictions can be updated and refined once 15-20% of the flight for a new year has emerged. The paper ends with discussion of the role of such models in similar applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,15,15,0,10,,,,0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The model was calibrated and validated against two years data from 2001 and 2002, respectively. Furthermore, the model was applied for examining the effects of an ongoing restoration project in the lake by testing three different prognosis scenarios: (1) aeration of the hypolimnion, (2) biomanipulation by removing the trash fish from the lake, (3) two processes described in the two scenarios were applied simultaneously. The calibration yielded acceptable results with a standard deviation (S.D.) of less than 45% for the phytoplankton abundance considered as the most important state variable in the model. The validation results were acceptable for the key state variable, phytoplankton abundance, compared to the observations. Thus, the model was applied to set up prognoses and the results from the prognoses showed that a major improvement in the water quality of the lake might be expected with a significant reduction in the phytoplankton abundance land in the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in 10 years as expected from the restoration project in the lake. Moreover, the model suggested that the combined application of biomanipulation and aeration practices described in Scenario 3 was the most effective among the three restoration scenarios tested, in obtaining a significant reduction in both phytoplankton abundance and the concentration of TP in the lake. The validation of prognoses is possible when data are available on the development of the lake's status at later stages of the restoration project and after. The lower confidence in data possibly resulted in the high discrepancy from the observations in the validation simulations for zooplankton, the peak values of cyanobacteria, and the timing of phytoplankton, zooplankton and cyanobacteria in the calibration and validation simulations. These have to be taken into account during evaluating the results from the model for the management of the lake. It is recommended that an improved predictive model based on the one presented in this paper is developed due to the explained limitations in the current model developed in this study. It is also suggested that such a model is incorporated into monitoring of the lake's status for a better-informed decision-making in the management of Lake Fure in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that (1) construction and demolition flows follow a cyclical behaviour, (2) the cycles of construction and demolition flows are phase displaced in the first half of the 21st century, with decreasing construction and increasing demolition, and (3) growth of the dwelling stock is becoming increasingly more material intensive as a growing amount of material is used for replacements. The presented stock dynamics approach can principally be applied for any anthropogenic material stock; however, it is most useful for the examination of metabolic consequences of diffusion processes of durable and fixed capital stocks.

We demonstrate the utility of combining species occurrence models with land-use change models to identify areas where future development may differentially affect wildlife. Occurrence data for native (e.g., gray fox, coyote, bobcat, mountain lion, striped skunk, raccoon) and non-native (e.g., domestic dogs, domestic cats, opossums) mammalian predators were collected from 188 remotely triggered camera locations across an oak woodland and vineyard landscape in northern California. The occurrence data were used in combination with landscape variables extracted using a geographic information system to build explanatory models of predator occurrence. These statistical models were used to derive two surfaces showing relative probability of occurrence for non-native and native predators. Then, a spatially explicit land-use change model was used to examine potential future predator distributions given potential future vineyard expansion. The probability distribution models generated hypothesized low probabilities of occurrence for native predators within large vineyard blocks, but higher probabilities within isolated vineyards and also in oak woodlands. The models suggest the highest probabilities of non-native predator occurrence fell within large blocks of vineyard. Using one possible future vineyard development scenario, the distribution models illustrate areas where probability of native predator occurrence may be reduced and where non-native predators may expand due to vineyard development. This technique could be applied to prioritize acquisition of critical wildlife habitat and maintain habitat connectivity for wildlife populations.",,,,,,,,,,19,21,0,61,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

How many species, and which species, can persist in such landscapes (and analogous seascapes) are open questions. Here we explore two complementary theoretical frameworks to address these questions: species-area relationships and demographic models. We use the terrestrial mammal fauna of Central America to illustrate the application of both frameworks. We begin by proposing a multi-habitat species-area relationship, the countryside species-area relationship, to forecast species extinction rates. To apply it, we classify the mammal fauna by affinity to native and human-dominated habitats. We show how considering the conservation value of countryside habitats changes estimates derived from the classic species-area approach We also examine how the z value of the species-area relationship affects extinction estimates. Next, we present a framework for assessing the relative vulnerability of species to extinction in the countryside, based on the Skellam model of population dynamics. This model predicts the minimum area of contiguous native habitat required for persistence of a species, which we use as an indicator of vulnerability to habitat change. To apply the model, we use our habitat affinity classification of mammals and we estimate life-history parameters by species and habitat type. The resulting ranking of vulnerabilities is significantly correlated with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List assessment.",,,,"Pereira, Henrique Miguel/B-3975-2009","Pereira, Henrique Miguel/0000-0003-1043-1675",,,,,127,133,4,73,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2006,87,8,,,,,1877,1885,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1877:MBDICL]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000239833400002,16937624,,,,

It might be possible to predict changes in the richness of inadequately investigated groups from that of groups for which enough information is available. Here we evaluate the reliability of this approach by reviewing 237 richness correlations extracted from the recent literature. Of the 43 taxa covered, beetles, vascular plants, butterflies, birds, ants, and mammals (in that order) were the most common ones examined. Forests and grasslands strongly dominated the ecosystem types studied. The variance explanation (R-2) could be calculated for 152 cases, but only 53 of these were significant. An average correlation effect size of 0.374 (95% CI = +/- 0.0678) indicates positive but weak correlations between taxa within the very heterogeneous data set. None of the examined explanatory variables (spatial scale, taxonomic distance, trophic position, biome) could account for this heterogeneity. However, studies focusing on 10-km(2) grid cells had the highest variance explanation. Moreover, within-phylum between-class comparisons had marginally significantly lower correlations than between-phylum comparisons. And finally, the explanatory power of studies conducted in the tropics was significantly higher than that of studies conducted in temperate regions. It is concluded that the potential of a correlative approach to species richness is strongly diminished by the overall low level of variance explanation. So far, no taxon has proved to be a universal or even particularly good predictor for the richness of other taxa. Some suggestions for future research are inclusion of several taxa in models aiming at regional richness predictions, improvement of knowledge on species correlations in human dominated systems, and a better understanding of mechanisms underlying richness correlations.",,,,"Zaitsev, Andrey/J-6874-2018; Wolters, Volkmar/B-4635-2010","Zaitsev, Andrey/0000-0001-8521-4304; ",,,,,148,155,2,76,,,,0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2006,87,8,,,,,1886,1895,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1886:RATSRO]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000239833400003,16937625,,,,

Fish richness increases logarithmically with discharge, an index of habitat space, similar to a species-area curve in terrestrial systems. We apply the species-discharge model as a forecasting tool to build scenarios of changes in riverine fish richness from climate change, water consumption, and other anthropogenic drivers that reduce river discharge. Using hypothetical reductions in discharges (of magnitudes that have been observed in other rivers), we predict that reductions of 20-90% in discharge would result in losses of 2-38% of the fish species in two biogeographical regions in the United States (Lower Ohio-Upper Mississippi and Southeastern). Additional data on the occurrence of specific species relative to specific discharge regimes suggests that fishes found exclusively in high discharge environments (e.g., Shovelnose sturgeon) would be most vulnerable to reductions in discharge. Lag times in species extinctions after discharge reduction provide a window of opportunity for conservation efforts. Applications of the species-discharge model can help prioritize such management efforts among species and rivers.",,,,"Goforth, Reuben/B-1646-2010","Goforth, Reuben/0000-0001-6891-3146",,,,,93,98,2,71,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2006,87,8,,,,,1907,1914,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1907:GWTFUS]2.0.CO;2,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000239833400005,16937627,,,,

We obtained monthly data on the counts of RRV cases, monthly total rainfall, human population size and mosquito density (i.e., average number of mosquitoes trapped in all mosquito monitoring stations per month) between 1 November 1998 and 31 December 2001 from the Queensland Department of Health, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Australia Bureau of Statistics and Brisbane City Council, respectively. Both polynomial distributed lag (PDL) time-series regression and seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were used to examine associations of RRV transmission with rainfall and mosquito density after adjustment for seasonality and auto-correlation. The results show that 85% and 95% of the variance in the RRV transmission was accounted for by rainfall and mosquito density, respectively. Both rainfall and mosquito density were strong predictors of the RRV transmission in simple models. However, multivariate PDL models show that only mosquito density at lags of 0 and 1 month was significantly associated with the transmission of RRV disease. The SARIMA models show similar results.

However, a wider array of natural and human factors may limit caribou persistence and isolate populations, and understanding these may help to stop or reverse population declines by forecasting risk and targeting core habitat areas and key linkages for protection, enhancement or restoration. Across most of the historic range of mountain caribou, we conducted a bi-level analysis to evaluate factors related to the persistence of, and landscape occupancy within, remaining subpopulations. We used caribou location data from 235 radio-collared animals across 13 subpopulations to derive a landscape occupancy index, while accounting for inherent sampling biases. We analyzed this index against 33 landscape variables of forest overstory, land cover, terrain, climate, and human influence. At the metapopulation level, the persistence of subpopulations relative to historic range was explained by the extent of wet and very wet climatic conditions, the distribution of both old (> 140 yr) forests, particularly of cedar and hemlock composition, and alpine areas. other important factors were remoteness from human presence, low road density and little motorized access. At the subpopulation level, the relative intensity of caribou landscape occupancy within subpopulation bounds was explained by the distribution of old cedar/hemlock and spruce/subalpine fir forests and the lack of deciduous forests. Other factors impeding population contiguity were icefields, non-forested alpine, hydro reservoirs, extensive road networks, and primary highway routes. Model outputs at both levels were combined to predict the potential for mountain caribou population persistence, isolation, and restoration. We combined this output with the original occupancy index to gauge the potential vulnerability of caribou to extirpation within landscapes known to have recently supported animals. We discuss implications as they pertain to range-wide caribou population connectivity and conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The ecological niche is a fundamental biological concept. Modelling species' niches is central to numerous ecological applications, including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species' ranges. 2. A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species' environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates. 3. We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence data and are comparable in empirical tests. 4. Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning, management and conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species' potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape alteration.",,,,"Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Randin, Christophe F/K-6969-2016; Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Randin, Christophe F/0000-0002-4171-0178; Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235",,,,,151,160,1,51,,,,0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The DJM population, a northern outpost of pinyon, was established by long-distance dispersal (similar to 40 km). Growth of this isolate was markedly episodic and tracked multidecadal variability in precipitation. Initial colonization occurred by AD 1246, but expansion was forestalled by catastrophic drought (1250-1288), which we speculate produced extensive mortality of Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteospemia (Torr.) Little), the dominant tree at DJM for the previous similar to 8700 years. Pinyon then quickly replaced juniper across DJM during a few wet decades (1330-1339 and 1368-1377). Such alternating decadal-scale droughts and pluvial events play a key role in structuring plant communities at the landscape to regional level.

We evaluated long term ANPP datasets from the Konza Prairie Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program (1984-1999) to determine if similar relationships could be identified based on patterns of natural variability (magnitude and timing) in precipitation. ANPP data were analyzed from annually burned sites in native mesic grassland and productivity was partitioned into graminoid (principally C-4 grasses) and forb (C-3 herbaceous) components. Although growing season precipitation amount was the best single predictor of total and grass ANPP (r(2)=0.62), several measures of precipitation variability were also significantly and positively correlated with productivity, independent of precipitation amount. These included soil moisture variability, expressed as CV, for June (r(2)=0.45) and the mean change in soil moisture between weekly sampling periods in June and August (%wv) (r(2)=0.27 and 0.32). In contrast, no significant relationships were found between forb productivity and any of the precipitation variables (p > 0.05). A multiple regression model combining precipitation amount and both measures of soil moisture variability substantially increased the fit with productivity (r(2)=0.82). These results were not entirely consistent with those of short-term manipulative experiments in the same grassland, however, because soil moisture variability was often positively, not negatively related to ANPP. Differences in results between long and short term experiments may be due to low variability in the historic precipitation record compared to that imposed experimentally as experimental levels of variability exceeded the natural variability of this dataset by a factor of two. Thus, forecasts of ecosystem responses to climate change (i.e. increased climatic variability), based on data constrained by natural and recent historical rainfall patterns may be inadequate for assessing climate change scenarios if precipitation variability in the future is expected to exceed current levels.",,,,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008","Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X",,,,,129,143,3,86,,,,1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAY,2006,184,1,,,,,65,74,,10.1007/s11258-005-9052-9,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,,,WOS:000238139000006,,,,,

This paper studies the potential use of ENSO-based climate forecasts to reduce N leaching without reducing profits on North Florida dairies. A model was created to perform the analyses, the Dynamic North Florida Dairy Farm Model (DyNoFlo). DyNoFlo is an integrated dynamic model that incorporates Markov-chain simulation of cow flows and crop model simulations for historical climatic years (El Ni (n) over tildeo, La Ni (n) over tildea, and Neutral years). It also includes optimization of managerial options. It responds to dairy-specific environment (climate and soils) and management (livestock management, waste management, crop systems management). The DyNoFlo model was designed to be a tool for producers, regulatory agencies, and extension services in addition to a research tool. Analyzing a typical North Florida dairy farm, it was found that N leaching was highest during winter El Ni (n) over tildeo years. Sandy soils were substantially more prone to leach N, and perennial grasses were better to prevent N leaching. The typical farm could decrease N leaching up to 23% in an El Ni (n) over tildeo year and still maintain profit by adjusting protein in the diet, confinement time for milking cows, and combining perennial grasses and forages in pastures and sprayfields. Application of the DyNoFlo model to small, medium, and large dairy farms showed that they could decrease their N leaching by 9, 20, and 25%, respectively, without reducing profits by varying management strategies according to ENSO phases.

Increasing density and chemical concentration both significantly reduced the population growth rate of Folsomia candida, in part through effects on food consumption and fecundity. The interaction between density and ivermectin concentration was ""less-than-additive,"" implying that at high density populations were able to compensate for the effects of the chemical. This result demonstrates that regulatory protocols carried out at low density (as in most past experiments) may seriously overestimate effects in the field, where densities are locally high and populations are resource limited (e.g., in feces of livestock treated with ivermectin).",,,,,"Sibly, Richard/0000-0001-6828-3543; Hutchinson, Tom/0000-0001-8823-5442",,,,,14,15,4,25,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We also investigate whether taxa behave as expected from known pollination characteristics (e.g. anemophilous vs. zoophilous) and whether the pollen-plant relationship differs between the undeveloped desert and agro-urban regions. Location We used a probability-based sampling scheme at 200, 900-m(2) sites across the Central Arizona-Phoenix region, a 6400-km(2) area of the south-western USA. Methods Pollen-plant abundances were mapped across the study area using interpolation techniques, summary bar charts and scatterplots, then two statistical approaches were applied to examine the data quantitatively. Firstly, we used regression analysis of paired pollen concentration and plant cover data; secondly, PC-ORD was used on a cross-matrix (contingency table) containing the presence/absence scores of both pollen and plants for each taxon at each site. Results Mapping and quantitative analysis revealed that pollen-plant relationships do vary both between anemophilous and zoophilous groupings and by individual taxon. They also revealed that distribution patterns of both pollen and plant abundance vary consistently across the three main landscape types (desert, urban, agricultural) and that pollen taxa groupings are consistent with pollination method and source plant distribution regardless of landscape type. Main conclusions These findings provide a broad range of comparative data to facilitate palynological reconstruction of past vegetation and aid in assessing types of prehistoric impacts on this vegetation. They also document that significant variation can occur in pollen rain across a city, even for taxa with widely distributed pollen, leading to the conclusion that forecasting pollen distribution patterns for allergy-related pollen types using only one or a few pollen traps is likely to entail substantial error.",,,,,"Gries, Corinna/0000-0002-9091-6543",,,,,10,12,0,20,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

This topic has been illuminated by recent studies on network mechanics, thanks to the concepts of hub, error and targeted removal, attack sensitivity, small world, and so forth. To forecast the effects of a species removal one can use an algorithm that unfolds a complex food web into a topologically simpler scheme, called its dominator tree. This structure is simple, elegant, and highly informative; all the bottlenecks and the effects of species removal are clearly traceable. While food web studies are mostly qualitative, in this paper the use of the dominator tree is extended to weighted food webs, in which link magnitude is specified. These structures were obtained from ecological flow networks. in eight of these food webs, the analysis consisted in removing links that were weaker than a threshold of magnitude and building the dominator tree associated to the remaining structure. By progressively increasing the threshold up to the value that would make the graph disconnected, we had the opportunity to investigate patterns of dominance as a function of link magnitude.

The primary focus was to provide a parameterization of host dispersal, which is involved in the calculation of two critical parameters of the model, namely patch Traversability and Recruitment. We used a dispersal kernel that can accommodate a variety of dispersal patterns, varying the proportion of dispersing hosts as a function of patch size (v), and the dispersing range of hosts (r). Model values were compared with a set of tick densities from an actual landscape. Correlations were very poor for low v and r, but greatly improved (R = 0.8-0.96, p = 0.0001) for high values of these parameters. This suggests the significance of long-range dispersers to keep this actual network of tick metapopulation patches. Further results of the dispersal kernel hint at the importance of short-range hosts in the maintenance of neighbouring, small, well-connected pitches. This abundance model involving climate suitability, habitat topology and host dispersal contributions, was applied to the tick Ixodes ricinus in a large area of northern Spain. The Recruitment at the patch level was calculated and used to forecast abundance of ticks across the study area. Sensitivity of every patch was defined as the response-range of Recruitment to quantitative changes in climate and topological features of the patch. To show how changes in the patch characteristics can dramatically alter the landscape composition and thence tick abundance, simulations were conducted in which the real landscape was modified by removing patches based on selected habitat features. The ecosystem was affected to the greatest extent by removal of patches of high sensitivity, large size, and high Recruitment. The proposed framework has particular utility for epidemiological studies aimed at evaluating the impact of climate change or habitat management on the survival of tick populations, and the health risks posed by ticks.

Location Richness patterns were assessed at local scales along the elevational gradient in two undisturbed treeline ecotones and one disturbed treeline ecotone in the Spanish Pyrenees. Methods We placed a rectangular plot (0.3-0.4 ha) in each treeline ecotone. We estimated and described the spatial patterns of plant richness using the point method and Moran's I correlograms. We delineated boundaries based on plant richness and tree cover using moving split windows and wavelet analysis. Then, to determine if floristic and tree cover boundaries were spatially related, overlap statistics were used. Results Plant richness increased above the forest limit and was negatively related to tree cover in the undisturbed sites. The mean size of richness patches in one of these sites was 10-15 m. Moving split windows and wavelets detected the sharpest changes in plant richness above the forest limit at both undisturbed sites. Most tree cover and plant richness boundaries were not spatially related. Main conclusions The upslope decrease of tree cover may explain the increase of plant richness across alpine treeline ecotones. However, the detection of abrupt richness boundaries well above the forest limit indicates the importance of local environmental heterogeneity to explain the patterns of plant richness at smaller scales. We found highly diverse microsites dominated by alpine species above the forest limit, which should be monitored to describe their response to the predicted upward shift of forests.",,,,"Gutierrez, Emilia/O-7568-2014; Camarero, J.

The objectives of this paper were to evaluate spatial sensitivity of predicted soil loss and runoff to climate change at large scales, and to simulate the ""regional"" impacts of climate change on soil erosion on the southern Great Plains. Relative climate changes at three spatial scales between 1950 to 99, and 2070 to 99, projected using HadCM(3) under the A2a, B2a, and GGa1 emission scenarios, were used to generate changed climates for Chickasha, Oklahoma. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was run for each climate scenario at three spatial scales with three tillage systems. The HadCM(3) predicted a general decrease in precipitation and an increase in the east-west precipitation gradient on the Southern Great Plains over the century. The decrease in precipitation resulted in general decreases in predicted runoff and soil loss. Percent changes, compared to the present climate, ranged from -33 to -3 percent for runoff and from -33 to 0 percent for soil loss. Variability of predicted runoff and soil loss over spatial scales was comparable to that between climate change scenarios. This finding suggests that the climatic impacts should be assessed at the spatial resolution at which global climate models have predictive skill, or at multiple spatial scales if the skillful resolution is unknown. The latter would yield additional information on uncertainty of predicted impacts due to uncertainty of spatial scales of climate input.",,,,,"Zhang, John/0000-0002-0082-8436",,,,,7,8,0,13,,,,0022-4561,,,J SOIL WATER CONSERV,J.

A ELAM model is an individual-based model (IBM) coupling a (1) Eulerian framework to govern the physical, hydrodynamic, and water quality domains, (2) Lagrangian framework to govern the sensory perception and movement trajectories of individual fish, and (3) agent framework to govern the behavior decisions of individuals. The resulting ELAM framework is well suited for describing large-scale patterns in hydrodynamics and water quality as well as the much smaller scales at which individual fish make movement decisions. This ability of ELAM models to simultaneously handle dynamics at multiple scales allows them to realistically represent fish movements within aquatic systems. We introduce ELAMs with an application to aid in the design and operation of fish passage systems in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Individual virtual fish make behavior decisions about every 2.0 s. These are sub-meter to meter-scale movements based on hydrodynamic stimuli obtained from a hydraulic model. Movement rules and behavior coefficients are systematically adjusted until the virtual fish movements approximate the observed fish. The ELAM model introduced in this paper is called the Numerical Fish Surrogate. It facilitated the development of a mechanistic biological-based hypothesis describing observed 3-D movement and passage response of downstream migrating juvenile salmon at 3 hydropower dams on 2 rivers with a total of 20 different structural and operational configurations. The Numerical Fish Surrogate is presently used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and public utility districts during project planning and design to forecast juvenile salmon movement and passage response to alternative bypass structures.

Deterministic models provide point estimates of X, the finite rate of increase, as well as measures of matrix sensitivity and elasticity. Stationary matrix models can be used to estimate extinction risk in a variable environment, but they assume that the matrix elements are randomly sampled from a stationary (i.e., non-changing) distribution. Here we outline a method for using nonstationary matrix model!; to construct realistic forecasts of population fluctuation in changing environments. Our method requires three pieces of data: (I) field estimates of transition matrix elements, (2) experimental data on the demographic responses of populations. to altered environmental conditions, and (3) forecasting data on environmental drivers. These three pieces of data are combined to generate a series of sequential transition matrices that emulate a pattern of long-term change in environmental drivers. Realistic estimates of population persistence and extinction risk can be derived from stochastic permutations of such a model. We illustrate the steps of this analysis with data from two population's of Sarracenia purpurea growing in northern New England. Sarracenia purpurea is a perennial carnivorous plant that is potentially at risk of local extinction because of increased nitrogen deposition. Long-term monitoring records or models of environmental change can be used to generate time series of driver variables under different scenarios of changing environments. Both manipulative and natural experiments can be used to construct a linking function that describes how matrix parameters change as a function of the environmental driver.

Lawson) is an economically and ecologically important conifer that has a wide geographic range in the western USA, but is mostly absent from the geographic centre of its distribution - the Great Basin and adjoining mountain ranges. Much of its modern range was achieved by migration of geographically distinct Sierra Nevada (P. ponderosa var. ponderosa) and Rocky Mountain (P. ponderosa var. scopulorum) varieties in the last 10,000 years. Previous research has confirmed genetic differences between the two varieties, and measurable genetic exchange occurs where their ranges now overlap in western Montana. A variety of approaches in bioclimatic modelling is required to explore the ecological differences between these varieties and their implications for historical biogeography and impending changes in western landscapes. Location Western USA. Methods We used a classification tree analysis and a minimum-volume ellipsoid as models to explain the broad patterns of distribution of ponderosa pine in modern environments using climatic and edaphic variables. Most biogeographical modelling assumes that the target group represents a single, ecologically uniform taxonomic population. Classification tree analysis does not require this assumption because it allows the creation of pathways that predict multiple positive and negative outcomes. Thus, classification tree analysis can be used to test the ecological uniformity of the species. In addition, a multidimensional ellipsoid was constructed to describe the niche of each variety of ponderosa pine, and distances from the niche were calculated and mapped on a 4-km grid for each ecological variable. Results The resulting classification tree identified three dominant pathways predicting ponderosa pine presence. Two of these three pathways correspond roughly to the distribution of var. ponderosa, and the third pathway generally corresponds to the distribution of var. scopulorum. The classification tree and minimum-volume ellipsoid model show that both varieties have very similar temperature limitations, although var. ponderosa is more limited by the temperature extremes of the continental interior. The precipitation limitations of the two varieties are seasonally different, with var. ponderosa requiring significant winter moisture and var. scopulorum requiring significant summer moisture. Great Basin mountain ranges are too cold at higher elevations to support either variety of ponderosa pine, and at lower elevations are too dry in summer for var. scopulorum and too dry in winter for var. ponderosa. Main conclusions The classification tree analysis indicates that var. ponderosa is ecologically as well as genetically distinct from var. scopulorum. Ecological differences may maintain genetic separation in spite of a limited zone of introgression between the two varieties in western Montana. Two hypotheses about past and future movements of ponderosa pine emerge from our analyses. The first hypothesis is that, during the last glacial period, colder and/or drier summers truncated most of the range of var. scopulorum in the central Rockies, but had less dramatic effects on the more maritime and winter-wet distribution of var. ponderosa. The second hypothesis is that, all other factors held constant, increasing summer temperatures in the future should produce changes in the distribution of var. scopulorum that are likely to involve range expansions in the central Rockies with the warming of mountain ranges currently too cold but sufficiently wet in summer for var. scopulorum.

We discuss how changes in the mean and variability in climatic regimes, as modified by local and regional factors, can lead to complex patterns of species distribution rather than simple range shifts. We describe how ecological forecasting may be used to generate explicit hypotheses regarding the likely impacts of different climatic change scenarios on the distribution of intertidal species and how related hindcasting methods can be used to evaluate changes that have already been detected.

With the help of humans, exotic species have piggybacked their way to distant lands, which in combination with the loss of endemic native species, has led to the convergence of biological communities toward common and ubiquitous forms. However, the extent to which this ""biotic homogenization"" varies along gradients of human population size and urbanization remains mostly unexplored, especially at broad spatial scales. The present paper combines a recent conceptual model of homogenization with estimates of species invasions and extinctions to provide the first estimates of homogenization for five major taxonomic groups - land birds, freshwater fish, terrestrial mammals, plants, and freshwater reptiles and amphibians - at the continental-scale of North America (exclusive of Mexico). On average, the greatest levels of biotic homogenization were predicted for plants (22%) and fishes (14%), followed by reptiles/amphibians (12%), mammals (9%) and birds (8%). Substantial spatial variation in predictions of community similarity exists and emphasize that the outcome of species invasions and extinctions may not only increase community similarity, but may also decrease it (i.e., differentiation). Homogenization is predicted to be greatest for fish in southwestern and northeastern US, highest in eastern North America for plants, greatest for birds and mammals along the west coast of North America, and peak in southern US for reptiles and amphibians. We show that predicted change in community similarity for all taxonomic groups is positively related to human population size and urbanization, thus providing the first quantitative linkage between human population geography and homogenization for a number of major taxonomic groups at the continental-scale of North America. Our study helps identify regional hotspots of biotic homogenization across North America, thus setting the stage for future studies where more directed investigations of biotic homogenization along urban gradients can be conducted.

Thus, a universal model should be established to simulate and forecast the effects of different kinds of habitat destruction on species diversity during different historical periods. In this paper, we explore a multi-time-scale n-species model to study and compare species responses to instantaneous and continuous destruction. We find that (1) under instantaneous destruction, there are two different mechanisms of species extinction: one is a time-delayed deterministic extinction of superior competitors in order from the best to the poorest; the other is the extinction in a short time of inferior competitors. The survivors will experience three phases: decline, adjustment, and equilibrium. (2) When the total amounts of habitat destruction for both instantaneous and continuous cases are equal, the oscillation amplitudes of species abundances under instantaneous destruction are much greater than under continuous destruction, especially for inferior competitors, which make inferior competitors under instantaneous destruction more prone to stochastic extinction. Therefore instantaneous destruction is more detrimental to the survival of inferior competitors. (3) Under continuous destruction with habitat eventually being destroyed completely, there also are two types of species extinction mechanisms: the first is extinction in order from the best competitors to the poorest before complete destruction; the second is collective extinction due to complete destruction.",,,,,,,,,,9,16,1,21,,,,0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

We have implemented simple pollution indicators based on a semi lagrangian particle drift simulation using the Mercator surface current forecast and ECMWF wind speed. Shipping routes are the main places for genesis of oil spills. We have simulated the drift of particles sown daily along the main ship routes defined from the traffic separation schemes in the North Atlantic for a 3year period. For each season, we count the number of particles run aground by area of one degree per one degree. According to this number we allocate a pollution risk level to the section of the coast corresponding to the grounding. We then produce the first indicator which is a map showing the pollution risk level along the shore with a traffic light color scale: green, yellow, red, with red meaning high risk. The second indicator is deduced from the first one. Particles are tracked back to their initial location to identify the potential origin of the coastal pollution. This shows sections of ship routes with potential coastal pollution risk in the case of pollutant sewage along the ship route. The robustness of the computation of these indicators was assessed using the surface current from several other GODAE operational assimilation centers such as FOAM and RSMAS-HYCOM to compute the same indicators. We have also added noise to Mercator currents to evaluate the dispersion of the results.

In Europe, accumulation of DA in shellfish has led to shellfish harvesting closures in western Scottish waters since 1999. However, little is yet known of the temporal appearance and succession of Pseudo-nitzschia species and how this may relate to environmental forcing. A phytoplankton monitoring programme was established for almost 3 yr at a coastal station in western Scottish waters to study the diversity and seasonal variation of Pseudo-nitzschia species in relation to physical and chemical parameters of the water column. Samples were collected with a high temporal resolution. Annually repeatable seasonal patterns of Pseudo-nitzschia abundance were evident. Pseudo-nitzschia cells were categorised by shape and size into 2 groups, the 'delicatissima-group' and the 'seriata-group'. Cluster analysis demonstrated the different dynamics of the 2 Pseudo-nitzschia groups. The delicatissima-group was dominated in spring by non-toxic P. delicatissima, while the seriata-group occurred mainly during the summer months. Summer to autumn blooms of both groups were composed of several species, including toxic P. australis and P. seriata and potentially toxic P. pseudo-delicatissima. Redundancy analysis indicated that 31% of the variance in Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance could be explained by the measured environmental variables. The repeatable annual nature of the blooms suggests that deterministic forecasting of the timing of future toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. events may be an achievable goal.",,,,"Bolch, Christopher J/J-7619-2014; Davidson, Keith/A-5474-2013","Bolch, Christopher J/0000-0001-9047-2391; Davidson, Keith/0000-0001-9269-3227",,,,,82,84,1,21,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Fuzzy logic approach is one of these methods that can be used for forecasting purposes and identification of complex systems. In this study, it is aimed to model monthly dissolved oxygen (DO) amount variations. Firstly, regression technique is used to remove the trend from the actual dissolved oxygen time series. Detrended time series is then modeled with Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy logic approach. The monthly historical records of DO as considered in this paper provide a fundamental data exhibiting persistence. It is this dependence that gives opportunity for the serial modeling of the data sequence concerned. These models are the prime and sole means to derive the future likely excedences over the historical values and hence provide a chance for the future planner with decision variables such as the minimum DO amounts and their persistence for some duration. In the scope of this study, DO concentration changes in the two stations located in Golden Horn at the 0.5 m (upper layer) depth were modeled. As a result of the study, it is seen that one can forecast the next month's DO amount from antecedent measurements within an acceptable relative error limits. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We propose here a way of spatializing the model that assimilates information obtained from remote sensing images made during the growing season. The method was applied to yield estimates from the SUCROS sugar beet model, run for about 50 fields within two sugar factory areas. The assimilation of four to six SPOT and aerial photography data values into the SUCROS model, coupled with the scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) reflectance model, re-estimated crop establishment and root system settling parameters, to which the model was particularly sensitive. The field-by-field yield estimates were improved (i.e., with remote sensing data assimilation, the relative root mean square error decreased from 20% to about 10%). The key factors of the method are the number and timing of images that determine the number and the type of parameters that can be estimated. The main limitation of this method is the lack of robustness of the crop model in simulating LAI in serious drought conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The El Nino-Southern Oscillation, (ENSO) and the Pacific-Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affect winter temperature and precipitation regimes in western North America through mid-latitude tele-connections. This study examines relationships of ENSO and the PDO to drought-induced fire occurrence in subalpine forests of three study areas across the Rocky Mountains: Jasper National Park (JNP, northern Rockies), Yellowstone National Park (YNP, central Rockies) and Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP, southern Rockies) over the 1700-1975 period. Large-scale climatic anomalies captured by ENSO (NINO3) and PDO indices had differential effects on large-fire occurrence across the study areas. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) showed that large fires in RMNP occurred during extreme La Nina years, while the PDO, although predominantly negative during fire years, did not depart significantly from the mean. In YNP and JNP, neither ENSO nor PDO indices were significantly different from the mean during large-fire years, although fires tended to occur during El. Nino and positive PDO years. Constructive phases (years of combined warm [positive] or cool [negative] phases) of ENSO and the PDO were significantly associated with large-fire occurrence across the Rockies, even though these large-scale climatic anomalies were not significant when considered singly in SEAs. Combined warm phases (positive PDO during El Nino) co-occurred with large fires in the central and northern Rockies, while the combined cool phases (negative PDO during La Nina) appeared to promote large fires in the southern Rockies. Almost 70% of large fires in RMNP burned during La Nina events that coincided with a negative PDO, although these phases co-occurred during only 29% of the 1700-1975 period. Spatial teleconnection patterns between drought, PDO and ENSO across western North America independently support the sign and strength of relationships between these climatic anomalies and subalpine fire occurrence along a broad north-south gradient of the Rockies. Forecasts of ENSO that are dependent on the expected PDO phase suggest promise for fire hazard prediction across the West.",,,,"Romme, William/C-7317-2016; Veblen, Thomas T./U-6461-2018",,,,,,103,111,2,34,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Recent studies have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long-term viability of coral reefs. These assertions are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) to the local conditions around representative coral reefs. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive global assessment of coral bleaching under climate change by adapting the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method to the output of a low- and high-climate sensitivity GCM. First, we develop and test algorithms for predicting mass coral bleaching with GCM-resolution sea surface temperatures for thousands of coral reefs, using a global coral reef map and 1985-2002 bleaching prediction data. We then use the algorithms to determine the frequency of coral bleaching and required thermal adaptation by corals and their endosymbionts under two different emissions scenarios. The results indicate that bleaching could become an annual or biannual event for the vast majority of the world's coral reefs in the next 30-50 years without an increase in thermal tolerance of 0.2-1.0 degrees C per decade. The geographic variability in required thermal adaptation found in each model and emissions scenario suggests that coral reefs in some regions, like Micronesia and western Polynesia, may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Advances in modelling and monitoring will refine the forecast for individual reefs, but this assessment concludes that the global prognosis is unlikely to change without an accelerated effort to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.",,,,"Skirving, William/E-7927-2011; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove/H-6169-2011","Skirving, William/0000-0003-0167-6427; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove/0000-0001-7510-6713",,,,,356,365,15,328,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

This paper is intended to provide a broad overview of current knowledge of these issues. Information on changes in the status of species, size of populations, and extent and condition of habitats is patchy, with little data available for many of the taxa, regions and habitats of greatest importance to the delivery of ecosystem services. However, what we do know strongly suggests that, while exceptions exist, the changes currently underway are for the most part negative, anthropogenic in origin, ominously large and accelerating. The impacts of these changes on human society are idiosyncratic and patchily understood, but for the most part also appear to be negative and substantial. Forecasting future changes is limited by our poor understanding of the cascading impacts of change within communities, of threshold effects, of interactions between the drivers of change, and of linkages between the state of nature and human well-being. In assessing future science needs, we not only see a strong role for ecological data and theory, but also believe that much closer collaboration with social and earth system scientists is essential if ecology is to have a strong bearing on policy makers.",,,,"Wrbka, Thomas/A-5699-2010","Wrbka, Thomas/0000-0002-1451-9108; Bond, William/0000-0002-3441-2084; Balmford, Andrew/0000-0002-0144-3589",,,,,162,169,6,207,,,,1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Regulation of flow by dams, straightening and narrowing of channels by various piers and wing dams, and homogenization of bed structure are some of the major impacts. As a result, the conditions for many riverine organisms have been altered. Removing physical constructions and returning boulders to the channels can potentially restore conditions for these organisms. Here we describe the history of log driving, review its impact on physical and biological conditions and processes, and predict the responses to restoration. Reviewing the literature on comparable restoration efforts and building upon this knowledge, using boreal Swedish rivers as an example, we address the last point. We hypothesize that restoration measures will make rivers wider and more sinuous, and provide rougher bottoms, thus improving land-water interactions and increasing the retention capacity of water, sediment, organic matter and nutrients. The geomorphic and hydraulic/hydrologic alterations are supposed to favor production, diversity, migration and reproduction of riparian and aquatic organisms. The response rates are likely to vary according to the types of processes and organisms.

Recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model projections and there remains a need to test the accuracy of models and to reduce uncertainties. Testing of models has been limited by a lack of data against which projections of future ranges can be tested. Here we provide a first test of the predictive accuracy of such models using observed species' range shifts and climate change in two periods of the recent past. Location Britain. Methods Observed range shifts for 116 breeding bird species in Britain between 1967 and 1972 (t(1)) and 1987-91 (t(2)) are used. We project range shifts between t(1) and t(2) for each species based on observed climate using 16 alternative models (4 methods x 2 data parameterizations x 2 rules to transform probabilities of occurrence into presence and absence records). Results Modelling results were extremely variable, with projected range shifts varying both in magnitude and in direction from observed changes and from each other. However, using approaches that explore the central tendency (consensus) of model projections, we were able to improve agreement between projected and observed shifts significantly.

Wetland S retention, vegetation composition, and thickness of surficial deposits were also found to influence lake SO42- concentrations.

Comparison of atmospheric deposition of base cations and simulated drainage loss during this period indicates that decreases in atmospheric base cation deposition were partially responsible for decreases in lake base cation concentrations. Decreases in drainage loss of base cations were mainly a result of declines in net loss from soil exchange sites associated with decreases in SO42- leaching. Model forecasts generally suggest further decreases in SO42- concentrations and increases in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in lake water and soil percent base saturation (BS) at most of the DDRP lake watersheds under three future emission control scenarios, with the more aggressive control scenarios resulting in faster recovery from acidic deposition. Under an aggressive control scenario, surface water ANC is simulated to increase at a median rate of 0.30 mu eq.L-1.yr(-1) in northern New England and 0.22 mu eq.L-1.yr(-1) in Maine.

Numerous assessments of plant response to elevated [CO2] have been conducted in chambers and enclosures, with only a few studies reporting responses in fully open-air, field conditions. Reported yields for the world's two major grain crops, wheat and rice, are substantially lower in free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) than predicted from similar elevated [CO2] experiments within chambers. This discrepancy has major implications for forecasting future global food supply. Globally, the leguminous-crop soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is planted on more land than any other dicotyledonous crop. Previous studies have shown that total dry mass production increased on average 37% in response to increasing [CO2] to approximately 700 ppm, but harvestable yield will increase only 24%. Is this representative of soybean responses under open-air field conditions? The effects of elevation of [CO2] to 550 ppm on total production, partitioning and yield of soybean over 3 years are reported. This is the first FACE study of soybean (http://www.soyface.uiuc.edu) and the first on crops in the Midwest of North America, one of the major food production regions of the globe. Although increases in both aboveground net primary production (17-18%) and yield (15%) were consistent across three growing seasons and two cultivars, the relative stimulation was less than projected from previous chamber experiments. As in previous studies, partitioning to seed dry mass decreased; however, net production during vegetative growth did not increase and crop maturation was delayed, not accelerated as previously reported. These results suggest that chamber studies may have over-estimated the stimulatory effect of rising [CO2], with important implications on global food supply forecasts.",,,,"Long, Stephen P/A-2488-2008; Long, Stephen/AAA-1741-2019","Long, Stephen P/0000-0002-8501-7164; Morgan, Patrick/0000-0003-0233-2458",,,,,97,105,3,47,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Calyptrate flies include numerous species that are disease vectors and have a high nuisance value, notably Musca domestica. Populations are often associated with livestock farms and domestic waste disposal facilities such as landfill, where the accumulating organic matter provides suitable breeding conditions for a range of species. 2. We examined the relationship between fly numbers and weather conditions using a 4-year data set of weekly fly catches from six sites in southern UK, together with meteorological data. The first 3 years were used to develop predictive models, and these were then used to forecast fly populations in the fourth year. The accuracy of these predictions was assessed by comparison with the actual fly catches for that year. Separate models were developed for M. domestica, Calliphora spp. and all calyptrate flies combined. 3. Predictions based only on humidity, temperature and rainfall were strongly correlated with observed data (r(2) values ranged from 0.52 to 0.84), suggesting that fly population changes are largely driven by the weather rather than by biotic factors. We can forecast fly populations so that control measures need only be deployed when weather conditions are suitable for a fly outbreak, reducing the need for prophylactic insecticide use. 4. Climate change was simulated using the most recent predictions of future temperature increases. Our models predicted substantial increases in fly populations up to 244% by 2080 compared with current levels, with the greatest increases occurring in the summer months. 5. Synthesis and applications. Models developed use weather data to predict populations of pestiferous flies such as M. domestica, which may prove valuable in integrated control programmes. These models predict substantial increases in fly populations in the future under likely scenarios of climate change.

Biological invasions have an anthropogenic origin, and although many species are able to spread on their own within the newly invaded area, long-distance dispersal events shown to accelerate rates of spread are frequently associated with human activities. In a previous study, the performances of several invasion models of the spread of the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella in Germany were compared, demonstrating that the best model in qualitative and quantitative terms was a stratified dispersal model taking into account the effect of human population density on the probability of long-distance dispersal events. 2. Similar data were collected in France over 4 years (2000-2004, 5274 observation points). These data were used to assess the performance of the best-fit models from Germany using the original parameters and to model the spread of the leafminer in France. 3. The stratified dispersal model accounting for variations in human population density developed in Germany, predicted the invasion of France with a similar level of predictive power as in the area where it was developed. This suggests that an equivalent level of predictability can be expected in a newly invaded country with similar environmental conditions. 4. We applied the model to forecast the future invasion dynamics in the UK from 2005 to 2008, based on the first observations of Cameraria in the country in 2002-2004. Predictions are discussed in the light of different prevailing environmental conditions. 5. Synthesis and application. The model and predictions developed in this study provide one of the few examples of an a priori model of invasion in a newly invaded country, and provide a simple modelling framework that can be used to explore the spread of other invading organisms. In the case of Cameraria, little can be done to prevent or slow its spread but our model, by predicting changes in distribution and rates of spread, provides fore-warning of where and when damaging pest populations are likely to appear.",,,,"Guichard, Sylvain/F-8706-2011; Gregoire, Jean-Claude/F-4397-2011; Gilbert, Marius/C-6969-2009","Gilbert, Marius/0000-0003-3708-3359; Gregoire, Jean-Claude/0000-0002-3346-4130",,,,,60,64,0,26,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The effects of the date and intensity of tapping, rainfall and the minimum and maximum temperatures at tapping and gum collection on gum arabic yield were examined for eight years (1992-1999/2000) in a 12-year-old plantation. The objective of the study was to establish an understanding of the causes of variability in gum arabic yield and yield trends as a basis for yield control, prediction and stability. The results showed tapping dates produced roughly similar gum production patterns across years. Yield was found to be positively correlated with tapping intensity, rainfall and the minimum and maximum temperatures at tapping time, and negatively correlated with tapping time and the minimum and maximum temperatures at gum collection. The time of tapping, tapping intensity, rainfall and the maximum temperature at gum collection were found to explain 85% of the total variability in gum yield per unit area. The gum yield (g) of the first pick was highly correlated (r = 0.93) with total yield (g/tree). The simple regression model based on this relationship was highly significant (p = 0.008). These models could help in understanding the causes of yield variability in gum arabic and can be used for estimating the yield of a current year based on the rainfall of the previous year under a prescribed plan of tapping. The yield of the current year can also be predicted using simple models based on the commencement of tapping and the yield of the first pick. In addition, the results can help to predict future gum yield depending on rainfall, temperature forecasts and the average tapping date and intensity used by gum farmers in western Sudan.

Owing to such ecological considerations, it is essential to understand the role that climate might play in the interannual variability of these organisms and the mechanisms by which it could modify the ecosystem functioning. In this study, a causal chain of meteorological, hydrological and ecological processes linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was identified in the Ligurian Sea, Northwestern Mediterranean. The forcing by the NAO drives most of the hydro-climatic variability during winter and early spring. Subsequently, interannual and decadal changes of the dominant copepods Centropages typicus and Temora stylifera were significantly correlated to the state of the hydro-climatic signal and tightly coupled to the NAO. Direct and indirect effects whose influence promoted phenological changes in the two copepod populations drove the species' responses to climatic forcing. Opposite responses of the analysed species were also highlighted by these results. While years characterized by the positive phase of the NAO leads to enhancement of the strength and the forward move of the C. typicus peak, they act negatively on the annual cycle of T. stylifera, the abundance of which drops twofold and the annual peak appears delayed in time. In contrast, low NAO years lead to high abundance of T. stylifera and a forward timing of its peak, and acts in turn negatively on the C. typicus annual cycle in both abundance (low) and timing (delayed). Owing to the synchronism between hydro-climatic conditions and the NAO, and the major role of these species in the pelagic ecosystem of the studied area, these results provide key elements for interpreting and forecasting decadal changes of planktonic populations in the Ligurian Sea.",,,,"Souissi, Sami/C-5146-2018","Souissi, Sami/0000-0002-6720-0096",,,,,43,44,1,11,,,,0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2005,145,4,,,,,640,649,,10.1007/s00442-005-0130-4,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000232559900014,15965753,,,,

In this paper, we review the theory of recruitment phase transitions using a marine fisheries perspective. We propose that transitions in recruitment are dependent upon the balance of activating and constraining processes of recruitment control, and we highlight fundamental differences in recruitment transitions precipitated by climate events, those related to community alterations, and those manifested by fishery practices (though each is not necessarily mutually exclusive). We maintain that the emergent properties of fisheries populations post-phase transition are contingent upon their histories, their differing initial states, the degree of food web complexity, interaction strengths among interspecifics, and contrasting external forcing, any or all of which may be dissimilar between one regime and another. We suggest that it may be challenging to forecast recruitment phase transitions, though we encourage efforts to determine whether there are unifying relationships that govern recruitment dynamics.

By contrast, theory in community ecology draws from a tradition of determinism: focusing on the processes (competition, predation) that promote the coexistence of groups of species (i.e., coexistence), while generally ignoring environmental variation in these processes (process noise or environmental stochasticity). Here I considered the role of deterministic and stochastic sources of variation in a predator-prey interaction on the probability of prey population extinction. Using discrete-time stochastic versions of a classic predator-prey model I show that even low levels of predator process noise increase the probability of prey extinction. Surprisingly, predator process noise has stronger negative effects on prey persistence than stochasticity in the population growth rate of the prey species itself. This conclusion is robust across a wide range of deterministic model behaviors, suggesting that the effects of stochastic variation in predator abundance on prey persistence may be pervasive. I then applied these insights to the management of endangered prey populations threatened by a nonnative predator and examined the relative efficacy of three predator control techniques at reviving declining prey populations. These techniques included immediate eradication and reduction of predator populations through either ""proportional"" harvest or ""trigger"" harvest. Under a proportional harvest regime, a constant proportion of predators were removed each year, with little attention paid to the natural variation experienced by predator populations. By contrast, I implemented trigger harvest by reducing predator abundance to a fixed threshold abundance level only in years in which the predator exceeds this harvest threshold. Trigger harvest reduces both the relative abundance and variance of predators, whereas proportional harvest only reduces the abundance of these species. My analysis suggests that the reduction of predator variance through trigger harvest can revive declining prey populations and, in some cases, revive them more effectively than a proportional reduction of predator abundance: the default control strategy when eradication cannot be achieved.",,,,"Sabo, John/B-1872-2013",,,,,,26,26,0,17,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2005,86,9,,,,,2329,2343,,10.1890/04-1152,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000231373600008,,,,,

Hindcasting studies aim to emphasize among a large set of habitat variables those that are of interest for the focus species, whereas forecasting studies are intended to predict habitat selection according to a small number of habitat variables for a given area. We provide here a new analytical tool which relies on the concept of ecological niche, the K-select analysis, for hindcasting studies of habitat selection by animals using radio-tracking data. Each habitat variable defines one dimension in the ecological space. For each animal, the difference between the vector of average available habitat conditions and the vector of average used conditions defines the marginality vector. Its size is proportional to the importance of habitat selection, and its direction indicates which variables are selected. By performing a non-centered principal component analysis of the table containing the coordinates of the marginality vectors of each animal (row) on the habitat variables (column), the K-select analysis returns a linear combination of habitat variables for which the average marginality is greatest. It is a synthesis of variables which contributes the most to the habitat selection. As with principal component analysis, the biological significance of the factorial axes is deduced from the loading of variables. An example is provided: habitat selection by wild boar is studied in a Mediterranean habitat using the K-select analysis. The numerous advantages of the analysis (a large number of variables that can be included, individual variability in habitat selection taken into account, a lack of too strict underlying hypotheses) make it a powerful approach in radio-tracking studies designed to identify habitat variables that are selected by animals.

Because people depend on biological systems for water, food and other ecosystem services, predicting the range of responses to global change for various ecosystem types in different geographic locations is a high priority. Modeling exercises and manipulative experimentation have been the principle approaches used to place upper and lower bounds on community and ecosystem responses. However, each of these approaches has recognized limitations. Manipulative experiments cannot vary all the relevant factors and are often performed at small spatio-temporal scales. Modeling is limited by data availability and by our knowledge of how current observations translate into future conditions. These weaknesses would improve if we could observe ecosystems that have already responded to global change factors and thus presage shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Here we consider whether urban forest remnants might offer this ability. As urban forests have been exposed to elevated temperature, carbon dioxide, nitrogen deposition and ozone for many decades, they may be ahead of the global change ""response curve"" for forests in their region. Therefore, not only might forests along urbanization gradients provide us with natural experiments for studying current responses to global change factors, but their legacy of response to past urbanization may also constitute space-for-time substitution experiments for predicting likely regional forest responses to continued environmental change. For this approach to be successful, appropriate criteria must be developed for selecting forest remnants and plots that would optimize our ability to detect incipient forest responses to spatial variation in global change factors along urbanization gradients, while minimizing artifacts associated with remnant size and factors other than those that simulate global change. Studying forests that meet such criteria along urban-to-rural gradients could become an informative part of a mixed strategy of approaches for improving forecasts of forest ecosystem change at the regional scale.",,,,"Romero, Luz/E-7993-2012",,,,,,63,70,4,77,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,AUG,2005,8,5,,,,,568,582,,10.1007/s10021-003-0172-6,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000231988900010,,,,,

However, if we knew the effect of specific traits on modelling results, we could both improve the sampling design for particular species and properly judge model performance. In this study, we first model spatial variation in winter bird density in a large region (Central Spain) applying regression trees to 64 species. Then we associate model accuracy to characteristics of species describing their habitat selection, environmental specialization, maximum densities in the study region, gregariousness, detectability and body size. Predictive power of models covaried with model characteristics (i.e., sample size) and autoecological traits of species, with 48% of interspecific variability being explained by two partial least regression components. There are species-specific characteristics constraining abundance forecasting that are rooted in the natural history of organisms. Controlling for the positive effect of prevalence, the better predicted species had high environmental specialization and reached higher maximum densities. We also detected a measurable positive effect of species detectability. Thus, generalist species and those locally scarce and inconspicuous are unlikely to be modelled with great accuracy. Our results suggest that the limitations caused by those species-specific traits associated with survey work (e.g., conspicuousness, gregariousness or maximum ecological densities) will be difficult to circumvent by either statistical approaches or increasing sampling effort while recording biodiversity in extensive programs.

This paper addresses the problem of the prediction of such two pollutants, using to this end several statistical approaches. In particular, feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), currently recognized as state-of-the-art approach for statistical prediction of air quality, are compared with two alternative approaches derived from machine learning: pruned neural networks (PNNs) and lazy learning (LL). PNNs constitute a parameter-parsimonious approach, based on the removal of redundant parameters from fully connected neural networks; LL, on the other hand, is a local linear prediction algorithm, which performs a local learning procedure each time a prediction is required. All the three approaches are tested in the prediction of ozone and PM10; predictors are trained to return at 9 a.m. the concentration estimated for the current day. No strong differences are found between the forecast accuracies of the different models; nevertheless, LL provides the best performances on indicators related to average goodness of the prediction (correlation, mean absolute error, etc.), while PNNs are superior to the other approaches in detecting of the exceedances of alarm and attention thresholds. In some cases, data-deseasonalization is found to improve the prediction accuracy of the models. Finally, some striking features of lazy learning deserve consideration: the LL predictor can be quickly designed, and, thanks to the simplicity of the local linear regressors, it both gets rid of overfitting problems and can be readily interpreted; moreover, it can be also easily kept up-to-date.

This study examines the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater fish distributions in Canada. Climate normals data (means from 1961 to 1990) from Environment Canada were used to map current climate found throughout the tertiary watersheds of Canada. Logistic regressions based on these climate data were used to develop predictive presence-absence equations for (a) common commercially and recreationally important species and (b) an Arctic freshwater species and a freshwater fish species of conservation significance listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife (COSEWIC). The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Global Coupled Model 2(IS92a) provided forecasts of Canada's climate in 2020 and 2050. The data from this scenario and the logistic regressions provided a ready framework for predicting the potential distributions of the fishes. Physical and ecological barriers would have to be overcome for the distribution of these species to actually change in response to climate change. Generally, coldwater species may be extirpated from much of their present range while cool and warm-water species may expand northward. Species that are limited to the most southern regions of the country may expand northwards. A conceptual framework for assessing potential climate change impacts on fishes and the variety of management strategies required to deal with these impacts are discussed. Our forecasts demonstrate the need for climate change assessments in species at risk as well as for common species.",,,,"Chu, C/C-9091-2009",,,,,,126,131,4,141,,,,1366-9516,,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

When a P index has multiple variables and mathematical operations, it is often difficult to predict the sensitivity of the final site rating to individual input variables. Sensitivity analysis is a powerful diagnostic technique for assessing the behavior of a P index, prioritizing data collection and research efforts to improve its predictive capabilities, and for focusing management efforts. In this study, nominal range sensitivity analysis was used to determine the effect of input factor perturbations on the final P index score for agricultural biosolids recycling. Baseline conditions (P index score = 116) for the sensitivity analysis were established from a detailed evaluation of representative Pennsylvania sites targeted for biosolids application in 2003. The base condition was evaluated for Sensitivity Coefficient and Swing to identify the importance of individual input factors on final P index rating. For biosolids sites, P loss vulnerability forecast by the Pennsylvania P index was found to be relatively insensitive to subsurface drainage and mineral fertilizer application rate and method (with Swing values of 23, 18, and 4 respectively). Accordingly, uncertainty in these Low Impact P index variables will have little adverse effect on the reliability of index scores for biosolids land application. For sites receiving biosolids, the Pennsylvania P index is most sensitive to the biosotids application rate and method, organic P source coefficient, and nature of the site buffer strip. Remarkably, varying the P source coefficient (alone) over its full range of plausible input values resulted in a P index rating Swing of 167 points. Thus, beyond changing biosolids application rates and methods, the greatest potential to reduce the P index score is in establishing riparian buffer zones and reducing biosotids P source coefficients. It is important to note that the differential sensitivities of fertilizer P source rate and organic P source rate in the Pennsylvania index do not imply that organic P sources are inherently more susceptible to offsite P export than chemical fertilizers. Research efforts should focus on High-impact factors for improving the predictive capability of the P index.",,,,,,,,,,6,6,1,3,,,,0022-4561,,,J SOIL WATER CONSERV,J.

These characteristics of tick populations are closely linked to habitat suitability, which reflects the limiting ecological factors and landscape features affecting tick populations; however, little work has been done on the regional assessment of habitat suitability. In this study, a regional model for the distribution and abundance of the tick Ixodes ricinus in central Spain is developed. An occurrence and an abundance model were constructed; climate and vegetation variables were found to be the main predictors of both occurrence and density in a relatively homogeneous matrix of habitat patches, whereas topographical variables were found to have small contributions and were therefore discarded. The residuals of the abundance model showed good correlation with the isolation of each patch. The predictive power of the abundance model was greatly enhanced by inclusion of the traversability (a measure of the permeability of each patch to the propagules of the metapopulation) and recruitment (an index of the relative importance of each patch to the traffic through the entire habitat network). The removal from the landscape of the patches whose recruitment values were in the top 10% has a critical effect on tick density, an effect not observed when patches are removed at random. These results indicate that permanent tick populations can be sustained only in landscapes containing a minimum network of viable sites.

The causes for such a decline are not completely understood; however, climate change has been identified as a possible cause for amphibian extinction, among others. Ecological niche modeling has proven to be a useful tool to predict potential distribution of species in the context of climatic changes. In this paper, we used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) to model the potential distributions of two species of plethodontid salamanders: Pseudoeurycea cephalica and P leprosa. We projected their potential distributions under climatic scenarios expected in 50 yr based on a conservative scenario of global climate change and assuming a moderate dispersal ability for both species. Our analyses suggest that climate change effects may pose an additional long-term risk to both species of plethodontid salamanders, with a more dramatic scenario in the case of P leprosa. By the year 2050, this species may lose almost 75 percent of its distributional area, and this projection is even worse when deforestation (in the way it is occurring at present) is considered within the predicted model. Our results concur with those obtained for species with limited dispersal capability because they do not track changing climates, but rather face a loss of distributional area. The survival of these species is not secure, even though their potential distributional area falls within a considerable number of natural protected areas.",,,,"de Leon, Gerardo Perez Ponce/U-3869-2017; Martinez-Meyer, Enrique/B-1464-2008","de Leon, Gerardo Perez Ponce/0000-0001-6472-5113; Martinez-Meyer, Enrique/0000-0003-1184-9264",,,,,29,35,1,26,,,,0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JUN,2005,37,2,,,,,202,208,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2005.00027.x,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000229355500007,,,,,

In southern California, population growth and economic expansion are the primary drivers of land use change, and the population is expected to double in 40 years. Although directly adjacent to the region's largest metropolitan area, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) remains mostly undeveloped, with 50 % of the area protected as parkland. In this study, a cellular automaton (CA) model was calibrated using historical growth patterns in the region, and used to forecast three scenarios of urban growth in the SMMNRA from 2000 to 2050, with development prohibited on slopes greater than 25 %, 30 %, and 60 % slope. Habitat pattern and extent under these scenarios was assessed using several landscape metrics, then compared to results from a GIS overlay model developed for the same region. The CA model predicted urbanization to increase from 11 % of the landscape in 2000 to 26 %, 35 %, and 47 % in 2050, respectively, for the three slope scenarios. In 2000, the majority of vegetation constituted one large, interconnected patch. With development prohibited beyond 25 % and 30 % slope, this patch will become, by 2050, increasingly perforated, but should stay relatively intact. However, if growth is permitted up to 60 % slope, the patch breaks apart, resulting in a shift in spatial pattern dynamics on the landscape (as reflected by other landscape metrics). General growth patterns predicted by the GIS overlay model resembled those generated by the CA, but the CA model produced more patches and edge in the landscape. Because it is temporally explicit, the CA model was able to capture non-linear, emergent behavior and a phase transition in the type of growth occurring in the landscape that was not apparent in the GIS overlay predictions.

Most assessments of sprawl, or undesired growth patterns, have focused on quantifying land-use changes in urban and metropolitan areas. It is critical for ecologists to examine and improve understanding of land-use changes beyond the urban fringe-also called exurban sprawl-because of the extensive and widespread changes that are occurring, and which often are located adjacent to or nearby ""protected"" lands. The primary goal of this paper is to describe the development of a nationwide, fine-grained database of historical, current, and forecasted housing density, which enables these changes to be quantified as a foundation for inference of possible ecological effects. Forecasted patterns were generated by the Spatially Explicit Regional Growth Model, which relates historical growth patterns with accessibility to urban and protected lands. Secondary goals are to report briefly on the status and trend of exurban land-use changes across the U. S., and to introduce a landscape sprawl metric that captures patterns of land-use change. In 2000, there were 125 729 km(2) in urban and suburban (< 0.68 ha per unit) residential housing density nationwide (coterminous USA), but there were slightly over seven times that (917 090 km(2)) in exurban housing density (0.68-16.18 ha per unit). The developed footprint has grown from 10.1% to 13.3% (1980 to 2000), roughly at a rate of 1.60% per year. This rate of land development outpaced the population growth rate (1.18% per year) by 25%.

In particular, the dependence of the potential predictability of the model forecasts to atmospheric initial states during strong and weak monsoon conditions is examined. For this purpose, a series of twin ensemble simulation experiments were performed starting from strong monsoon (SM) and weak monsoon (WM) initial conditions for a 6-year (2000-2005) period. The findings from the present study reveal that the member-to-member variance of the simulated rainfall and circulation over the Indian summer monsoon region are smaller for the forecasts initiated from WM initial conditions as compared to those initiated from SM initial conditions. It is further seen that the lower spread of the ensembles of the WM-based forecasts is related to the smaller growth of forecast error as compared to the SM-based forecasts. The potential predictability determined from computing the ""predictability ratio"" for a dynamical field like the zonal wind at 850 hPa shows higher potential predictability with longer lead-times of about 2-3 weeks in the case of WM-based forecasts. However, the lead-times of high potential predictability for the SM-based forecasts are found to be much shorter (similar to a few days).

While macroalgae are liable to cause dystrophic crises, macrophytes oxygenate and stabilise the sediment and thus control the nutrient flux into the water. A mathematical model was required by the Orbetello Lagoon Managerial Office to predict the development of both groups and test the actions to favour macrophytes over macroalgae, in the context of a decision support system. This model, developed for this need, takes into account the interactions between nutrients and the submersed vegetation in a 2D spatial context including a hydrodynamic model for the water movements and an ecological model describing the interactions between nutrients and the submersed vegetation. In the spatial grid the model operates with two interlocked modules: each cell implements the kinetics of nutrients, vegetation and their interactions, running on an hourly basis to keep track of the circadian cycles, whereas an advection/diffusion mechanism running on a daily basis exchanges information among all the grid cells. The model output consists of daily variations in nutrient concentrations and vegetation biomass showing the relative abundance of either group as a consequence of environmental conditions. After a sensitivity assessment, the model has been calibrated with data from the Orbetello Lagoon, where it can now be used as a forecasting tool to predict the development of vegetation and the relative advantage that macrophytes may have upon macroalgae.

Disturbance of feeding birds both day and night had a significant effect on the mortality and body condition of all three shorebird species, as did disturbance of roosting birds. Disturbance of feeding birds in the daytime only had a significant effect on dunlin mortality and body condition, but not that of curlew and oystercatchers. In the model, the creation of a buffer zone to reduce disturbance of feeding birds restored shorebird mortality and body condition to pre-disturbance levels. A new mudflat area was also effective in mitigating the effect of habitat loss on all three shorebirds and in mitigating the effect of roost disturbance on dunlin and curlew. However, a new mudflat area was not effective in mitigating the effect of roost disturbance on oystercatcher mortality and body condition.

As is typical for Populations that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids), and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each model to three long-term Population time series in Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence.",,,,"Briggs, Cheryl/F-7456-2013; Kendall, Bruce/C-1871-2008; Wood, Simon/B-3058-2010","Kendall, Bruce/0000-0003-1782-8106; Wood, Simon/0000-0002-2034-7453",,,,,44,46,5,37,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The partioning of the total variation in forest composition showed that the correlation of ferns and Melastomataceae with other forest plants was quite independent from that of soil, landscape, and space. Direct effects of ferns and Melastomataceae on other plants might be obtained from experimental studies of between-plant interactions, concentrating on the seedling or juvenile stages of trees and lianas, both above-ground as well as in the rooting environment.",,,,,"Sanchez, Mauricio/0000-0002-4983-436X",,,,,26,29,0,12,,,,1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAY,2005,178,1,,,,,1,13,,10.1007/s11258-004-1956-2,,,,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,,,WOS:000230845400001,,,,,

Although current patterns can be estimated from satellites, we lack the ability to predict future trends in response to climate change. We searched the literature for a common set of variables that might be combined into an index to quantify the greenness of vegetation throughout the year. We selected as variables: daylength (photoperiod), evaporative demand (vapor pressure deficit), and suboptimal (minimum) temperatures. For each variable we set threshold limits, within which the relative phenological performance of the vegetation was assumed to vary from inactive (0) to unconstrained (1). A combined Growing Season Index (GSI) was derived as the product of the three indices. Ten-day mean GSI values for nine widely dispersed ecosystems showed good agreement (r > 0.8) with the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also tested the model at a temperate deciduous forest by comparing model estimates with average field observations of leaf flush and leaf coloration. The mean absolute error of predictions at this site was 3 days for average leaf flush dates and 2 days for leaf coloration dates. Finally, we used this model to produce a global map that distinguishes major differences in regional phenological controls.

Future drinking water demand areas have been identified considering numerous variables such as: distance from the main city, road distance, topographic slopes, landuse/landcover, present population density, soils, floodplains, and the existing water supply system. A questionnaire has been conducted to compute the weights for these variables. Additional supplies that have to be provided for the next two decades have been computed and analysed with the present supply system.

The species composition and carbon storage capacity of northern Wisconsin (USA) forests are expected to change significantly as a result. Projected temperature changes are relatively large (up to a 5.8degreesC increase in mean annual temperature) and these forests encompass a broad ecotone that may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Our objective was to estimate the combined effects of climate change, common disturbances, and species migrations on regional forests using spatially interactive simulations. Multiple scenarios were simulated for 200 years to estimate aboveground live biomass and tree species composition. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) that includes individual tree species, biomass accumulation and decomposition, windthrow, harvesting, and seed dispersal. We used data from two global circulation models, the Hadley Climate Centre (version 2) and the Canadian Climate Center (version 1) to generate transient growth and decomposition parameters for 23 species. The two climate change scenarios were compared with a control scenario of continuing current climate conditions. The results demonstrate how important spatially interactive processes will affect the aboveground live biomass and species composition of northern Wisconsin forests. Forest composition, including species richness, is strongly affected by harvesting, windthrow, and climate change, although five northern species (Abies balsamea, Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca, Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa) are lost in both climate scenarios regardless of disturbance scenario. Changes in aboveground live biomass over time are nonlinear and vary among ecoregions. Aboveground live biomass will be significantly reduced because of species dispersal and migration limitations. The expected shift towards southern oaks and hickory is delayed because of seed dispersal limitations.",,,,"Scheller, Robert M/B-3135-2009","Scheller, Robert M/0000-0002-7507-4499",,,,,134,143,1,73,,,,1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Effects of initial epidemic conditions, sporulation rate, and spore dispersal gradient on the spatio-temporal dynamics of plant disease epidemics. Phytopathology 88, 1000-1012]. In a theoretical study, the authors showed the ability of their model to generate a broad range of disease patterns and disease progress rates. The objective of our study was to test if this theoretical approach was able to describe disease progress and the disease pattern of a specific disease, downy mildew (Peronospora parasitica) of radish (Raphanus sativus L.). Two field experiments with artificial inoculation were carried out and disease incidence and spatial pattern were assessed twice a week until disease incidence was greater than 0.25. Four model parameters were estimated by an algorithm that uses a least square regression together with an evolutionary optimisation strategy. Moran's I indices of spatial autocorrelation calculated both for measured und simulated data were significantly correlated (alpha = 0.05, r = 0.61). Also observed variances in measurements and in simulations were closely and significantly correlated (alpha = 0.05, r = 0.95). Thus, disease pattern (as assessed in terms of variance inflation and spatial autocorrelation) was well described by the model. The model accounted for 94% of the variation in the disease incidence data. It has, therefore, the potential to be developed into a forecast model for risk analysis and for decision support in plant protection. However, in the specific case of downy mildew on radish more experimental data are required for model validation and to parameterise the effects of environment on infection, sporulation and spore dispersal.

We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.",,,,"Scheuerell, Mark/N-6683-2016","Scheuerell, Mark/0000-0002-8284-1254",,,,,114,120,7,74,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2005,86,1,,,,,198,209,,10.1890/03-0408,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000226791700020,,,,,

Rate and parameters of such drain (0,01-2 % in year for Cs-137 and 0,1% - 4 % in year for Sr-90), define themselves as fundamental drains characteristic for big ecosystems like the Dnieper reservoir areas. The dramatic example of those phenomena of sorbptioning and desorbption of radionuclides (especially for Cs-137) in the closure of a reservoir cooler, the Kiev water basin and other superficial reservoirs, reflects the fundamental hydrological properties of water ecosystems. The following conclusion can be drawn. At any severe hydrological, biological and technological process in ecosystems polluted by radionuclides, an appreciable redistribution of radionuclides - tracers in biotic and a-biotic components ecosystems is observed. Also the inverse conclusion is possible therefrom. Therefore it is countable count that research of distribution and redistribution radionuclides on biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems may serve as an important tool to research of dynamics and to forecasting the condition of an ecosystems and its biota. The theory of radiocapacity of ecosystems developed hereby has permitted to assess the integrated characteristics of radionuclides distribution in ecosystems, to establish laws of radioecological processes and to determine the location of increases of radionuclides in ecosystems. The theory and models of radiocapacity of ecosystems have allowed to define approaches to a substantiation of ecological specifications on permissible levels of pollution in an ecosystem and their elements, and to permissible dumps and radionuclides emissions in ecosystems [1-3]. Our researches on reliability of ecosystems have shown a line of parameters, such as a variety of type of ecosystems; of biota; of number of species in ecosystems and rate of duplication of species. They form eventually the necessary ""integrated parameter"", suitable for an estimation of the general stability and reliability of ecosystems [2, 3, 4,5]. The definition however of such parameter demands a huge amount of initial data on contributing parameters at different stages of the life of ecosystems. Already on noticeable changes of the status of the ecosystem an estimation of their well-being and reliability can be made. Clearly, when in ecosystem as a whole, the variety of species decreases, the biota, number and speed of duplication of dominant kinds is reduced, then it is not difficult to observe a damage and/or an oppression of ecosystems. Such affirmative research is useful, but it is not enough, as it does not allow the making of an outstripping forecast of the condition of ecosystems nor to offer counter-measures. Radiocapacity - a sensory characteristic for the plant ecosystem's well-being is preferable. It is a non-dimensional quantity that characterises the part of radionuclides, which can be retained by the ecosystem without having deteriorated neither the whole system nor its parts. The only considerable effect on the ecosystem to be considered would the effect on the of radiocapacity rate factor. Separately, we based oneself on the theory, according to which the negative influence on the ecosystem would give rise to deterioration of its well-being; and, accordingly, - would be observe a reduction of the radiocapacity of the system. On the other hand, - the improvement of the ecosystems well-being would induce an increase of its of radiocapacity rate factor.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,1871-4668,,1-4020-3648-5,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,,,2005,2,,,,,,25,31,,10.1007/1-4020-3650-7_3,,,,Biophysics; Ecology; Nuclear Science & Technology,,,WOS:000233989600003,,,,,

However, these data may be patchy, and have gaps or biases. An alternative approach to generating C budgets has been to use process-based models, constructed to simulate the key processes involved in C exchange. However, the process of model building is arguably subjective, and parameters may be poorly defined. This paper demonstrates why data assimilation (DA) techniques - which combine stock and flux observations with a dynamic model - improve estimates of, and provide insights into, ecosystem carbon (C) exchanges. We use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to link a series of measurements with a simple box model of C transformations. Measurements were collected at a young ponderosa pine stand in central Oregon over a 3-year period, and include eddy flux and soil CO2 efflux data, litterfall collections, stem surveys, root and soil cores, and leaf area index data. The simple C model is a mass balance model with nine unknown parameters, tracking changes in C storage among five pools; foliar, wood and fine root pools in vegetation, and also fresh litter and soil organic matter (SOM) plus coarse woody debris pools. We nested the EnKF within an optimization routine to generate estimates from the data of the unknown parameters and the five initial conditions for the pools. The efficacy of the DA process can be judged by comparing the probability distributions of estimates produced with the EnKF analysis vs. those produced with reduced data or model alone. Using the model alone, estimated net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE)=-251+/-197 g C m(-2) over the 3 years, compared with an estimate of -419+/-29 g C m(-2) when all observations were assimilated into the model. The uncertainty on daily measurements of NEE via eddy fluxes was estimated at 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1), but the uncertainty on assimilated estimates averaged 0.47 g C m(-2) day(-1), and only exceeded 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) on days where neither eddy flux nor soil efflux data were available. In generating C budgets, the assimilation process reduced the uncertainties associated with using data or model alone and the forecasts of NEE were statistically unbiased estimates. The results of the analysis emphasize the importance of time series as constraints. Occasional, rare measurements of stocks have limited use in constraining the estimates of other components of the C cycle. Long time series are particularly crucial for improving the analysis of pools with long time constants, such as SOM, woody biomass, and woody debris. Long-running forest stem surveys, and tree ring data, offer a rich resource that could be assimilated to provide an important constraint on C cycling of slow pools. For extending estimates of NEE across regions, DA can play a further important role, by assimilating remote-sensing data into the analysis of C cycles. We show, via sensitivity analysis, how assimilating an estimate of photosynthesis - which might be provided indirectly by remotely sensed data - improves the analysis of NEE.",,,,"Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208",,,,,206,222,3,96,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

A reduction in the spawning stock biomass of herring may release jellyfish from competition for prey with herring and exacerbate any impact by jellyfish on herring survival. Both jellyfish abundance and the spawning success of herring fluctuate from year to year and increase under similar environmental conditions. The abundance of medusae (diameter = 1 to 47 cm, June to August) at herring spawning areas in the North Sea was correlated positively with the abundance of recently hatched herring larvae (< 1 cm, sampled 1 to 15 September 1971 to 1986), and this concurrence heightens the potential for competition. A significant negative relationship (p < 0.05) between the survival of herring to Age 0 and the abundance of the scyphozoan Aurelia aurita implies that this jellyfish might adversely impact the North Sea herring population. Furthermore, regression analyses suggest that climate variability may mediate the possible impact by A. aurita on herring survival and 0-group recruitment through changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and the abundance of the scyphozoan Cyanea capillata (r(2) > 0.60, p < 0.05).

In contrast, many species of birds hatch their young asynchronously over a period of days or weeks, handicapping last-hatched chicks with an age and size disadvantage. Numerous studies have examined the adaptive significance of this atypical hatching pattern, but few have attempted to explain the considerable intrapopulation variation that exists in hatching asynchrony. I explored proximate determinants of hatching asynchrony by monitoring 112 Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) nests in the grasslands of southern Saskatchewan, Canada, over 4 years. Age disparities between first- and last-hatched siblings (i.e., hatching spans) varied considerably, ranging between 1 and 7 days (mode = 4 days). These hatching spans increased with increased hatching success. Hatching spans also increased with larger clutches, but the increase was less than predicted given the increased time required to lay more eggs. Hatching span was unrelated to number of prey cached in the nest during egg laying (an index of food availability), and was unaltered by a year of superabundant prey. Furthermore, pairs given extra food during laying had hatching spans equal to those of unsupplemented control pairs. These results were inconsistent with both the energy constraint and facultative manipulation hypotheses, which predict that hatching asynchrony should vary with the level of food during laying, when incubation onset is determined. Burrowing Owls were apparently free of food limitation early in breeding, yet may not have been able to optimize hatching spans because food conditions during laying were largely unrelated to food conditions during brooding. Thus, one of the premises for facultative manipulation of hatching asynchrony-that laying females are able to forecast post-hatch food conditions-may not have been met for this population of Burrowing Owls.",,,,,,,,,,24,26,0,21,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2005,142,2,,,,,326,334,,10.1007/s00442-004-1727-8,,,,Ecology,,,WOS:000226285000018,15480800,,,,
